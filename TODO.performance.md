## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
1. **Build Performance Monitoring** - Establish baseline measurements
2. **Critical Path Optimization** - Focus on most impactful improvements
3. **Memory Leak Detection** - Identify and fix resource issues
4. **Basic Caching** - Implement fundamental caching strategies

### Phase 2: Optimization (Weeks 3-4)
1. **Bundle Optimization** - Reduce load times and resource usage
2. **Runtime Performance** - Optimize hot paths and algorithms
3. **Advanced Caching** - Implement sophisticated caching strategies
4. **Performance Testing** - Establish automated performance validation

### Phase 3: Advanced (Weeks 5-8)
1. **Infrastructure Optimization** - Optimize deployment and hosting
2. **Advanced Monitoring** - Implement comprehensive performance tracking
3. **Performance Culture** - Establish performance-first development practices
4. **Continuous Optimization** - Create ongoing performance improvement processes
