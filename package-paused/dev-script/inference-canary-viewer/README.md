# inference-canary-viewer

Static dashboard for inference canary results.
Generates a single-page HTML viewer from enriched artifacts produced by [inference-canary](../inference-canary/).

## How it works

The build script reads enriched artifact directories from the sibling `inference-canary` package,
groups them by (model, timestamp) to reconstruct per-run entries,
and renders a self-contained HTML dashboard with an external CSS stylesheet.

The output is static HTML with a small client-side script for syntax highlighting.
View switching uses native `<details>` elements with CSS `:has()` to hide non-open siblings.
Run detail overlays use the Popover API (`popover="auto"` + `popovertarget`) for light-dismiss behavior.
Syntax highlighting uses the CSS Custom Highlight API via Lezer tokenization;
code blocks degrade gracefully to unstyled monospace text when JavaScript is disabled
or the Highlight API is unavailable.

### Views

The dashboard provides three switchable views:

- **Overview**: combined all-models scatter plot of overall scores over time, plus a summary table with latest score, last run date, run count, degradation threshold, and status flags per model
- **By model**: collapsible `<details>` per model, each containing an overall score scatter plot with threshold line and nested per-probe breakdowns
- **By probe**: collapsible `<details>` per probe with a cross-model scatter plot showing all models overlaid, plus nested per-model breakdowns

Scatter plots are CSS-positioned `<button>` elements inside a relative container.
Each point opens a Popover API overlay via `popovertarget`.
Pass-1 scores render as filled circles; pass-2 (fix) scores render as hollow circles at the same X position.
Every chart has a backing `<table>` (visually hidden, accessible to screen readers) or a compact card grid when only two columns remain.

### Overlays

Run overlays show a probe grid with clickable cards linking to per-probe overlays.
Probe overlays include:

- Status badges (partial, error, non-stop finish reason)
- Collapsible timing and token usage metadata for initial and fix passes
- Source code with CSS Custom Highlight API syntax highlighting, or a side-by-side diff (via `git diff --no-index`) when a fix pass exists
- Collapsible reasoning traces, raw responses, fix prompts, and config snapshots rendered as markdown via micromark

### Data pipeline

1. Reads `meta.json`, `canary.ts`, and `response.txt` from each artifact directory under `src/canary-lint/`
2. Groups initial-pass and fix-pass artifacts by run key (`label::timestamp`)
3. Computes per-probe scores and overall score (mean of initial-pass probe scores)
4. Calculates per-model degradation thresholds (mean - 2 * stddev, floored at 0.3, minimum 3 samples)
5. Renders HTML via the `h()` builder from `module-es`
6. Builds CSS via `build-tool-css` and writes both files to `dist/final/`

## Usage

```bash
mise run build
```

### Development

Watch for source or canary-lint changes and rebuild automatically:

```bash
mise run dev:watch
```

Serve the built dashboard locally:

```bash
mise run dev:serve
```

Both combined:

```bash
mise run dev
```
