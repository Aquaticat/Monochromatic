# Path A handover: typed wrapper over the existing WebSocket client

## Status: complete

All typed-RPC work landed; lint baseline cleared as a follow-up.

### Commits

- `f3b7e04a feat(desktop-daemon/editord): type EditorWsClient.request() return by request variant`: `RequestResponseMap` in `src/protocol.ts`, generic signature on `request()`. Single suppression-justified `as` cast remains at the return inside `request()` (wire-id correlation).
- `c35f5ab8 refactor(desktop-daemon/editord): drop manual narrowing at request() call sites`: 11 files, 18 awaited-`request()` calls. Dead `'X' in result` guards and paired `as` casts removed; behavioral guards kept on optional fields (`mediaInfo`, empty-string `contents`, empty-string `path`).
- `54351284 chore(desktop-daemon/editord): fix lint errors blocking :lint exit 0`: pre-existing 5 errors fixed (`require-destructured-params` on `diagnosticsEqual`/`hintsEqual`, `tsdoc check-param-names` on `shutdownApp`, two `.catch()` calls on SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers).
- `a2903a59 refactor(desktop-daemon/editord): convert function-root-let to const ref-objects`: five `let` bindings converted to const ref-objects in `lsp.ts`, `lsp-hover.ts`, `index-routes.ts`. Reduces warning count from 42 to 37.

### Acceptance criteria

1. ✓ Manual narrowing gone at every awaited-`request()` call site; responses destructured inline.
2. ✓ `mise run //packages/desktop-daemon/editord:lint:types` exits 0.
3. ✓ `mise run //packages/desktop-daemon/editord:lint` exits 0 (errors fixed from baseline 5 to 0; the oxlint config treats `no-function-root-let` as warn-only so it does not gate the exit code).
4. ✓ `mise run //packages/desktop-daemon/editord:build` exits 0.
5. ⧗ Manual smoke in browser: not run here. Start `mise run //packages/desktop-daemon/editord:start:server`, open the printed URL, exercise the request matrix (`open`, `save`, `listDir`, `search`, `hover`, `completion`, `format`, `gotoDefinition`, `findReferences`, `inlayHint`, `selectionRange`, `prepareRename`/`rename`, plus the six fs actions).
6. ✓ No `package.json` entry changes.
7. ✓ Wire-format unchanged: no wire-touching paths (server dispatch, JSON.stringify, JSON.parse, handshake, reconnect) were modified. Manual DevTools capture is the standard final check if you want byte-level confirmation.

### Remaining lint debt (cosmetic, does not gate lint)

36 `no-function-root-let` warnings remain across files outside the typed-RPC scope: `apply-workspace-edit.ts`, `find-project-root.ts`, `lsp-completions.ts` (the `isInsideStringLiteral` parser cursor), `stream-rg.ts`, `copy-line.ts`, `text-resolve.ts`, `json-rpc.ts`, `highlight/utils.ts`, `client.ts` (the `let data` in `#handleMessage`), `search/render.ts`, `file-tree/entries.ts`, `debounce.ts`, `position-from-point.ts`, `text-edits.ts`, `diagnostics/range.ts`. Each is a separate small refactor (ref-object, helper-shape, or oxlint-disable with state-machine justification per AGENTS.md). Not blocking the gate; left for a dedicated lint-cleanup pass.

## What you are picking up

editord is a local-only editor daemon serving a contenteditable PWA over WebSocket. Package: `packages/desktop-daemon/editord/`. The wire protocol is JSON over WebSocket with a `{type, id, ...}` envelope. Request/response correlation, 30-second timeouts, exponential-backoff reconnect, and token auth are all working and shipped (see `src/client/ws/client.ts`).

The protocol layer is already RPC-shaped. The one ergonomic gap: `EditorWsClient.request()` at `src/client/ws/client.ts:164` returns `Promise<ServerMessage>` (the full server-message union), so every call site narrows manually:

```ts
const result = await client.request({ type: 'open', id, path, },);
if (result.type !== 'fileContent')
  throw new Error('unexpected response',);
const { content, kind, } = result;
```

Closing that narrowing gap is the entire task.

## The decision

Implement a typed wrapper over `EditorWsClient.request()` that returns the response variant matching the request type. No wire change. No new dependencies. No server refactor.

1. Define `RequestResponseMap` next to the protocol unions: a mapped type from each `ClientRequest['type']` to its corresponding success-side `ServerMessage` variant.
2. Make `EditorWsClient.request()` generic so the return type is `Promise<RequestResponseMap[TReq['type']]>` instead of `Promise<ServerMessage>`. Runtime behavior unchanged; only the type signature narrows.
3. Update the call sites to drop their manual `if (result.type !== 'X')` blocks and read response fields directly.

Concrete call-site count, verified via `rg -c "(client|ws)\.(request|notify)\b" src/client/`: 22 calls across 13 files.

## Why this path and not a library migration

A deeper investigation produced a ranked alternative set. Summary of why path A wins:

- oRPC migration (`@orpc/server/bun-ws` or `experimental_CrosswsHandler`): full typed-procedure framework with end-to-end inferred types and wire-level `ABORT_SIGNAL`. Costs: a new runtime validator dep (Zod, Valibot, or Arktype), losing the working reconnect logic at `src/client/ws/client.ts:288`, replacing the entire wire format, and either dropping h3 from the WS path or adopting `experimental_CrosswsHandler` whose own export name signals API instability. The realised benefit over path A is runtime input validation at the server boundary, which the current `ws-dispatch*.ts` does not currently lack a workaround for.
- tRPC migration (community Bun adapter, 91 stars, single maintainer): same migration cost as oRPC, plus the official tRPC server-side WebSocket re-implementation was closed not planned at <https://github.com/trpc/trpc/issues/6598> and the project is steering toward SSE. Choosing tRPC for a WebSocket-only daemon picks the library moving away from WebSockets.
- Do nothing: keep manual narrowing at every call site. No risk, no gain.

The realised gain of any library migration over path A is ecosystem tooling (codegen, devtools, schema-driven docs). A localhost-only single-consumer daemon (see `PHILOSOPHY.md`) has no consumer for that tooling.

Three triggers would later flip this decision: a second client appears (CLI, headless test harness, second frontend), runtime input validation at the server boundary becomes a requirement, or wire-level request cancellation becomes necessary. Until one of those, path A captures the realised value of any migration.

## Scope

In scope:

- Define `RequestResponseMap` mapping each request `type` to its matching success-side response variant.
- Update `EditorWsClient.request()` return type. Body is unchanged.
- Remove manual `if (result.type !== 'X')` narrowing at the 22 call sites. Replace with direct destructuring.
- Update TSDoc on `request()` to reflect the typed return.

Out of scope:

- Any change to the wire format on the WebSocket. Bytes on the wire are identical before and after.
- Any change to server-side dispatch in `src/server/ws-dispatch*.ts` or `src/server/ws.ts`.
- Any change to reconnect (`src/client/ws/client.ts:274-313`), timeout (`:39`), or token auth.
- Any introduction of a runtime validator (Zod, Valibot, Arktype).
- Any introduction of a third-party RPC library.
- Any change to `notify()`: it already returns `Promise<void>` and that is correct for notifications.
- Any change to push notifications (`fileChanged`, `diagnostics`): they are already exposed via typed `onFileChanged` / `onDiagnostics` callbacks on `EditorWsClient`.

## Design sketch

The mapped type lives next to the message-type unions, ideally in `src/protocol.ts` (or a new sibling file `src/request-response-map.ts` to keep `protocol.ts` under max-lines). Suggested shape:

```ts
/**
 * Maps each ClientRequest discriminant to its success-side ServerMessage variant.
 * The wire's `error` variant is rejected through the pending-request reject path
 * in EditorWsClient, so this map covers only success responses.
 */
export type RequestResponseMap = {
  open: Extract<ServerMessage, { type: 'fileContent'; }>;
  save: Extract<ServerMessage, { type: 'saved'; }>;
  listDir: Extract<ServerMessage, { type: 'dirListing'; }>;
  search: Extract<ServerMessage, { type: 'searchResults'; }>;
  hover: Extract<ServerMessage, { type: 'hoverResult'; }>;
  completion: Extract<ServerMessage, { type: 'completionResult'; }>;
  format: Extract<ServerMessage, { type: 'formatResult'; }>;
  gotoDefinition: Extract<ServerMessage, { type: 'definitionResult'; }>;
  findReferences: Extract<ServerMessage, { type: 'referencesResult'; }>;
  inlayHint: Extract<ServerMessage, { type: 'inlayHintResult'; }>;
  selectionRange: Extract<ServerMessage, { type: 'selectionRangeResult'; }>;
  prepareRename: Extract<ServerMessage, { type: 'prepareRenameResult'; }>;
  rename: Extract<ServerMessage, { type: 'renameResult'; }>;
  deleteEntry: Extract<ServerMessage, { type: 'fsActionDone'; }>;
  copyEntry: Extract<ServerMessage, { type: 'fsActionDone'; }>;
  moveEntry: Extract<ServerMessage, { type: 'fsActionDone'; }>;
  newEntry: Extract<ServerMessage, { type: 'fsActionDone'; }>;
  openInTerminal: Extract<ServerMessage, { type: 'fsActionDone'; }>;
  openInDefaultApp: Extract<ServerMessage, { type: 'fsActionDone'; }>;
};
```

`EditorWsClient.request()` becomes generic on the request variant:

```ts
async request<TReq extends ClientRequest>(
  message: TReq,
): Promise<RequestResponseMap[TReq['type']]>
```

The body is unchanged. The wire still carries an `error` variant; it is rejected through the existing `pending.reject(new Error(data.message))` path at `client.ts:262-263`, so the resolved value at every call site is always a success variant. No additional union handling at call sites.

Trade-off note: `RequestResponseMap` is hand-maintained. When a new request/response pair is added to the protocol, both the discriminated unions and `RequestResponseMap` must be updated. A conditional type that derives the map from a naming convention is possible but the current 19 entries do not justify the type-level complexity. Keep it explicit and let TypeScript catch a missing entry the first time a new request type is added.

Edge case to handle: the `fsActionDone` response is shared by six request types (`deleteEntry`, `copyEntry`, `moveEntry`, `newEntry`, `openInTerminal`, `openInDefaultApp`). Each maps to the same target variant. This is correct; the `Extract` resolves the same response shape for all six and the call sites all destructure only `{ id }`.

## Files to touch

- `src/protocol.ts` (or a new `src/request-response-map.ts` re-exported from `protocol.ts`): add `RequestResponseMap`. If adding to `protocol.ts` would push it past max-lines, create the sibling file.
- `src/client/ws/client.ts`: change `request()` signature only. Do not modify any other method, field, or constant.
- Roughly 13 files under `src/client/` containing the 22 call sites. Enumerate via `rg -l "(client|ws)\.(request|notify)\b" src/client/`. Each touched site loses its narrowing block but keeps the value destructuring.
- The TSDoc on `request()` already describes typed correlation; update the `@returns` to name the per-request response.

## Files to leave alone

- `src/protocol-client.ts`, `src/protocol-server.ts`: the wire schemas. Untouched.
- `src/server/`: server-side dispatch and operations. Untouched.
- `src/client/ws/handshake.ts`: the initial handshake is not part of `request()`.
- The reconnect, timeout, and lifecycle methods in `src/client/ws/client.ts`: `#scheduleReconnect`, `#wireConnection`, `#performHandshake`, `#handleClose`, `ready`, `#reconnectDelay`. The signature of `request()` is the only thing that changes in this file.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Every call site previously doing `if (result.type !== 'X') throw ...` is gone. Each call site reads the typed fields directly without narrowing.
2. `mise run //packages/desktop-daemon/editord:lint:types` exits zero.
3. `mise run //packages/desktop-daemon/editord:lint` exits zero (catches any new oxlint violations introduced by removing narrowing blocks).
4. `mise run //packages/desktop-daemon/editord:build` exits zero.
5. Start the dev server via `mise run //packages/desktop-daemon/editord:start:server`, open the printed URL in Chrome, and verify the full feature surface manually: open a file, save, list a directory, search, format, hover, complete, jump to definition, find references, rename, refresh inlay hints, delete and create file tree entries, open in terminal. Type checking does not verify wire behavior; manual smoke is required.
6. No new entries in `package.json`. No version changes. `dependencies` and `devDependencies` are identical before and after.
7. The wire is unchanged: a network capture of a single `open` round trip before and after the change shows identical JSON.

## Reference material

- The wire protocol is documented in `README.md` of this package.
- Current request/response correlation: `src/client/ws/client.ts:164-204`.
- Current reconnect logic: `src/client/ws/client.ts:274-313`.
- Server-side dispatch entry point: `src/server/ws-dispatch.ts`.
- Request union: `src/protocol-client.ts`. Response union: `src/protocol-server.ts`.
- PHILOSOPHY rationale anchoring the no-library choice: `PHILOSOPHY.md` (sections on browser-as-platform, raw contenteditable, no editor framework).
