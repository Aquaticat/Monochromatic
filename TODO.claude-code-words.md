The current words shown as status in Claude Code are too boring.
I propose:

[contents](./TODO.claude-code-words.contents.txt)

Words that are not included:

```txt
back-firing — implies failure/backlash
blabbing — disclosing secrets; betraying confidentiality
cursing — offensive language/uttering curses
exploiting — unethical abuse/taking unfair advantage
hexing — casting a harmful curse
scheming — plotting with malicious intent
tattling — informing/snitching on others
```
