# Completed Tasks & Reference

## Major Migrations and System Changes

### Husky to Moon Migration (June 2025) ✅

#### Completed Tasks
- [x] Research Moon's VCS hooks capabilities and configuration
- [x] Back up all package.json files with scripts to `bak/20250619_233329/`
- [x] Remove scripts from all package.json files
- [x] Setup Moon MCP server in ~/.claude.json for better task discovery
- [x] Create migration plan from Husky to Moon hooks
- [x] Get second opinion from Zen on the migration plan
- [x] Remove Husky configuration and dependencies
- [x] Implement Moon VCS hooks configuration
- [x] Test the new pre-commit hooks

#### Migration Summary
- Successfully removed Husky dependencies from package.json and pnpm-workspace.yaml
- Configured Moon VCS hooks in `.moon/workspace.yml` with simple command list:
  ```yaml
  hooks:
    pre-commit:
      - 'moon run :lint --affected'
      - 'moon run :test --affected'
  ```
- Moon automatically generated the bash script and synced to `.git/hooks/pre-commit`
- Pre-commit hook runs both linting and all tests (unit + browser) on affected files for optimal performance
- Hook successfully prevents commits when linting errors are found

#### Benefits Achieved
- Native integration with Moon build system
- Better performance using Moon's caching and affected file detection
- Simpler configuration with no separate tool to manage
- Consistent task definitions across build and hooks

#### Follow-up Tasks Completed
1. **Set up IDE integration**: ✅
   - Configure format-on-save for all developers
   - Ensure TypeScript language server is properly configured
   - Document recommended VS Code extensions in the project

2. **Strengthen CI pipeline**: ✅
   - Run full `moon run :build` on every PR
   - Run `moon run :format` in check mode
   - Make these CI checks required for merging

3. **Create convenience commands**: ✅
   - `moon run precommit` - manually run all pre-commit checks
   - `moon run validate` - run format + build + test for thorough local validation

### WSL Migration - Post-Migration Tasks (June 2025) ✅

#### Completed Migration Steps
1. **Install dependencies in WSL location** ✅
2. **Run initial setup** ✅
3. **Verify build system** ✅
4. **Set up VSCode for WSL** ✅
5. **Performance verification** ✅
6. **Clean up Windows copy** ✅

#### Migration Benefits Achieved
- Native Linux moon binary (no path translation issues)
- 10-50x faster file operations
- Better integration with Linux tooling
- Cleaner development environment

## Build System and Configuration Fixes

### Pre-commit Validation Issues Fixed (June 2025) ✅

#### Critical Build Issues Resolved
1. **ESLint config package not built** ✅
   - Fixed by running `moon run config-eslint:build`
   - This was blocking all ESLint validation

2. **Playwright system dependencies missing** ✅
   - Browser tests fail with: "Host system is missing dependencies to run browsers. Missing libraries: libX11-xcb.so.1"
   - Enhanced the `preparePlaywright` script to:
     - Detect OS (Linux/macOS/Windows) and Linux distribution
     - Detect WSL environment specifically
     - Run Playwright's built-in `install-deps` first
     - Fall back to manual apt-get/dnf installation for specific distros
     - Print clear manual installation instructions if automatic installation fails
     - Support Ubuntu/Debian, Fedora/RHEL, and Arch Linux with specific commands

#### Resolution Results
1. **Immediate**: Fix Playwright system dependencies installation ✅
2. **High**: Address TypeScript strict errors (blocking commits) ✅
   - Fixed type guard functions to use `unknown` instead of `any` ✅
   - Fixed error handling in catch blocks to use `unknown` ✅
   - Added explicit return types for Astro getStaticPaths functions ✅
   - Fixed Symbol property access on unknown types ✅
   - Fixed vite config iframe path issue ✅
   - Fixed empty test file causing test suite failures ✅
   - **Pre-commit hook now passes!** Commits are no longer blocked
   - Remaining: Some TypeScript errors in test files (can be addressed incrementally)

### TypeScript Configuration Fixes ✅

1. **TypeScript baseUrl Warnings**: ✅ Fixed by adding `baseUrl: "./"` to all tsconfig files (completed in commit 673787f)

## ESLint Configuration Cleanup (June 2025) ✅

### Configuration Changes Completed
- [x] Disable `jsdoc/tag-lines` - formatting concern, not linting
- [x] Disable `jsdoc/require-jsdoc` for test files
- [x] Add `param`, `args`, `props`, `ctx`, `var` to allowed abbreviations
- [x] Update test files to use function references in describe blocks (partial)
- [x] Add documentation about never using meaningless variable names like `i`
- [x] Fix `i` variable usage in fixture.promises.0to999.ts and fixture.generator.0to999.ts
- [x] Fix void expression issues in error.assert.equal.unit.test.ts (arrow functions)
- [x] Replace `window` with `globalThis` in figma plugin files
- [x] Fix `e` variable usage in catch blocks to use `error` instead

## Documentation and Standards

### Documentation Standards Established ✅

#### Technical Writing Guidelines
- Write in active voice without collective pronouns
- State facts directly without meta-references
- Use present tense for current state
- Eliminate unnecessary connecting phrases

#### Markdown Conventions
- One sentence per line for better diffs
- Use **bold** for emphasis, avoid _italics_
- Prefer fenced code blocks with language tags
- ATX-style headers with maximum 4 levels

#### Format Standards
- NEVER use emojis in documentation
- NEVER use ALL CAPS for headings
- Use sentence case for headings
- Use **bold** formatting instead of capitalization

### Git Commit Guidelines Established ✅

#### Conventional Commits Implementation
- Follow Conventional Commits specification
- Include ALL changes in comprehensive commit messages
- Use proper type/scope format
- Focus on "what" and "why", not just file changes
- Never use emojis in commit messages

## Code Quality Patterns and Learning

### Meilisearch Task Polling Implementation Evolution ✅

**Completed Learning Exercise**: Progressive simplification through "Do you really need..." questions:

1. ✅ Started with mutable `let taskStatus` and `while` loop with inline constants
2. ✅ "Do you really need a mutable variable?" → Moved to immutable `const` inside loop, hoisted constants
3. ✅ "Do you really need a while(true) break pattern?" → Changed to `while` with proper condition
4. ✅ "Do you really need a while loop at all?" → Changed to `for` loop with calculated iterations
5. ✅ "Do you really need a for loop?" → Changed to recursive helper function

#### Lessons Learned and Applied ✅
1. **Question every construct** - Each programming construct adds complexity
2. **Prefer immutability** - Mutable variables should be eliminated when possible
3. **Prefer declarative over imperative** - Loops can often be replaced with higher-order functions
4. **Extract and name concepts** - Helper functions like `isTaskPending` improve readability
5. **Think functionally first** - There's often a functional solution that's cleaner
6. **Simplify progressively** - Don't stop at the first working solution

## Priority Classifications Established ✅

### Completed Priority System
- ✅ **High Priority**: CLI tools development, Package.jsonc support and bidirectional sync
- ✅ **Normal Priority**: Multiple localized 404 pages, PlantUML integration, SVG optimization
- ✅ **Low Priority**: MDX formatting, Automatic translation integration, Dim sidebar on hover (on hold)
- ✅ **Completed/No Action Needed**: Astro RSS endpoint, lightningCSS resolver, fs-extra packageExtensions

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### Testing Requirements Established ✅

#### Test Structure Standards
- ✅ Use descriptive test names that explain expected behavior
- ✅ Group related tests using `describe` blocks
- ✅ Use `it.each` for parameterized tests
- ✅ Mock external dependencies using Vitest's mocking capabilities
- ✅ Test both happy path and error scenarios

#### Test File Setup Standards
- ✅ Always start Vitest files with proper imports and logtape configuration
- ✅ Use V8 ignore comments for untestable code paths
- ✅ Write corresponding Vitest files aiming for 100% test coverage
- ✅ Tests can only be run from workspace root using `moon run test`
