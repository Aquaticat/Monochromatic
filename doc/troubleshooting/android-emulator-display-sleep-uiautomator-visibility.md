# Emulator display sleep and uiautomator viewport visibility break capture runs

## Symptom

Long native capture runs over the folded cover display fail partway with
`Compose did not replace the Android launch splash on the cover display.`
even though the same candidate launches fine by hand.
The dumped hierarchy contains
only empty window bounds, and a screencap of the cover panel is fully black.

Separately, at 200% text a capture's expected markers vanish even while the screen is
awake: names that sit below the visible scroll viewport are absent from the hierarchy,
so marker lists that passed at 100% fail at 200%.

## Root cause

Two independent emulator behaviors:

1. The virtual display sleeps on its own timeout while a capture run is still working.
   `dumpsys power` reports `mWakefulness=Asleep`, Compose never draws, and
   `uiautomator dump` returns window shells without content.
   Waking the display
   (`input keyevent 224` plus `cmd window dismiss-keyguard`) makes the very same activity
   compose and dump correctly, which isolates sleep as the cause.
   `settings put global stay_on_while_plugged_in 7` alone did not hold across night-mode
   and font-scale changes during a run.
2. `uiautomator dump` omits nodes whose bounds fall outside the visible viewport of a
   scrolled container.
   At 200% text the picker's name wall scrolls, so names beyond the
   first screens are simply not in the XML, while at 100% everything fit and appeared.

## Verification

- With the display asleep, `uiautomator dump` yields only `bounds="[0,0][1080,2424]"`
  shells and screencap returns a black panel; after wake plus dismiss-keyguard the same
  dump contains the expected `text` and `content-desc` nodes.
- At 200% the hierarchy lists names only up to the visible viewport edge (for example
  through `Crystal Castles`) and then jumps to the deck, proving viewport culling rather
  than a composition failure.

## Verified workarounds

- Wake per capture inside the capture loop: `input keyevent 224`, then
  `cmd window dismiss-keyguard`, before `am start`; also pin
  `stay_on_while_plugged_in` to 7 at run start and restore the original value in the
  run's finally block.
- Choose capture markers that name nodes visible at the capture's font scale; at 200%
  prefer top-row and deck nodes over scrolled list names.
- Place pixel-sample coordinates inside the visible band for the capture's font scale
  (for the cover picker at 200%, the in-slot picker band sits around y 310 to 970 px, so
  samples use y 600 rather than y 1200).

## Upstream filing decision

None.
 Both behaviors are the emulator and uiautomator working as designed; the fixes
belong in the capture harness, not upstream.
