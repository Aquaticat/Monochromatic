# rclone v1.74.3 double-encodes a literal fullwidth colon into phantom S3 keys that Garage v2.3.0 lists but cannot HEAD, and bisync treats them as fatal

A filename containing a literal fullwidth colon `：` (U+FF1A,
 common in Chinese book titles)
can be written to an S3 bucket twice under two different keys when two sync passes apply
different rclone encoder masks.
The second,
 double-encoded key carries rclone's quote rune U+201B and becomes a phantom
duplicate:
 Garage lists it but returns `404` on `HeadObject`,
 so rclone bisync logs
`Failed to read metadata: object not found` and,
 on a normal run,
 aborts the whole sync.

This bites a single-node Garage (`dxflrs/garage:v2.3.0`) reached by rclone bisync on the
desktop and a new macOS client,
 and by FolderSync on Android,
 all against bucket `files`.

## Symptom

Two surface variants,
 same underlying phantom key.

Remote variant,
 seen during `rclone bisync garage:files/Plain ~/Plain --resync` on the new Mac:

```text
NOTICE: Text/Books/programming/01897_软件开发本质论‛‛：追求简约、体现价值、逐步构建.pdf: Failed to read metadata: object not found
NOTICE: Text/Books/self help/示例‛‛：第1卷.pdf: Failed to read metadata: object not found
NOTICE: Text/Books/self help/示例‛‛：第2卷.pdf: Failed to read metadata: object not found
NOTICE: Text/Books/self help/示例‛‛：第3卷.pdf: Failed to read metadata: object not found
```

Local variant,
 seen earlier on the desktop during a normal (non-resync) bisync,
 when the
double-encoded name had also been written to the local tree:

```text
ERROR : Text/Books/self help/示例‛‛：第1卷.pdf: Failed to copy: failed to open source object: lstat /home/user/Seafile/Plain/Text/Books/self help/示例‛‛：第1卷.pdf: no such file or directory
Bisync critical error: ...
Bisync aborted. Must run --resync to recover.
```

The trigger in both cases is the doubled quote rune `‛‛` (rendered by rclone;
 two literal
U+201B bytes) sitting immediately before a fullwidth colon `：` (U+FF1A) in the key.
The affected keys on the live bucket (5 real objects;
 the `.sdr/` directory entry is the
synthetic listing rclone shows for the fourth),
 all with intact clean twins:

```text
Text/Books/programming/01897_软件开发本质论‛‛：追求简约、体现价值、逐步构建.pdf
Text/Books/self help/示例‛‛：第1卷.pdf
Text/Books/self help/示例‛‛：第2卷.pdf
Text/Books/self help/示例‛‛：第2卷.sdr/
Text/Books/self help/示例‛‛：第2卷.sdr/metadata.pdf.lua
Text/Books/self help/示例‛‛：第3卷.pdf
```

## Root cause

### The byte-level difference

Raw S3 keys with rclone's display encoding disabled
(`rclone lsf --s3-encoding None ...`),
 hexdumped:

```text
clean   : 示例 ： 第1卷.pdf
          e7 a4 ba e4 be 8b                   ef bc 9a e7 ac ac 31 e5 8d b7 2e 70 64 66
tainted : 示例 ‛ ‛ ： 第1卷.pdf
          e7 a4 ba e4 be 8b e2 80 9b e2 80 9b ef bc 9a e7 ac ac 31 e5 8d b7 2e 70 64 66
```

The two keys are identical except for two `e2 80 9b` (U+201B) bytes inserted before the
fullwidth colon `ef bc 9a` (U+FF1A).
U+201B is rclone's encoder quote rune and nothing else in this stack (Garage,
 the S3
protocol,
 FolderSync,
 the OS filesystems) emits it,
 so the insertion is rclone's.

### Why rclone inserts it

rclone's encoder reserves U+201B as its quote rune:

```go
// lib/encoder/encoder.go:29-30
// QuoteRune is the rune used for quoting reserved characters
QuoteRune = '‛' // SINGLE HIGH-REVERSED-9 QUOTATION MARK
```

When the `EncodeColon` flag is set,
 the encoder maps ASCII `:` to the fullwidth `：`
(`r + fullOffset`,
 `fullOffset = 0xFEE0`),
 and to keep that reversible it quotes a
*literal* fullwidth `：` by prefixing the quote rune:

```go
// lib/encoder/encoder.go:537-545
if mask.Has(EncodeColon) { // :
    switch r {
    case ':':
        out.WriteRune(r + fullOffset)   // ':'  -> '：'
        continue
    case '：':
        out.WriteRune(QuoteRune)        // '：' -> '‛：'  (quoted so decode restores the fullwidth colon)
        out.WriteRune(r)
        continue
    }
}
```

A literal quote rune in the input is itself escaped by doubling,
 regardless of mask:

```go
// lib/encoder/encoder.go:452-454
case '␀', QuoteRune:
    out.WriteRune(QuoteRune)
    out.WriteRune(r)   // '‛' -> '‛‛'
```

So a single pass with `EncodeColon` turns the clean title `示例：第1卷.pdf` into
`示例‛：第1卷.pdf` (one quote rune).
A second pass with a mask that lacks `EncodeColon` (the S3 backend default,
 see below)
then sees that lone quote rune as a literal and doubles it,
 producing `示例‛‛：第1卷.pdf`
(two quote runes) as a brand new,
 distinct S3 key alongside the original.

The S3 backend default mask has no `EncodeColon`:

```go
// backend/s3/s3.go:529-531
Default: encoder.EncodeInvalidUtf8 |
    encoder.EncodeSlash |
    encoder.EncodeDot,
```

The two passes with mismatched masks are the generator.
In this deployment the likely source of the colon-encoding pass is a second client writing
to the same bucket (Android FolderSync,
 whose target filesystems forbid `:`),
 while the
rclone desktop client writes with the S3 default;
 either order across the two clients
yields the doubled key.

### The proximate failure is Garage, not an rclone round-trip bug

A reasonable first hypothesis is that rclone's `encode`/`decode` is not idempotent for these
keys,
 so rclone asks Garage for the wrong key.
That hypothesis is wrong,
 and the evidence disproves it.

The S3 backend lists keys through `ToStandardName` and re-derives request keys through
`FromStandardName`:

```go
// lib/encoder/encoder.go:1234-1238 and 1263-1268
func FromStandardName(e Encoder, s string) string {
    if e == Standard { return s }
    return e.Encode(Standard.Decode(s))
}
func ToStandardName(e Encoder, s string) string {
    if e == Standard { return s }
    return Standard.Encode(e.Decode(s))
}
```

Running the real stored bytes through this exact chain (harness below) yields
`FromStandardName(ToStandardName(tainted)) == tainted`:
 the round trip is stable,
 and the
display form rclone shows (`lsf`) is `‛‛：` because `Standard.Encode` re-doubles the quote.
The wire confirms it:
 rclone issues a HEAD for the byte-exact stored key and Garage answers
`404`,
 while the clean twin answers `200`:

```text
HEAD /files/.../%E2%80%9B%E2%80%9B%EF%BC%9A...第1卷.pdf  ->  HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found   (tainted)
HEAD /files/.../%EF%BC%9A...第1卷.pdf                    ->  HTTP/1.1 200 OK          (clean twin)
```

`%E2%80%9B%E2%80%9B%EF%BC%9A` is U+201B U+201B U+FF1A,
 the exact stored key.
So rclone requests the right key;
 Garage v2.3.0 returns `404` on `HeadObject` for a key its
`ListObjectsV2` returns with a real size.
That list/HEAD inconsistency,
 on a key that rclone double-encoding created,
 is the proximate
cause of `Failed to read metadata: object not found`.

### What Garage is doing internally

The two S3 operations resolve the object through different table accesses,
 and for these keys
they disagree.

`ListObjects` range-scans the object table and reports the first version that holds data:

```rust
// src/api/s3/list.rs:809
let version = match object.versions().iter().find(|x| x.is_data()) {
```

`HeadObject` (and `GetObject`) instead do a point lookup by exact key,
 then require a data
version:

```rust
// src/api/s3/get.rs:183-194
let object = garage
    .object_table
    .get(&bucket_id, &key.to_string())
    .await?
    .ok_or(Error::NoSuchKey)?;        // object missing under exact key -> 404
let object_version = object
    .versions()
    .iter()
    .rev()
    .find(|v| v.is_data())
    .ok_or(Error::NoSuchKey)?;        // no readable version -> 404
```

`is_data()` is true only for a completed,
 non-tombstone version
(`src/model/s3/object_table.rs:686-694`:
 `Complete(DeleteMarker) => false`,
 other `Complete`
`=> true`,
 `Uploading`/`Aborted` `=> false`).
On the single node both the range scan and the point lookup read the same LMDB tree keyed by
`(partition_key.hash(), sort_key)` (`src/table/table.rs:287-314`),
 so for identical key bytes
they must agree;
 here they do not,
 which is a localized metadata-reference inconsistency on
those specific object rows.
Garage documents this class and ships repairs for it:

```text
# doc/book/operations/durability-repairs.md:138-145
... if an object is deleted, the underlying versions or data blocks may still be held ...
- garage repair versions:   purges any orphan version
- garage repair block-refs: purges any orphan block reference
```

It is not systemic:
 the Mac resync issued a metadata read for all ~9018 objects and only these
6 failed,
 and the clean twins return real bytes (`rclone cat` on the clean key yields
`%PDF-1.4`).
The phantom rows' `LastModified` advances to the current time on every `lsjson` (13:24:46 on
one call,
 13:39:09 on the next),
 which is rclone's `time.Now()` fallback when its per-object
modtime HEAD 404s,
 not an active rewrite;
 nothing is recreating the keys.

### Why one bad object is fatal

rclone bisync escalates a per-object failure during resync to a critical error that aborts
the run and forces a fresh `--resync`:

```go
// cmd/bisync/resync.go (b.critical set on copy/list failures, e.g. lines 67, 94, 116, 126, 150, 157, 166)
b.critical = true
```

With `b.critical` set,
 bisync prints `Bisync aborted. Must run --resync to recover` rather
than skipping the single un-HEADable source object and continuing.
`--resilient` and `--recover` do not downgrade this to a skip.

## Verification

Versions under test:

- rclone `v1.74.3` (Homebrew on the Mac and the desktop binary;
   both ends).
- rclone source read at commit `df9935d71ef553eff775e6e3394baaac06d45173`
  (`VERSION` = `v1.75.0`);
   the encoder constants and the `EncodeColon` path are long-standing
  and unchanged from `v1.74.3`.
- Garage `dxflrs/garage:v2.3.0`,
   single node,
   bucket `files`,
   behind self-managed Caddy.

### Harness 1: the encoder round trip (Go, offline)

A throwaway module that replaces `github.com/rclone/rclone` with the local clone and calls
`lib/encoder` directly.
 `go.mod`:

```go
// go.mod
module encharness

go 1.26

require github.com/rclone/rclone v0.0.0

replace github.com/rclone/rclone => /tmp/agent/rclone-enc-20260608
```

```go
// main.go
package main

import (
    "fmt"

    "github.com/rclone/rclone/lib/encoder"
)

func main() {
    const (
        quote = "‛" // U+201B rclone QuoteRune
        fwc   = "：" // U+FF1A fullwidth colon (legit char in the title)
    )
    s3 := encoder.EncodeInvalidUtf8 | encoder.EncodeSlash | encoder.EncodeDot
    win := s3 | encoder.EncodeColon

    clean := "示例" + fwc + "第1卷.pdf"
    tainted := "示例" + quote + quote + fwc + "第1卷.pdf"

    // Origin: a Colon-mask pass then an S3-default pass reproduces the stored bytes.
    fmt.Println("mixed double-encode == tainted?", s3.Encode(win.Encode(clean)) == tainted)
    // Round trip the S3 backend actually uses is stable (so HEAD asks for the right key):
    fmt.Println("backend round trip stable?    ",
        s3.FromStandardName(s3.ToStandardName(tainted)) == tainted)
    // The clean twin also round trips:
    fmt.Println("clean round trip stable?      ",
        s3.FromStandardName(s3.ToStandardName(clean)) == clean)
}
```

Run with `GOFLAGS=-mod=mod GOPROXY=off GOSUMDB=off go run .`.
 Output:

```text
mixed double-encode == tainted? true
backend round trip stable?     true
clean round trip stable?       true
```

The first `true` proves the origin;
 the second proves rclone requests the byte-exact stored
key,
 disproving the round-trip-bug hypothesis.

### Harness 2: list works, HEAD 404 (rclone against the live bucket, read only)

```bash
# the phantom key: LIST returns it with a real size, HEAD 404s it
rclone lsl "garage:files/Plain/Text/Books/self help/" | grep '示例'
#   4492720 ... 示例‛‛：第1卷.pdf      <- phantom, real size
#   4492720 ... 示例：第1卷.pdf        <- clean twin, identical size
name='示例‛‛：第1卷.pdf'
rclone --dump headers --low-level-retries 1 --retries 1 \
  lsjson --stat "garage:files/Plain/Text/Books/self help/$name" 2>&1 | grep -iE 'HEAD /|HTTP/1.1'
#   HEAD /files/.../%E2%80%9B%E2%80%9B%EF%BC%9A...第1卷.pdf HTTP/1.1
#   HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
```

Patterns that work cleanly:
 any key whose name has no fullwidth colon;
 the clean twins
(`示例：第N卷.pdf`),
 which HEAD `200` with their true sizes (4492720,
 5896878,
 8159462).

Patterns that fail:
 the doubled-quote keys listed in Symptom,
 every one of which lists
with a real size but HEADs `404`.

## Verified workarounds

### Why nothing regenerates them (prevention is already satisfied)

The double-encode needs two rclone passes whose masks disagree on `EncodeColon`,
 and the quote
rune is rclone-exclusive,
 so a non-rclone client (Android FolderSync) cannot create one.
This deployment now has three rclone clients (desktop,
 Mac,
 Windows laptop),
 all on the
S3 default mask (`InvalidUtf8,Slash,Dot`,
 no colon) with clean local trees (verified:
 zero
`‛` files locally,
 no `encoding` override on the remote),
 so no active client writes `‛` keys.
The phantoms (5 as of 2026-06) are stale artifacts of the one-time Seafile-to-Garage migration.
If more rclone clients are ever added,
 keep them all on one explicit `--s3-encoding`;
 nothing
needs to encode the fullwidth colon (it is legal on Linux,
 macOS,
 and Android),
 so the default
mask is safe everywhere and no mismatch can arise.

### Exclude the phantoms with a filter (the working fix, deployed)

A bisync filter that drops any path containing the quote rune stops every client from listing
or HEADing the phantoms,
 so the run no longer aborts:

```text
# garage-filter.txt   (the ‛ is a literal U+201B; file bytes: 2d 20 2a 2a e2 80 9b 2a 2a 0a)
- **‛**
```

```bash
rclone bisync garage:files/Plain <local> --resync --filter-from <path>/garage-filter.txt ...
```

The pattern must be `- **‛**` (full path),
 not `- *‛*` (base name).
 rclone matches a
slash-free pattern against the base name only,
 so `- *‛*` drops a phantom file
(`…‛‛：第2卷.pdf`) but keeps one nested in a phantom directory
(`…‛‛：第2卷.sdr/metadata.pdf.lua`,
 base name `metadata.pdf.lua`).
 A default-modtime run hides
that gap,
 because it HEADs every object while building the listing and silently drops the
un-HEAD-able phantom before the transfer stage.
 With `--use-server-modtime` (compare on the
listing's LastModified,
 no per-object HEAD) that self-heal is gone,
 so the filter is the only
guard,
 and `- *‛*` lets the nested phantom reach the transfer and abort the run.
 Verified by
point-get:
 `- **‛**` drops exactly the phantom rows (5 as of 2026-06) and keeps every real
file,
 and a `--resync` with `--use-server-modtime` on each client succeeds transferring 0 B.

Use `--filter-from` (a file),
 not an inline `--filter`,
 so the same literal bytes ride every
invocation and the systemd/launchd/Task-Scheduler units stay readable.
Changing the filter between runs makes bisync abort with "filters have changed",
 so the first
run after adding it must include `--resync`.
Deployed on all three clients (desktop systemd unit,
 Mac launchd agent,
 Windows Task Scheduler
job),
 each passing `--filter-from .../garage-filter.txt --fast-list --use-server-modtime`,
 each
re-baselined once with `--resync`.
Tradeoff:
 the phantom rows still exist in a raw bucket listing and the filter stays on every
client;
 it is set once,
 not a per-run chore.
Since every writer uses the default encoding with a clean local tree (verified:
 zero `‛` files
locally,
 no `encoding` override on the remote),
 nothing regenerates them,
 so the filter is a
stable end state,
 not a recurring patch.

### What cannot remove the phantoms (all tested against the live node)

None of these clear the stuck list entries;
 only a metadata wipe plus re-push does.

S3 `DELETE` is a silent no-op.
 Garage's delete handler point-gets the object first and
short-circuits when that returns nothing,
 the same point-get that already fails here:

```rust
// src/api/s3/delete.rs (handle_delete_internal, then handle_delete)
let object = garage
    .object_table
    .get(bucket_id, &key.to_string())
    .await?
    .ok_or(Error::NoSuchKey)?; // No need to delete -> the DeleteMarker insert is skipped
// handle_delete: Ok(_) | Err(Error::NoSuchKey) => 204 No Content
```

`DeleteObject` returns `204` but writes no tombstone.
 This is why the earlier local-only
cleanups never held:
 deleting the doubled-name files made bisync propagate a remote `DELETE`,
Garage answered `204`,
 and the phantom stayed listed.

S3 `PUT` then `DELETE` heals the point-get but still does not unlist it.
 Writing one byte to a
phantom key rewrites the canonical row (HEAD `404` becomes `200`),
 and a following `DELETE`
then writes a real tombstone (HEAD `404` again,
 confirmed).
 But `LIST` still returns the key:
the range-scan index keeps a separate stale entry that the canonical write never touched.

`garage repair tables` does not reconcile it.
 Tested:
 5+ minutes after
`garage repair --yes tables`,
 all were still listed and the tombstoned vol 1 still
appeared.
 On a single node a Merkle resync has no peer to reconcile against,
 and
`garage offline-repair` only rebuilds counters (`object_counters`),
 not object rows.

The only route to a pristine bucket is to stop Garage,
 delete its metadata and data dirs,
redeploy (the compose auto-recreates the bucket),
 and re-push every object from a clean
client.
 The data is safe to lose at the S3 layer (every phantom has an intact,
 HEADable clean
twin),
 so this is a choice about listing hygiene,
 not data recovery.

## What does not work

- Treating it as an rclone `encode`/`decode` asymmetry and patching the encoder:
   disproven.
  Harness 1 shows the backend round trip is stable and Harness 2 shows rclone HEADs the exact
  stored bytes;
   the `404` is Garage's.
- `--resilient` / `--recover`:
   do not downgrade the critical abort to a per-object skip;
   the
  desktop run still aborted with `Must run --resync to recover`.
- Re-running `--resync`:
   re-establishes the baseline but leaves the phantom keys in place,
  so the next run trips on them again.
- Deleting only the local doubled-name files (the desktop's earlier patch):
   clears the local
  `lstat` variant but leaves the remote phantom keys,
   which still break every client that
  lists the bucket.

## Upstream filing decision

Default policy is do not file.
 Two candidate targets,
 neither cleanly fileable as-is.

Duplicate search:
 `gh search issues --repo rclone/rclone` for `encoding double`,
`201b quote rune`,
 and `object not found encoding bisync` returned nothing,
 but `gh search`
is rate-limited in this environment (see [gh-search-rate-limit.md](gh-search-rate-limit.md)),
so the empty result is weak evidence.
Garage's tracker is self-hosted Gitea at `git.deuxfleurs.fr`,
 not reachable through `gh`,
 so
the Garage side was not searched.

Constraint walk:

1. Upstream's fault?
    Split.
    The double-encode needs a cross-client mask mismatch,
    which is a
   pipeline/config condition,
    not a single-pass rclone defect.
    The bisync-aborts-on-one-bad-
   object behavior is arguably an rclone robustness defect.
    The list/HEAD inconsistency is a
   metadata-reference inconsistency that Garage documents and ships repairs for
   (`garage repair versions`/`tables`,
    durability-repairs.
   md),
    i.e. a known operational
   condition rather than an unreported defect.
2. Can upstream fix it?
    rclone could skip an un-HEADable source object with a warning instead
   of a critical abort;
    Garage could make HEAD consistent with LIST.
    Both fixable in principle.
3. Supporting the use case?
    Yes for both (S3 sync of arbitrary UTF-8 keys is core to each).
4. Would the repo welcome it?
    Not assessed;
    no prototype prepared.
5. Will they likely fix it?
    Unknown;
    trackers not adequately searched (rate limit;
    Gitea).
6. Minimal fix prototyped?
    No.

Prototype abandoned deliberately,
 not skipped silently:
 the rclone origin is a config
mismatch rather than a clear defect,
 confirming the Garage list/HEAD inconsistency as a bug
would need Garage-source tracing that is out of scope for the immediate goal (recovering the
user's bucket),
 and Garage is not filable through the tooling here.
The user's actionable fix is the cleanup plus encoder alignment above,
 not an upstream patch.

Kept draft,
 do not file as-is,
 for the more defensible rclone-side robustness gap:

~~~md
Title: bisync aborts the whole run on a single un-HEADable source object even with --resilient

Labels: bug, bisync

A remote S3 object that ListObjectsV2 returns but HeadObject 404s (here: a Garage key that an
earlier mismatched-encoding pass double-encoded) makes `rclone bisync` log
`Failed to read metadata: object not found` and then escalate to a critical abort
(`Bisync aborted. Must run --resync to recover`), rather than skipping that one object and
continuing. `--resilient` and `--recover` do not change this.

Repro: put one object whose key cannot be HEADed (or simulate a backend returning 404 on HEAD
for a listed key), then run bisync against a populated tree; the whole run aborts.

Source: cmd/bisync/resync.go sets b.critical on the copy/list failure path; with b.critical
set the run aborts. A skip-with-warning path for a single un-readable source object would let
the rest of the sync complete.

(Reproduction harness, byte-level evidence, and the encoder double-encode mechanism that
created the offending key are in our internal troubleshooting notes; this report covers only
the bisync abort behavior. Drafted with AI assistance; reproduction and source trace
verified by hand.)
