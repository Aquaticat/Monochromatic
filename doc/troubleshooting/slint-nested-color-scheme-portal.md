# Slint 1.18.1 nested Wayland clients take dark and light appearance from the session bus, at startup and on change

## Symptom

Running a Slint application inside a nested Wayland compositor isolates its surface,
input,
and screenshots,
but does not isolate `Palette.color-scheme`.
Changing only the nested compositor cannot produce deterministic dark and light scenes.
Changing the host desktop environment theme does work,
but mutates unrelated user state and is forbidden for fixture verification.

Before 2026-10-05 the nested fixture could only fix the appearance at startup.
A hosted client kept its startup scheme for the whole session,
so "appearance follows the system when its preference changes" could not be verified
without touching host desktop settings.

## Root cause

Wayland has no general dark or light preference protocol.
Slint 1.18.1 reads desktop appearance over the session D-Bus instead of the Wayland connection.
The deciding source is `i-slint-backend-winit-1.18.1/xdg_desktop_settings.rs`,
read from the cargo registry of the IDE build volume.

### Where the value comes from

The watcher opens the session bus and addresses the Settings portal by its well-known name:

```rust
// i-slint-backend-winit-1.18.1/xdg_desktop_settings.rs:220
    let connection = zbus::Connection::session().await?;
    let settings_proxy: zbus::Proxy = zbus::proxy::Builder::new(&connection)
        .interface("org.freedesktop.portal.Settings")?
        .path("/org/freedesktop/portal/desktop")?
        .destination("org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop")?
        .build()
        .await?;
```

A nested Wayland child inherits the parent process's `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` unless the fixture overrides it.
The child therefore reads the host portal even though `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` points at the nested compositor.

Initial reads call `ReadOne(namespace, key)` and fall back to `Read` only for `UnknownMethod`
(`xdg_desktop_settings.rs:183` to `197`).
The value mapping is:

```rust
// i-slint-backend-winit-1.18.1/xdg_desktop_settings.rs:98
fn xdg_color_scheme_to_slint(value: zbus::zvariant::OwnedValue) -> ColorScheme {
    match value.downcast_ref::<u32>() {
        Ok(1) => ColorScheme::Dark,
        Ok(2) => ColorScheme::Light,
        _ => ColorScheme::Unknown,
    }
}
```

The first windows wait up to `500ms` for that query (`APPEARANCE_QUERY_TIMEOUT`,
`xdg_desktop_settings.rs:17`),
so a slow or missing portal delays the first frame rather than flashing a default theme.

### What the toolkit listens for after startup

Slint subscribes to one signal,
before its initial reads,
and applies every later change from the signal's own arguments:

```rust
// i-slint-backend-winit-1.18.1/xdg_desktop_settings.rs:232
    let mut settings_stream = settings_proxy.receive_signal("SettingChanged").await?;

    read_all_settings(&settings_proxy, &cx).await;
```

```rust
// i-slint-backend-winit-1.18.1/xdg_desktop_settings.rs:239
    while let Some(message) = settings_stream.next().await {
        let Ok((namespace, key, value)) =
            message.body().deserialize::<(String, String, zbus::zvariant::OwnedValue)>()
        else {
            continue;
        };
        if let Some(setting) = SETTINGS.iter().find(|s| s.namespace == namespace && s.key == key) {
            (setting.apply)(value, &cx);
        }
    }
```

Two properties of that subscription decide whether an emitted signal is heard.
Neither failure is logged.

The body must be exactly two strings and a variant (D-Bus signature `ssv`).
A body carrying the integer directly (`ssu`) fails the tuple deserialization and is skipped by the `continue`.

The signal must come from the connection that owns `org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop`.
zbus 5.19.0 builds the match rule from the proxy's destination
and then filters every delivered message by that owner's unique name:

```rust
// zbus-5.19.0/src/proxy/mod.rs:1138
        let mut rule_builder = MatchRule::builder()
            .msg_type(Type::Signal)
            .sender(proxy.destination())?
            .path(proxy.path())?
            .interface(proxy.interface())?;
```

```rust
// zbus-5.19.0/src/proxy/mod.rs:1268
    fn filter(&mut self, msg: &Message) -> Result<bool> {
        let header = msg.header();
        let sender = header.sender();
        if sender == self.src_unique_name.as_ref() {
            return Ok(true);
        }
```

A second connection on the same bus emitting an otherwise identical signal is discarded.

The applied value reaches Slint markup through a dependency-registering property,
so bindings re-evaluate without any window event:
`apply_color_scheme_value` calls `ctx.set_color_scheme(scheme)` (`xdg_desktop_settings.rs:117`),
which sets `SlintContext::color_scheme` (`i-slint-core-1.18.1/context.rs:267`),
and `Palette.color-scheme` in the default `fluent` style reads it through
`SlintInternal.color-scheme` (`i-slint-compiler-1.18.1/widgets/fluent/color-scheme.slint:5`).

### What the portal contract says

Read on 2026-10-05 from `data/org.freedesktop.portal.Settings.xml` in `flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal`,
last changed by commit `3255665df016bcc46cb91793714310f0c1e36cba`.
That file documents version 2 of the interface.

- `org.freedesktop.appearance` `color-scheme` has type `u`:
  `0` no preference,
  `1` prefer dark,
  `2` prefer light.
  Unknown values are treated as `0`.
- The signal is `SettingChanged (s namespace, s key, v value)`,
  described as "Emitted when a setting changes."
  A request for the value already served is not a change,
  so it emits nothing.
- `ReadOne` returns the value in one variant layer.
  The deprecated `Read` is documented as actually returning two layers.

## Isolated solution

`package/cli/nested-wayland-session` supports a startup option and a runtime control command:

```sh
monochromatic-nested-wayland-session --socket /tmp/nws.sock --color-scheme dark -- app

printf 'color-scheme light\n' | nc -U /tmp/nws.sock   # => ok changed
printf 'color-scheme light\n' | nc -U /tmp/nws.sock   # => ok unchanged
```

For either explicit startup value,
the fixture:

1.  Creates a disposable socket directory under runtime temporary storage.
2.  Starts a private `dbus-daemon --session --nofork` message bus.
3.  Registers a minimal zbus `org.freedesktop.portal.Settings` service.
4.  Serves `ReadOne`,
    `Read`,
    and filtered `ReadAll` for appearance color scheme.
5.  Sets `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` only on the hosted child.
6.  Kills the private bus and removes its socket directory when the nested session ends.

The `color-scheme dark|light` control command,
implemented in `package/cli/nested-wayland-session/src/appearance_portal.rs` as `AppearancePortal::set_color_scheme`:

1.  Replaces the served value first,
    so a client that re-reads when notified gets the announced value.
2.  Returns `ok unchanged` without emitting when that value was already served.
3.  Otherwise emits `SettingChanged` with body `("org.freedesktop.appearance", "color-scheme", <uint32>)`
    from the same connection that owns `org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop`,
    and returns `ok changed`.
4.  Restores the previous value and returns `err` if the emission fails,
    so a retry notifies again.

The command never opens another bus.
A session started without `--color-scheme` has no private bus,
and the command answers `err` naming that option instead of using the bus the compositor inherited.

Unsupported individual settings return a D-Bus error rather than inventing host font,
cursor,
or accent values.
Normal shutdown removes the temporary socket directory;
`SIGKILL` bypasses cleanup and can leave the PID-named directory behind.
Without `--color-scheme`,
the fixture does not replace the child's session bus.

```

### Passing cases

Measured on 2026-10-05.

- `test:all` reports 56 passing tests.
  The run happens in the package's build container,
  because this host lacks the compositor's development libraries.
- `runtime_switch_changes_value_served_by_every_read_method`:
  `ReadOne`,
  `Read`,
  and `ReadAll` serve `2` after a switch to light and `1` after a switch back.
- `runtime_switch_emits_setting_changed_only_for_real_changes`:
  a second client subscribes the way Slint does (proxy addressed to the well-known name,
  `receive_signal("SettingChanged")`),
  decodes the body as `(String, String, OwnedValue)`,
  checks signature `ssv`,
  and reads the value back at delivery time.
- `runtime_switch_never_contacts_environment_session_bus`:
  the test re-executes itself with `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` naming a disposable decoy bus,
  performs a switch,
  then requires that the first connection the decoy ever reported is the test's own sentinel.
- `inspect:color-scheme` against the release binary,
  with the host session reporting `LockedHint=yes`:
  Slint reported `dark -> light -> dark`,
  `gdbus monitor` on the private bus recorded exactly
  `SettingChanged ('org.freedesktop.appearance', 'color-scheme', <uint32 2>)` then `<uint32 1>`,
  `gdbus call ... ReadOne` returned `(<uint32 2>,)` and `(<uint32 1>,)` after the respective switches,
  screenshots differed between dark and light and matched between the two dark states,
  and recorded frames had background luminance 28 (dark) and 250 (light).
  The decoy session bus in the compositor's own environment saw one connection,
  the task's sentinel,
  and no `SettingChanged`.

### Failing cases

- Before the implementation (commit `0dd5179fd`),
  `test:all` reported 43 passed and 7 failed:
  the three runtime portal tests,
  both control-response tests,
  and both parse tests for the new verb.
- With each guard removed in a disposable copy of the package,
  the committed tests fail as follows.
  No signal emitted:
  the emission test times out waiting for `SettingChanged`.
  Body `ssu` instead of `ssv`:
  the emission test fails to decode the body.
  Signal emitted for an unchanged value:
  the emission test receives `1` where it requires `2`.
  Signal emitted from a second connection on the private bus:
  the emission test times out,
  which is the sender filter described under "What the toolkit listens for after startup".
  Signal emitted before the served value is replaced:
  the emission test reads back the old value at delivery time.
  A `zbus::blocking::Connection::session()` call added to the switch:
  the isolation test sees a connection on the decoy bus before its sentinel.

### Local evidence

Disposable,
not tracked:
`~/temp/agent/live-theme-Z50lLh/evidence/color-scheme-release-pass` holds the screenshots,
`private-bus-monitor.log`,
`slint-seen.log`,
and `decoy-session-bus.log` of the passing run;
`~/temp/agent/live-theme-Z50lLh/results` holds one test log per removed guard.

## Verified workarounds

The runtime command is the supported path;
these are its boundaries.

- Only `dark` and `light` can be served.
  "No preference" (`0`) is not offered at startup or at runtime,
  so `ColorScheme.unknown` cannot be tested through this fixture.
- Only `color-scheme` is served.
  Slint 1.18.1 also watches `accent-color`,
  `font-name`,
  `cursor-blink`,
  and `cursor-blink-time` (`xdg_desktop_settings.rs:71` to `89`);
  those reads return a D-Bus error here and keep toolkit defaults.
- The private service's introspection data does not list the signal,
  because it is emitted with `Connection::emit_signal` rather than declared on the interface.
  Subscribers that use match rules,
  including Slint and `gdbus monitor`,
  are unaffected.
- `Read` returns one variant layer here,
  while the real portal returns two.
  Slint's `downcast_ref` accepts both;
  a client that insists on two layers would not.
- The private bus does not expose unrelated host services such as notifications or file-chooser portals.

## What does not work

- Emitting `SettingChanged` from any connection other than the one owning `org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop`.
  The subscriber silently drops it.
- Sending the integer without a variant wrapper.
  The subscriber silently skips it.
- Treating the toolkit's first reported value as proof that a frame exists.
  Slint applies the startup scheme before its first frame is committed;
  a screenshot taken 400 ms after the first report showed only the compositor's empty screen
  with the release binary.
  `inspect:color-scheme` therefore waits until a screenshot differs from the empty screen.
- Changing the host desktop theme.
  It works but mutates user state.

## Related quirks found while verifying

### `slint-viewer --on` handlers do not run through a shell

`slint-viewer --help` (1.18.1) says the handler "is going to be passed to the shell to be executed".
A handler of `echo $1 >> FILE` instead printed `dark >> FILE` on the viewer's standard output
and created no file.
The source splits the string into words and executes the first one directly:

```rust
// slint-ui/slint tag v1.18.1, tools/viewer/main.rs:603
fn execute_cmd(cmd: &str, callback_args: &[Value]) -> Result<()> {
    let cmd_args = shlex::split(cmd).ok_or("Could not parse the command string")?;
    let program_name = cmd_args.first().ok_or("Missing program name")?;
    let mut command = std::process::Command::new(program_name);
```

Works:
`--on scheme-seen 'echo scheme-seen $1'`,
reading the report from the viewer's standard output.
Fails:
any handler relying on redirection,
pipes,
or variable expansion other than `$1`,
`$2`,
and so on.
The tradeoff of the working form is that reports share the viewer's own standard output.

### The private bus attempts D-Bus activation from host service files

The private `dbus-daemon --session` uses the stock session configuration,
including the host's service directories.
When `slint-viewer` asked for the accessibility bus,
the private daemon logged:

```text
Activating service name='org.a11y.Bus' requested by ':1.6' (... comm="slint-viewer ...")
Activated service 'org.a11y.Bus' failed: Failed to execute program org.a11y.Bus: Permission denied
```

Slint then logged a warning and continued.
Nothing reached the host session bus,
but a hosted client can ask the private daemon to start any service the host has a service file for.
Not changed in this work.
A private configuration file without service directories would close it;
that has not been built or measured.

## Upstream filing decision

`.out-of-scope/` was inspected and has no Slint or xdg-desktop-portal entry.

### Runtime appearance switching

Nothing is filed.
The gap was in this repository's fixture,
which did not serve a changeable value.
Slint,
zbus,
and the portal behaved as their sources and documentation state.

### `slint-viewer --on` help text

1.  Upstream's fault:
    yes.
    The help text promises a shell;
    `tools/viewer/main.rs:603` to `606` execute the program directly.
    The same text and code are on the default branch as of 2026-10-05 (lines `141`,
    `607`,
    and `609`).
2.  Fixable:
    yes,
    by correcting one doc comment or by invoking a shell.
3.  Supported use case:
    yes,
    `--on` is a documented option.
4.  Contribution welcome:
    `CONTRIBUTING.md` says "Please feel welcome to open GitHub issues or pull requests"
    and refers AI coding assistants to `AGENTS.md`.
    No ban on assisted reports was found in `CONTRIBUTING.md` or `AGENTS.md`.
5.  Likely to be fixed:
    no contrary signal.
    `gh search issues --repo slint-ui/slint` for `viewer --on shell`,
    `slint-viewer callback handler shell`,
    and `viewer shlex`,
    and `gh search prs` for `viewer --on handler`,
    returned no results.
6.  Prototype:
    the documentation-only change is written out here.
    It was not compiled,
    because it alters no behavior and building `slint-viewer` from source was outside this work.

```diff

Title: slint-viewer: `--on` help says the handler is passed to the shell, but it is executed directly

Version: slint-viewer 1.18.1 (also present on master as of 2026-10-05).

`slint-viewer --help` documents `--on <callback> <handler>` as
"a string that is going to be passed to the shell to be executed".

`tools/viewer/main.rs` `execute_cmd` splits the string with `shlex::split`
and runs the first word with `std::process::Command::new`, so no shell is involved.

Reproduction:

```sh
slint-viewer --on report 'echo $1 >> /tmp/report.log' scene.slint
```

with a scene that calls `report("dark")`.
Expected from the help text: `/tmp/report.log` contains `dark`.
Actual: `dark >> /tmp/report.log` is printed on the viewer's standard output and no file is created.

Suggested fix: correct the doc comment on the `on` argument to say the command line is split
into words and executed without a shell (or run it through `sh -c` if a shell was intended).

This report was prepared with AI assistance; the reproduction and source reading were checked by running
the installed 1.18.1 binary and reading the tagged source.
