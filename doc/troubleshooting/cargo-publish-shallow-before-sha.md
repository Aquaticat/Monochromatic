# actions/checkout v6.0.2 with `fetch-depth: 2` drops the pre-push head of a multi-generation push, and the cargo-publish detect step read that as a version bump for every crate

## Symptom

Run 37531066191 of `.github/workflows/cargo-publish.yml`,
 the push of `main` from `173e5fe2a` to `533574e1f` on 2026-10-06,
 was meant to publish only `monochromatic-jsonc-edit` 0.1.1.
Every detect job instead decided to publish.
The `detect` job for `forbidden-strings` logged:

```text
BEFORE_SHA: 173e5fe2ab687b48e87bcce31729eba8f01c19cc
before=
after=0.4.1
```

The jobs that followed for crates whose version had not changed then failed:

```text
publish-crate	Publish	error: crate forbidden-strings@0.4.1 already exists on crates.io index
nws-create-release	Create GitHub release with all archives	a release with the same tag name already exists: monochromatic-nested-wayland-session-v0.1.1
create-release	Create GitHub release with all archives	a release with the same tag name already exists: forbidden-strings-v0.4.1
```

What the run changed outside the repository:

- crates.io:
   only the intended upload,
   `monochromatic-jsonc-edit` 0.1.1.
   `forbidden-regex` and `monochromatic-nested-wayland-session` skipped their existing versions,
   and `forbidden-strings` 0.4.1 was refused as a duplicate.
- GitHub releases:
   nothing,
   because the repository's immutable releases refuse an existing tag.
- Build provenance:
   13 attestations for bytes that were never published,
   in addition to the intended one for `monochromatic-jsonc-edit-0.1.1.crate`.
   They cover the rebuilt `forbidden-strings` 0.4.1 archives for all eight targets,
   the rebuilt `monochromatic-nested-wayland-session` 0.1.1 archives for both targets,
   and repackaged `.crate` files of `forbidden-strings` 0.4.1,
   `forbidden-regex` 0.1.1 and `monochromatic-nested-wayland-session` 0.1.1.
   None of the three `.crate` digests equals the checksum crates.io lists for that version,
   so no consumer download can match them.

A cancel of the run was attempted and refused by the session's permission classifier,
 so the jobs ran to completion.

## Root cause

The detect step reads the crate version at `github.event.before` from the checkout.
Before 2026-10-06 it did so only when that commit was already present
 (`.github/workflows/cargo-publish.yml`, `detect` job, as of `533574e1f`):

```bash
before=''
if [ -n "${BEFORE_SHA:-}" ] \
  && [ "$BEFORE_SHA" != '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000' ] \
  && git cat-file -e "${BEFORE_SHA}:${cargo_toml}" 2>/dev/null; then
  before=$(git show "${BEFORE_SHA}:${cargo_toml}" | awk -F'"' '/^version = / { print $2; exit }')
fi
```

An absent commit left `before` empty,
 and an empty `before` differs from any `after`,
 so `publish=true`.
The checkout comment called this degrading gracefully on a first push or a force push.

The checkout is shallow.
`actions/checkout` at the pinned commit `de0fac2e4500dabe0009e67214ff5f5447ce83dd` (tag `v6.0.2`)
 defines the input in `action.yml:74`:

```yaml
  fetch-depth:
    description: 'Number of commits to fetch. 0 indicates all history for all branches and tags.'
    default: 1
```

and the run's checkout issued:

```text
/usr/bin/git -c protocol.version=2 fetch --no-tags --prune --no-recurse-submodules --depth=2 origin +533574e1f10113bff7817f4bb0e2b308790a6d37:refs/remotes/origin/main
```

`--depth=2` fetches the pushed commit and its parents,
 one generation back.
The pushed commit `533574e1f` was a merge whose parents were the branch commit `184ee5baf`
 and the local `main` head `21f2c625d`,
 which carried 16 commits another session had not pushed yet.
The pre-push head `173e5fe2a` was a parent of `184ee5baf`,
 two generations back,
 so it was not in the checkout,
 `git cat-file -e` failed,
 and every crate looked bumped.
A push that moves `main` by exactly one commit never shows this,
 because its `before` is that commit's parent.

The checkout action behaves as documented;
 the defect is the detect step's assumption that `before` is always within reach.

## Verification

Harness:
 the script below,
 saved as `detect-sim.ts` outside the repository,
 builds the same topology in a disposable repository:
 a base commit,
 two commits on local `main`,
 a bump commit in its own worktree,
 and a merge of `main` into it.
It pushes the merge to a local bare repository with `uploadpack.allowReachableSHA1InWant`,
 fetches it with `--depth=2` as the action does,
 and runs each workflow's detect step under `bash` with `BEFORE_SHA` set to the base.
Run it from the repository root,
 after `git show <old commit>:.github/workflows/cargo-publish.yml > cargo-publish.old.yml`,
 as
 `node detect-sim.ts cargo-publish.old.yml .github/workflows/cargo-publish.yml node_modules/.pnpm/yaml@2.9.1/node_modules/yaml/dist/index.js`.
It writes its sandbox under `${HOME}/temp/agent/linter-cutover-20261006/`,
 which must exist.

### Pushes the old detect step handles

- A push of one commit,
   merge or not,
   whose parent is the pre-push head.
- A first push with `before` all zeros,
   which publishes by design.

### Pushes the old detect step misreads

- A push of two or more generations,
   such as a merge whose other parent carries unpushed commits,
   or a plain push of several commits:
   every crate in the workflow is treated as bumped.

## Verified workarounds

The detect steps now fetch the missing commit before reading it:

```bash
before=''
if [ -n "${BEFORE_SHA:-}" ] \
  && [ "$BEFORE_SHA" != '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000' ]; then
  if ! git cat-file -e "${BEFORE_SHA}^{commit}" 2>/dev/null; then
    git fetch --no-tags --depth=1 origin "$BEFORE_SHA"
  fi
  if git cat-file -e "${BEFORE_SHA}:${cargo_toml}" 2>/dev/null; then
    before=$(git show "${BEFORE_SHA}:${cargo_toml}" | awk -F'"' '/^version = / { print $2; exit }')
  fi
fi
```

Tradeoffs:
 one extra fetch of a single commit when a push spans generations;
 a `before` that cannot be fetched,
 for example after a force push that GitHub has already collected,
 now fails the detect job instead of publishing,
 so such a push needs a manual dispatch.
A crate whose manifest did not exist at `before` still counts as bumped,
 which is the first-publication case.

A landing procedure can also avoid the trigger:
 when local `main` holds unpushed commits,
 push it on its own before fast-forwarding it to a merge,
 so each push spans one generation.

## What does not work

- `fetch-depth: 0`:
   fetches all history for a decision that needs one file at one commit,
   and the repository's history is large.
- Comparing against `HEAD^1`:
   for a merge landed by fast-forward the first parent is the branch,
   not the old `main`,
   so a bump made on the branch would be missed.
- A partial clone (`--filter=blob:none`) as a reproduction:
   a missing commit is fetched lazily from the promisor remote,
   so the absence never shows.
   The first attempt at this reproduction made that mistake and reported the base commit as present.

## Upstream filing decision

1. Upstream's fault:
   no.
   `actions/checkout` fetches the documented number of commits;
   the assumption that `before` is within them was this repository's.
2. Upstream can fix it:
   not applicable.
3. Supported use case:
   not applicable.
4. Contribution welcome:
   not checked,
   since nothing is filed.
5. Likely to fix:
   not applicable.
6. Prototyped fix:
   the fix is in this repository's workflow,
   verified by the harness.

`.out-of-scope/` was not consulted because no upstream filing is proposed.
Nothing to file.
