# Claude Code 2.1.289 subagent worktree isolation fails because the `cctt` `WorktreeCreate` hook prints no path

## Status

Diagnosed and fixed on 2026-10-05.
The cause was this repository's hook registration, not a Claude Code defect.
The user chose to remove the registration;
"Fix applied" records the change and what built-in isolation provides afterwards.
"Worktree settings chosen and tested" records the settings that reduce provisioning to one install command.
The manual-worktree section stays for worktrees created by hand.

## Symptom

Launching a subagent with the Agent tool's `isolation: "worktree"` option fails before the agent starts.
Claude Code 2.1.289 returns this error to the calling agent, verbatim:

```text
WorktreeCreate hook failed: hook succeeded but returned no worktree path (command: echo the path to stdout; http/callback: return hookSpecificOutput.worktreePath)
```

Two launches in one session failed identically.
Subagents launched without `isolation` in the same message started normally.
An earlier session hit the same failure and recorded it in `doc/handover/slint-ide-0x.md`.

## Root cause

A command hook registered on `WorktreeCreate` replaces Claude Code's own worktree creation
and must print the new worktree's path.
The Claude Code hooks reference
(fetched 2026-10-05 from `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks.md`) says:

```text
A command hook that creates a worktree must print the worktree's root directory path to stdout.
Claude Code uses this path for subsequent tool calls in that worktree.

If the hook exits with a non-zero code or prints no path, worktree creation fails and Claude Code shows Claude the error.
```

The local settings register the terminal-title hook `cctt` on that event.
`.claude/settings.local.json:764` (the file is ignored, `.gitignore:125`):

```json
    "WorktreeCreate": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "cctt"
          }
```

That registration follows the plugin's own instructions.
`package/claude-code-plugin/terminal-title/README.md:131`:

```json
    "WorktreeCreate": [{ "type": "command", "command": "cctt" }],
```

`cctt` only sets a terminal title for the event and never creates a worktree.
`package/claude-code-plugin/source/src/handler/terminal-title/index.ts:158`:

```ts
  if (hookEvent.hook_event_name === 'WorktreeCreate')
    return `Created worktree: ${hookEvent.name}`;
```

It writes nothing to stdout by design.
`package/claude-code-plugin/source/src/handler/terminal-title/index.ts:198`:

```ts
 Output is `void`: the handler writes its OSC sequence to `/dev/tty` and emits no stdout.
 */
type TerminalTitleOutput = void;
```

So the hook exits 0 with empty stdout,
Claude Code has no path,
and worktree creation fails.

The repository's hook types already state the contract the registration breaks.
`package/claude-code-plugin/hook-type/src/events-misc.ts:136`:

```ts
 Input for `WorktreeCreate` hooks.
 Fires when a worktree is being created.
 Replaces default git worktree behavior when configured.
```

`package/claude-code-plugin/hook-type/src/events-misc.ts:149`:

```ts
/* WorktreeCreate output is the absolute path printed to stdout. No JSON decision model. */
```

### Related observations, not causes

- The fetched reference lists the event's input fields as `worktree_name`,
  `base_path`,
  and `branch`.
  `package/claude-code-plugin/hook-type/src/events-misc.ts:146` declares `name: string` instead,
  and the title handler reads `hookEvent.name`.
  The field names were not probed against a live event in this session.
- `.claude/settings.local.json:774` registers `cctt` on `WorktreeRemove` too.
  The fetched reference says a command hook on that event
  "should delete its directory and exit 0".
  `cctt` deletes nothing.
  Whether that leaves worktrees behind was not tested here,
  because creation never succeeded.

## Verification

Versions:
Claude Code 2.1.289 (`claude --version`),
Node v26.10.0,
repository commit `a21467f5e`.

Harness, run from the repository root.
It feeds `cctt` a `WorktreeCreate` event and measures stdout:

```sh
# doc/troubleshooting/claude-code-worktree-create-hook-no-path.md
printf '%s' '{"session_id":"probe","transcript_path":"/nonexistent/probe.jsonl","cwd":"/var/home/user/Monochromatic","hook_event_name":"WorktreeCreate","name":"probe-worktree"}' \
  | cctt | wc --bytes
```

Result on 2026-10-05:
exit status 0,
0 bytes on stdout,
0 bytes on stderr.

### Works

- Agent tool launches without `isolation`
  (five launched in the diagnosing session).
- `git worktree add -b <branch> .claude/worktrees/<name> main` through the repository's Git wrapper,
  then a package gate run from inside that worktree
  (`GIT_POLICY_NATIVE_IMAGE_TAG=command-parser mise run //package/git-policy/cli:native:test:container`
  passed 9 tests and Clippy in `.claude/worktrees/cli-git-native-command-parser`).

### Fails

- Agent tool launches with `isolation: "worktree"`:
  two of two failed with the quoted error.

## Verified workarounds

### Create the worktree by hand and pin the subagent to it

```sh
# doc/troubleshooting/claude-code-worktree-create-hook-no-path.md
cd -- /var/home/user/Monochromatic && git worktree add -b <branch> .claude/worktrees/<name> main
```

A worktree created from the main checkout receives no ignored state:
`package/git-policy/cli/README.md` documents that main worktrees bypass ignored-state synchronization
"even when they create a linked worktree".
The first commit in the new worktree therefore failed with this policy event, verbatim:

```text
{"schemaVersion":1,"sequence":0,"type":"engine-failure","code":"plugin-threw","message":"Forbidden-strings scanner executable could not be started.","trigger":"pre-forward","policyId":"security/forbidden-strings"}
```

Provision the worktree before the subagent's first commit:

```sh
# doc/troubleshooting/claude-code-worktree-create-hook-no-path.md
mkdir --parents .claude/worktrees/<name>/package/cli/forbidden-strings/target/release
cp --reflink=auto --preserve=mode package/cli/forbidden-strings/target/release/forbidden-strings \
  .claude/worktrees/<name>/package/cli/forbidden-strings/target/release/forbidden-strings
cd -- /var/home/user/Monochromatic/.claude/worktrees/<name> && mise run prepare:pnpm:install
```

After that the same commit succeeded and auto-push published the branch.
`prepare:pnpm:install` took 1.5 seconds against the warm store and changed no tracked file.

Then launch the subagent without `isolation` and tell it the worktree root and branch.

Tradeoffs:

- The copied scanner is the main checkout's build as of the copy,
  not a build of the worktree's own scanner source.
- A subagent starts in the parent session's current shell directory,
  not the repository root.
  On 2026-10-05 a subagent briefed for the main checkout reported that its environment named
  `.claude/worktrees/integrate-linter`,
  because the parent's last command had run there;
  it followed its brief's absolute paths and worked in the main checkout.
  Return the parent's shell to the intended directory before launching,
  and give every brief absolute paths.

- The subagent's session still starts in the main checkout.
  It must pin every shell command to the worktree and use absolute paths under it;
  a path into the main checkout silently edits the wrong tree.
- Nothing removes the worktree or its branch when the subagent finishes.
- Auto-push publishes the branch.
- `.claude/` is ignored,
  so the worktree does not appear in the main checkout's status;
  it also means nothing reminds a later session that it exists.
  `git worktree list` shows it.

## What does not work

- Retrying the isolated launch:
  the hook is deterministic,
  so the second attempt failed the same way.
- Expecting `cctt` to pass the event through to Claude Code's default behavior:
  a registered command hook replaces the default,
  it does not decorate it.

## Fix applied

On 2026-10-05 the user chose removal over teaching the hook to create worktrees
(that alternative would move worktree location, branch naming and setup into a title plugin).

- The `WorktreeCreate` entry is removed from `.claude/settings.local.json`;
  a comparison against a backup showed no other difference.
- `package/claude-code-plugin/terminal-title/README.md` no longer lists `WorktreeCreate` in its event examples
  or its settings example,
  and says why it must stay unregistered (commit `495f36355`).
- The title handler still has its `WorktreeCreate` branch;
  it is unreachable while the event is unregistered.

Verified in the same session, without restarting Claude Code:
an Agent launch with `isolation: "worktree"` started,
which had failed twice before the change.
A read-only probe inside it reported:

- root `.claude/worktrees/agent-<id>` on branch `worktree-agent-<id>`;
- `HEAD` at `origin/main` (`aa5f9d2bc`) while local `main` was at `8cd4e9721`,
  so unpushed local commits are absent from an isolated worktree;
- no `node_modules` and no `package/cli/forbidden-strings/target/release/forbidden-strings`,
  so its first commit would hit the scanner failure described under "Verified workarounds" until provisioned;
- a clean status: the main checkout's uncommitted files are not carried over.

After the probe returned, the worktree directory and its branch were gone.
`cctt` is still registered on `WorktreeRemove`,
so a non-deleting hook there did not prevent removal of an unchanged worktree.
Removal of a worktree that has commits was not tested.

## Worktree settings chosen and tested

On 2026-10-05 the user chose to set both Claude Code `worktree` settings and test them.
`.claude/settings.local.json` now holds:

```jsonc
// .claude/settings.local.json
  "worktree": {
    "baseRef": "head",
    "symlinkDirectories": [
      "package/cli/forbidden-strings/target"
    ]
  }
```

With these settings an isolated agent needs one command before its first commit:
`mise run prepare:pnpm:install`,
run from its worktree root.

Two probes tested the settings.
Each was an isolated agent that inspected its worktree and tried one throwaway commit:
the first with `node_modules` also listed in `symlinkDirectories`,
the second with the settings shown here.
Times are local (UTC-4).

### `baseRef: "head"` starts from the local checkout

The second probe's worktree was created at 15:33 with `HEAD` at `1d7bc0fe7`.
`git reflog show main` has local `main` at `1d7bc0fe7` from 15:32:36 to 15:34:07.
`git reflog show origin/main` has the remote-tracking ref at `a9010f435` from 15:32:22 to 15:34:12.
So the worktree started from the local checkout, not from `origin/main`.
Before the setting,
the read-only probe under "Fix applied" had started from `origin/main`.

### A symlinked root `node_modules` fails and is unsafe

The first probe ran with `node_modules` and `package/cli/forbidden-strings/target` both listed.
Both appeared in the worktree as symbolic links into the main checkout,
and the scanner executable resolved through its link.
The first commit still failed in the `git add` step with a policy event.
The wrapper truncated the message,
which reads in part:

```text
"type":"engine-failure","code":"plugin-threw"
markdown-lint report could not be parsed
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find package '@monochromatic-dev
"trigger":"pre-forward","policyId":"markdown/autofix"
```

Which package was missing was not isolated,
because the event is truncated
and the probe's check for per-package `node_modules` directories did not run
(see "The refusal that blocked one probe step").

A root link is also wrong when it does resolve.
Workspace packages are relative links inside the root directory:
`readlink node_modules/@monochromatic-dev/git-policy-cli` prints `../../package/git-policy/cli`.
Through a linked root `node_modules` that path resolves against the main checkout,
so an isolated agent would import the main checkout's package sources instead of its own.
`node_modules` was therefore removed from `symlinkDirectories`.

### Linking only the scanner's `target` works after an install

The second probe ran with the settings shown under "Worktree settings chosen and tested".

- `node_modules` did not exist;
  `package/cli/forbidden-strings/target` was a link into the main checkout.
- `mise run prepare:pnpm:install` succeeded with no trust prompt in 15.5 seconds
  (pnpm reported 13.3 seconds).
  It reused 604 packages from the content-addressable store,
  downloaded none,
  and put the virtual store inside the worktree.
- `git add` and `git commit` of one new Markdown file then succeeded with no policy event,
  and auto-push published the branch `worktree-agent-<id>`.

### Side effects

- The link is untracked and not ignored:
  `git status --short` prints `?? package/cli/forbidden-strings/target`.
  `.gitignore:54` is `target/`,
  and the `gitignore` manual says a pattern `foo/`
  "will not match a regular file or a symbolic link foo".
  Explicit pathspecs are unaffected.
- The scanner's `target` is shared.
  A scanner build inside an isolated worktree writes into the main checkout's directory,
  and every worktree's commit policy runs whichever executable was built last.
- A worktree with changes is kept.
  The Agent tool describes isolated worktrees as "auto-cleaned if unchanged";
  the read-only probe's worktree and branch were removed,
  and both probes that created files were left in place for the caller.
- Auto-push publishes the agent's branch,
  so cleanup has a remote step.

Cleanup order used for the second probe, from the main checkout:

```sh
# doc/troubleshooting/claude-code-worktree-create-hook-no-path.md
unlink .claude/worktrees/agent-<id>/package/cli/forbidden-strings/target
git worktree remove .claude/worktrees/agent-<id>
git branch --delete --force worktree-agent-<id>
git push origin --delete worktree-agent-<id>
```

The link was removed first so that `git worktree remove` needed no `--force`
and never walked into the shared directory;
removal with the link still present was not tried.
The scanner executable in the main checkout was still present afterwards.

### The refusal that blocked one probe step

In the first probe,
`ls -d package/git-policy/cli/node_modules package/cli/mvm/node_modules 2>&1` was refused before it ran:

```text
This agent is isolated in the worktree /var/home/user/Monochromatic/.claude/worktrees/agent-a096a5b013ff39b97, but this command feeds node text naming git in a plain command, which cannot be shown to stay inside the worktree. Refusing to run it — a worktree-isolated agent's git operations must target its own worktree. Run the plain command from /var/home/user/Monochromatic/.claude/worktrees/agent-a096a5b013ff39b97.
```

The command was already running from that worktree root and names no Git operation;
its paths contain `git-policy` and `node_modules`.
The text does not occur under `package/`,
`.claude/` or `doc/` in this repository,
so the emitter was not identified;
user-level hooks and Claude Code itself were not searched.

## Upstream filing decision

`.out-of-scope/claude-code-upstream-bugs.md` exempts Claude Code defects from upstream tracking.
It does not decide this case,
because this is not an upstream defect.

1.  Is it upstream's fault?
    No.
    Claude Code behaves as its reference documents;
    the repository registers a hook that cannot satisfy the event's contract.
2.  Can upstream fix it?
    Not applicable.
3.  Is the use case supported?
    Not applicable.
4.  Would the repository welcome a contribution?
    Not applicable.
5.  Would they likely fix it?
    Not applicable.
6.  Is a minimal fix prototyped?
    Not applicable upstream;
    the local fix is in "Fix applied".

Decision:
nothing to file upstream,
and no draft is kept.
The upstream tracker was not searched,
because constraint 1 fails on the repository's own source.
