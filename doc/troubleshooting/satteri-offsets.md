# Sätteri 0.9.4 reports mdast `position` offsets in the wrong units (byte offsets from plugin visitors, code-point offsets from materialized trees), not remark's UTF-16 code units

Sätteri (<https://satteri.bruits.org/>,
 npm `satteri@0.9.4`,
 git `bruits/satteri`
at commit `15b0f8574`) exposes standard mdast nodes whose `position.start.offset`
/ `position.end.offset` do not match the UTF-16 code-unit indices that
remark/micromark (and JavaScript string indexing) use.
 Two distinct code paths
get it wrong in two different ways.
 Any consumer that slices the source at those
offsets,
 or writes edits at them,
 corrupts output on documents containing
multibyte or astral (emoji) characters.

This was found while evaluating a migration of the repo's Markdown linter
(`package/cli/markdown-lint`) from `mdast-util-from-markdown` to Sätteri.
 The
linter recovers exact written forms and applies fixes at node offsets,
 so wrong
offsets misplace slices and edits.

## Symptom

Two bugs,
 same theme (offset unit mismatch),
 different paths:

- Bug A,
   plugin/visitor path:
   nodes handed to an MDAST visitor (via the manual
  `visitMdastHandle` pipeline,
   and via `markdownToHtml` / `mdxToJs` mdast
  plugins) carry `position.*.offset` as UTF-8 **byte** offsets.
   On a document
  with 8 em-dashes before a node,
   `markdownToMdast` places that node at char
  offset 1842 while the visitor sees offset 1858 (its 16 extra bytes).
   Every
  `source.slice(node.position.start.offset, node.position.end.offset)` and every
  edit offset is shifted by (bytes minus UTF-16 units) of all preceding
  non-ASCII text.
- Bug B,
   materialized path:
   `markdownToMdast` / `markdownToHast` report
  `position.*.offset` as Unicode **code-point** offsets.
   These are correct for
  BMP characters (em-dash `—` U+2014,
   CJK,
   accents) but wrong for astral
  characters (emoji,
   U+1F680 `🚀`,
   math alphanumerics),
   which are one code point
  but two UTF-16 code units.
   A node the parser correctly gives
  `value: "3.1.1 "` slices to `"1. 3.1"` when three emoji precede it,
   because
  its stored offset is 3 short.

There is no thrown error in either case;
 the failure is silent corruption.
 A
downstream symptom seen in the linter:
 an autofix that converts a Markdown pipe
table to an HTML `<table>` slices table cells at the byte-shifted offsets
(Bug A),
 producing malformed HTML that Sätteri's MDX parser then rejects on
re-parse with `Expected the closing tag </table> ... (mdx-jsx:unexpected-character)`.
The clean HTML that a correct slice would produce parses fine,
 so that crash is
a consequence of Bug A,
 not a separate MDX defect.

## Root cause

The arena stores raw UTF-8 byte offsets per node.
 remark's `position.*.offset`
is a UTF-16 code-unit index into the JS source string (confirmed below).
 Sätteri
never converts to UTF-16:
 the materialized path converts to code points (close,
but wrong on astral chars),
 and the walk path does not convert at all.

The wrong premise is stated in the source.
 `crates/satteri-arena/src/line_index.rs:5`:

```rust
/// Columns and offsets are counted as Unicode code points (matching the
/// CommonMark `position` convention used by remark/micromark), not bytes —
```

remark does not use code points;
 it uses UTF-16 code units.
 The counter that
implements this premise,
 `crates/satteri-arena/src/line_index.rs:152`:

```rust
fn code_point_count_bytes(bytes: &[u8]) -> u32 {
    let mut count: u32 = 0;
    for &b in bytes {
        if (b & 0xC0) != 0x80 {   // count every non-continuation byte = one code point
            count += 1;
        }
    }
    count
}
```

A 4-byte UTF-8 sequence (an astral scalar value) is counted as one,
 but it is
two UTF-16 code units.
 This drives both `byte_to_cp_offset`
(`line_index.rs:113`) and the per-line `line_cp_offsets`,
 so Bug B is every
offset past an astral character.

Bug B path (materialized).
 `crates/satteri-arena/src/raw_buffer.rs:74` and
`:107`-`117` build a `LineIndex` and rewrite each node's stored byte offset to a
code-point offset before serializing the wire buffer JS materializes:

```rust
// raw_buffer.rs:74
// The arena tracks `start_offset`/`end_offset` as **byte** offsets
// raw_buffer.rs:107,116-117
let line_index = LineIndex::from_source(&self.string_pool);
// ...
let cp_start = cursor.byte_to_cp_offset(node.start_offset);
let cp_end = cursor.byte_to_cp_offset(node.end_offset);
```

Bug A path (plugin/visitor).
 `crates/satteri-ast/src/walk.rs:208`-`209`
`write_walk_prelude` emits the arena's raw byte offsets with no conversion at all:

```rust
// Position (always present)
out.extend_from_slice(&node.start_offset.to_le_bytes());
out.extend_from_slice(&node.end_offset.to_le_bytes());
```

So the walk path is even further off than the materialized path:
 raw bytes
rather than code points.
 The same `write_walk_prelude` feeds both the manual
`visitMdastHandle` pipeline and the mdast-plugin stage of `markdownToHtml`,
 so
the whole plugin API is affected,
 not just the low-level pipeline.

Earlier hypotheses that were wrong,
 recorded so the next investigator does not
repeat them:

- "The divergence is a list-marker parse difference."
   The minimal input
  `1. 3.1.1 **Testing**` parses identically in Sätteri and mdast-util (marker
  consumed,
   `text: "3.1.1 "`).
   The real cause is Bug B:
   the affected file
  (`package/webapp-productivity/rss/TODO.index.md`) contains emoji,
   and the
  node's `value` is correct (`"3.1.1 "`) while its `position` offset is 3 short
  (three emoji precede it).
   Value-versus-slice mismatch,
   not a parse difference.
- "The materialized path is correct;
   only the visitor path is buggy."
   False:
  the materialized path is correct only for BMP text.
   It is wrong on astral
  characters (Bug B).
   The em-dash corpus file misled the first reading because
  `—` is BMP,
   so code point equals UTF-16 there.

## Verification

Version under test:
 npm `satteri@0.9.4` (native `satteri-linux-x64-gnu`),
 git
source `bruits/satteri@15b0f8574`.
 Reference parser:
 `mdast-util-from-markdown`
2.0.3 with `micromark-extension-gfm`.

Reference behavior (remark uses UTF-16,
 for both offset and column).
 A link
after one astral emoji:

```js
// node --input-type=module
import { fromMarkdown } from 'mdast-util-from-markdown';
const md = 'a🪐b [x](http://e.com)\n';
const tree = fromMarkdown(md);
let link; (function w(n){ if (n.type === 'link') link = n; for (const c of n.children ?? []) w(c); })(tree);
console.log(link.position.start.offset, link.position.start.column);
// 5 6   -> UTF-16 index/column of "[x]"; code-point index/column would be 4 5
```

Bug B (materialized,
 code-point offsets).
 Value is right,
 slice is wrong:

```js
import { markdownToMdast } from 'satteri';
const md = '🎯 x\n\n- item, with a break. done.\n';
const t = markdownToMdast(md);
let n; (function w(x){ if (x.type === 'text' && x.value.includes('item')) n = x; for (const c of x.children ?? []) w(c); })(t);
console.log(JSON.stringify(n.value));                                   // "item, with a break. done."
console.log(JSON.stringify(md.slice(n.position.start.offset, n.position.end.offset)));
// " item, with a break. done"  -> off by one (one astral char before it)
```

Bug A (visitor,
 byte offsets).
 The same tree via the manual pipeline is off by
the byte-minus-UTF-16 delta of all preceding non-ASCII:

```js
import { createMdastHandle, dropHandle, visitMdastHandle, resolveMdastSubscriptions, markdownToMdast } from 'satteri';
const md = '— — — — — — — — `code` and then text, here.\n'; // 8 em-dashes, then a 2nd text node
const visitors = { text(node){ if (node.value.includes('and then')) console.log('visitor offset', node.position.start.offset); } };
const subs = resolveMdastSubscriptions(visitors);
const h = createMdastHandle(md);
visitMdastHandle(h, visitors, subs, md, undefined, {}, 'markdown');
dropHandle(h);
// visitor offset 38   (byte). markdownToMdast reports 22 (code-point/UTF-16, they coincide here since — is BMP).
```

Patterns that work cleanly (no astral chars,
 no non-ASCII before the node):

- Pure ASCII documents:
   all offsets correct in both paths.
- BMP-only non-ASCII (em-dash,
   accents,
   CJK,
   `ὐ`) via the materialized path:
  correct,
   because code point equals UTF-16 unit for BMP.

Patterns that fail:

- Bug A (byte offsets):
   any document with non-ASCII text before a node,
   read
  through `visitMdastHandle` or a `markdownToHtml` mdast plugin.
- Bug B (code-point offsets):
   any document with astral characters (emoji,
   etc.)
  before a node,
   read through `markdownToMdast` / `markdownToHast`.

## Verified workarounds

Consumer-side,
 at our boundary (Sätteri is third-party;
 its clone is not edited
for a local fix).
 Both correct offsets back to UTF-16 before any slice or edit.

- For the materialized path (Bug B),
   used by the linter's parser swap:
   after
  `markdownToMdast`,
   when the source contains any astral character,
   build a
  code-point-index to UTF-16-index map by scanning the source once,
   then walk
  the tree and rewrite every `position.start.offset` / `position.end.offset`.
  BMP-only sources (`source.length === [...source].length`) need no correction,
  so the common case is a single length comparison.
   Tradeoff:
   one extra O(n)
  source scan plus one O(nodes) tree walk,
   but only on astral-bearing files;
  it does not fix columns (left as code points),
   which the linter does not use
  for edits.
- For the visitor path (Bug A):
   do not use it for any offset-based work.
   The
  byte offsets cannot be corrected as cheaply (they need a full byte-to-UTF-16
  map),
   and slicing the source at them is wrong for all non-ASCII,
   not just
  astral.
   Prefer the materialized path plus the Bug B correction.
   This is why
  the linter migration adopts the parser swap (materialized) and not the plugin
  rewrite (visitor);
   see `doc/handover/markdown-lint-satteri-benchmark.md`.

## What does not work

- Trusting the materialized path unconditionally.
   It is correct for BMP text,
  which hides Bug B until an emoji appears;
   the repo's docs contain emoji.
- Converting the visitor's byte offsets by counting code points.
   That reaches
  the materialized path's behavior,
   which is still wrong on astral characters.
  The only correct unit is UTF-16 code units.
- Using Sätteri's `position.*.column` as a stand-in.
   Columns are computed with
  the same code-point counter and are equally wrong on astral characters.

## Upstream filing decision

`.out-of-scope/` was checked:
 `claude-code-upstream-bugs.md` is specific to
Claude Code and does not exempt Sätteri,
 so upstream tracking is in scope.

Duplicate search:
 `gh issue list --repo bruits/satteri --state all` and
`gh search issues` for offset/position/utf terms.
 No existing issue covers the
offset unit.
 The nearest threads are unrelated:
 #87 (diagnostics not surfaced),
#94 (range API),
 #124 (`ctx.source` duplication).
 No duplicate;
 a new issue is
appropriate.

Six-constraint check:

1. Upstream's fault?
    Yes.
    Sätteri emits offsets in byte or code-point units
   where the ecosystem it targets uses UTF-16 code units.
2. Can upstream fix it?
    Yes,
    and prototyped below.
    Not architectural:
    a counter
   change plus one conversion at the walk site.
3. Supporting this use case?
    Yes.
    Standard mdast `position` compatible with
   remark/micromark is a stated goal,
    asserted in `line_index.rs:5-8`.
4. Would the repo welcome it?
    Yes.
    `CONTRIBUTING.md` invites issues and PRs and
   ships a bug-report template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/01-bug-report.yml`);
    no
   ban on AI-assisted reports was found (`AGENTS.md` treats agents and humans
   equally and asks for a Sampo changeset on fixes).
    The draft discloses AI
   assistance accordingly.
5. Will they likely fix it?
    No signal against.
    Correctness is a stated value
   ("fast,
    correct,
    and extensible",
    `CONTRIBUTING.md`);
    the tracker is active;
   no won't-fix on positions.
6. Prototyped a minimal fix?
    Yes,
    verified.
    See below and `satteri-offsets.patch`.

Prototype (Bug B core,
 verified).
 In a fresh disposable clone
(`bruits/satteri@15b0f8574`),
 change the counter to count UTF-16 code units
(a 4-byte sequence adds two),
 which flows through `byte_to_cp_offset` and
`line_cp_offsets`.
 Full diff in `satteri-offsets.patch` (this directory).
The essential hunk:

```rust
// crates/satteri-arena/src/line_index.rs, code_point_count_bytes -> utf16_unit_count_bytes
if (b & 0xC0) != 0x80 {
    count += 1;
    if b >= 0xF0 {   // 4-byte UTF-8 = astral scalar = surrogate pair = 2 UTF-16 units
        count += 1;
    }
}
```

Verification with the crate's own harness (light:
 `satteri-arena` depends only
on `memchr` and `rustc-hash`),
 asserting the `b` after `🪐` lands at UTF-16
offset 2 and column 3:

```text
$ cargo test -p satteri-arena --lib astral_offset_and_column_are_utf16
# pre-patch:  assertion `left == right` failed  left: 1  right: 2   (code-point counting)
# post-patch: test result: ok. 20 passed; 0 failed
```

Bug A (walk site) uses the same corrected conversion.
 `walk.rs:208-209` must
mirror the materialized path (`raw_buffer.rs:107,116-117`):
 build a
`LineIndex::from_source` cursor once at the walk entry and emit
`cursor.byte_to_cp_offset(node.start_offset)` / `...end_offset` instead of the
raw fields.
 This half is described,
 not compiled,
 because verifying it end to
end needs a full napi rebuild;
 the offset-unit core it depends on is proven by
the cargo test above.

All six constraints hold,
 so the draft below is fileable as-is (it is not marked
"do not file").
 Filing itself is left to a maintainer of this repo;
 this is the
record.

Title: `position` offsets use the wrong unit: byte offsets from plugin visitors, code-point offsets from materialized trees (should be UTF-16 code units)

Labels: bug, parser, plugin api

### Summary

`position.start.offset` / `position.end.offset` on mdast nodes do not match the
UTF-16 code-unit offsets remark/micromark report (indices into the JS source
string). Two paths are wrong in two ways:

- Materialized (`markdownToMdast` / `markdownToHast`): code-point offsets.
  Correct for BMP, off by the astral-character count for emoji and other
  supplementary-plane characters.
- Plugin/visitor (`visitMdastHandle`, and `markdownToHtml` / `mdxToJs` mdast
  plugins): raw UTF-8 byte offsets, off for all non-ASCII text.

Any consumer slicing the source or writing edits at these offsets corrupts
output on non-ASCII / emoji documents.

### Reproduction

Materialized, code-point offsets (off by one astral char):

```js
import { markdownToMdast } from 'satteri';
const md = '🎯 x\n\n- item, with a break. done.\n';
const t = markdownToMdast(md);
let n; (function w(x){ if (x.type==='text' && x.value.includes('item')) n=x; for (const c of x.children ?? []) w(c); })(t);
// n.value === "item, with a break. done." but
// md.slice(n.position.start.offset, n.position.end.offset) === " item, with a break. done"
```

Visitor, byte offsets (off by preceding non-ASCII byte delta):

```js
import { createMdastHandle, dropHandle, visitMdastHandle, resolveMdastSubscriptions } from 'satteri';
const md = '— — — — — — — — `code` and then text.\n';
const visitors = { text(n){ if (n.value.includes('and then')) console.log(n.position.start.offset); } };
const subs = resolveMdastSubscriptions(visitors);
const h = createMdastHandle(md);
visitMdastHandle(h, visitors, subs, md, undefined, {}, 'markdown'); // logs 38 (byte); should be 22
dropHandle(h);
```

remark reports UTF-16 (reference):

```js
import { fromMarkdown } from 'mdast-util-from-markdown';
const t = fromMarkdown('a🪐b [x](http://e.com)\n'); // link offset 5, column 6 (UTF-16), not 4/5 (code point)
```

### Root cause

The arena stores byte offsets. `crates/satteri-arena/src/line_index.rs`
converts to code points, not UTF-16 code units (`code_point_count_bytes`
counts one per scalar value; a 4-byte sequence is two UTF-16 units). The
premise in the doc comment ("counted as Unicode code points ... used by
remark/micromark") is the error: remark uses UTF-16.

- Materialized path converts via `raw_buffer.rs` (`byte_to_cp_offset`), so it
  is code-point-based.
- `crates/satteri-ast/src/walk.rs:208-209` (`write_walk_prelude`) emits the raw
  byte `start_offset`/`end_offset` with no conversion at all.

### Suggested fix

Count UTF-16 code units instead of code points in
`crates/satteri-arena/src/line_index.rs` (a 4-byte lead byte adds two), which
corrects `byte_to_cp_offset`, `line_cp_offsets`, and the column counter. Then
apply that conversion at the walk site
(`crates/satteri-ast/src/walk.rs:208-209`) as the materialized path already
does (`raw_buffer.rs:107,116-117`). A verified crate-level diff for the counter
(with a pre/post test) is available.

Note: this report was prepared with AI assistance; the reproductions, the
source trace, and the counter fix were verified against
`satteri@0.9.4` and `bruits/satteri@15b0f8574` (`cargo test -p satteri-arena`).
