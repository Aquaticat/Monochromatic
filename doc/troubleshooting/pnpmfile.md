# pnpm's pnpmfile loader recognises only `.cjs` and `.mjs`, so `.pnpmfile.ts` is not loadable; `.mts` fails on two independent grounds

This file records the constraint that forces the repo's
dependency blocklist hook to live at `.pnpmfile.mjs` with JSDoc
types rather than `.pnpmfile.ts` with native TypeScript.
 Source
citations against `pnpm/pnpm` HEAD (clone in
`/tmp/pnpm-investigate`).

## Symptom

A reasonable assumption:
 pnpm loads any sensible source file
that defines hooks,
 so `.pnpmfile.ts` or `.pnpmfile.mts`
should work like `.pnpmfile.cjs` and `.pnpmfile.mjs`.

Reality:
 `.pnpmfile.ts` is silently ignored (pnpm reports no
pnpmfile found).
 `.pnpmfile.mts` fails on two independent
grounds (see Root cause).
 Only `.cjs` and `.mjs` are
auto-discovered;
 `.cts` is loadable only via the explicit
`--pnpmfile` flag with the right Node options.

## Root cause

pnpm's pnpmfile loader recognises exactly two extensions:
`.cjs` (loaded via `require()`) and `.mjs` (loaded via dynamic
`import()`).
 No `.ts`,
 `.mts`,
 `.cts`,
 or `.js` path exists.
The loader ships no transpiler.

### Loader branch

`hooks/pnpmfile/src/requirePnpmfile.ts`,
 lines 46-56:

```ts
export async function requirePnpmfile (pnpmFilePath: string, prefix: string): ... {
  try {
    let pnpmfile: Pnpmfile
    // Check if it's an ESM module (ends with .mjs)
    if (pnpmFilePath.endsWith('.mjs')) {
      const url = pathToFileURL(path.resolve(pnpmFilePath)).href
      pnpmfile = await import(url)
    } else {
      // Use require for CommonJS modules
      pnpmfile = require(pnpmFilePath)
    }
```

The check is a literal `endsWith('.mjs')`,
 not "extension
contains `m`".
 Anything that does not end in `.mjs` takes the
`require()` branch.

### Existence check

Same file,
 lines 110-115:

```ts
function pnpmFileExistsSync(pnpmFilePath: string,): boolean {
  const pnpmFileRealName =
    pnpmFilePath.endsWith('.cjs',) || pnpmFilePath.endsWith('.mjs',)
      ? pnpmFilePath
      : `${pnpmFilePath}.cjs`;
  return fs.existsSync(pnpmFileRealName,);
}
```

Any explicit `--pnpmfile <path>` argument that does not already
end in `.cjs` or `.mjs` gets `.cjs` appended for the existence
check.
 No `.ts`/`.mts`/`.cts`/`.js` enumeration anywhere.

### Auto-discovery order

`hooks/pnpmfile/src/requireHooks.ts`,
 lines 71-91:
 default mode
tries `.pnpmfile.mjs` first,
 then falls back to
`.pnpmfile.cjs`.
 ESM support was added in
[pnpm/pnpm#9730](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/9730),
commit `e146e988ea`.

### Why `.mts` fails on two grounds

1. The loader sends anything not ending in `.mjs` through
   `require()`.
    `.mts` is always ESM;
    pnpm's CJS-context
   `require('.pnpmfile.mts')` will not resolve a bare `.mts`
   even with `--experimental-require-module
   --experimental-strip-types`.
2. `pnpmFileExistsSync` produces `.pnpmfile.mts.cjs` and finds
   nothing,
    so the explicit-flag path also fails.

Patching `.mts` support requires editing both the loader
branch and the existence check upstream.

## Verification

Versions under test:

- pnpm HEAD (cloned into `/tmp/pnpm-investigate` for the
  citations).
- Repo file using the constraint:
   `.pnpmfile.mjs`.
- Policy doc:
   `doc/dependency-blocklist.md`.

Loadability matrix (verified against HEAD):

- Auto-discovered:
   `.pnpmfile.mjs` (ESM branch),
  `.pnpmfile.cjs` (CJS branch).
- Loadable only via explicit `--pnpmfile <path>`:
   `.cts` on
  Node 23+ with `NODE_OPTIONS='--experimental-strip-types'`;
  goes through `require()`,
   which the type-stripper extends to
  `.cts`.
- Not loadable at all:
   `.mts`,
   `.ts`,
   `.js` (per the citations
  above).

## Maintainer rationale

Issue [pnpm/pnpm#2728](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/2728),
"Support typescript version of pnpmfile (pnpmfile.
ts)",
 open
since 2020-07-29.
 Zoltan Kochan (lead maintainer) replied
once:

> Only if it doesn't require us to ship typescript with pnpm.

No subsequent maintainer comment,
 no implementation PR ever
filed (`gh search prs --repo pnpm/pnpm "pnpmfile.ts"` returns
empty).
 The constraint is operational (binary size,
 dependency
surface),
 not fundamental.

## Industry comparison

Neither Yarn Berry nor npm load TypeScript natively at hook
runtime:

- Yarn Berry plugins are pre-bundled JS produced by the Yarn
  builder;
   plugin TS is compiled at plugin-build time,
   not at
  hook-runtime.
- npm has no in-process hook file;
   lifecycle scripts are
  shell-invoked binaries.

pnpm's `.cjs`/`.mjs`-only loader matches the wider ecosystem.

## Verified workarounds

### `.pnpmfile.mjs` with JSDoc types (this repo's choice)

Use `.pnpmfile.mjs` and annotate with JSDoc:

```js
/** @satisfies {import('@pnpm/pnpmfile/lib/Hooks').Hooks} */
export const hooks = {
  readPackage(pkg,) {
    return applyBlocklist({ pkg, },);
  },
};
```

The `satisfies` check catches hook-signature drift if pnpm
changes the `Hooks` shape upstream,
 with zero build pipeline.

Tradeoff:
 types live in JSDoc rather than native TS syntax.
The hook file is small (around 150 lines) and rarely touched;
the cost is small.
 The policy data itself was moved out to
`.pnpmfile.policies.json` (imported via a `with { type: 'json' }`
attribute),
 so the churn-prone blocklist no longer lives in the
JSDoc-typed hook at all;
 only the `Policy` typedef and the hook
logic remain.

### Native type stripping (Node 23+; rejected)

```bash
NODE_OPTIONS='--experimental-strip-types' pnpm --pnpmfile .pnpmfile.cts install
```

Works for `.cts` because `require()` with type stripping
handles it.
 Tradeoff:
 every developer (and CI) must remember
the env var and the explicit `--pnpmfile` argument.
 Brittle.

### Pre-strip via file-enforcer + ts-blank-space (considered, rejected)

Pattern would mirror `file-enforcer.config.ts`'s `CLAUDE.md`
and `mise.toml` generators:
 write `.pnpmfile.ts` as source of
truth,
 run `ts-blank-space` to emit `.pnpmfile.mjs`,
 commit
the generated artifact,
 add a CI drift check.

```ts
import tsBlankSpace from 'ts-blank-space';

async function generatePnpmfile(): Promise<void> {
  const tsSource = await cat(['./.pnpmfile.ts',],);
  await overwrite(
    './.pnpmfile.mjs',
    `// Generated from .pnpmfile.ts by file-enforcer.
${tsBlankSpace(tsSource,)}`,
  );
}
```

Tradeoff:
 adds a new dev dependency,
 a new file-enforcer
generator,
 a committed generated artifact,
 a CI drift check,
and a two-file mental model on every edit,
 in exchange for
cosmetic improvements (cleaner type syntax) on a small file
touched rarely.

The blocklist data did outgrow a single inline table,
 but the
chosen split was the lighter one:
 the policy entries moved to a
plain `.pnpmfile.policies.json` the hook imports,
 not a TS
source run through `ts-blank-space`.
 JSON data needs no
transpiler,
 so it sidesteps every cost above.
 The TS-strip
generator stays rejected;
 revisit only if the hook logic (not
the data) needs shared TS types from elsewhere.

## Checksum scope: the hash covers the pnpmfile only, not its imports

pnpm stores a `pnpmfileChecksum` line in `pnpm-lock.yaml` and
re-runs resolution when it changes.
 The checksum is the hash of
the discovered pnpmfile's own bytes,
 not of any module the
pnpmfile imports.

Source trace against the installed pnpm (v11.5.1,
`dist/pnpm.mjs`):

- `calculatePnpmfileChecksum` builds `filesToIncludeInHash` from
  the `entries` whose `includeInChecksum` is true,
   sorts them,
  and calls `createHashFromMultipleFiles` (line 167983).
   Only the
  auto-discovered `.pnpmfile.mjs` / `.pnpmfile.cjs` and explicit
  `--pnpmfile` paths are pushed into `entries` with
  `includeInChecksum: true`;
   nothing those files `import` is
  added.
- `createHashFromMultipleFiles` -> `createHashFromFile` ->
  `readNormalizedFile` reads each listed file's text with
  `fs.readFile(file, 'utf8')` and hashes the bytes (line 61622).

Consequence for this repo's split:
 the policy data lives in
`.pnpmfile.policies.json`,
 imported by `.pnpmfile.mjs`.
 Editing
the JSON alone leaves `.pnpmfile.mjs`'s bytes unchanged,
 so the
checksum does not move and pnpm may reuse the cached resolution.
After a data-only blocklist edit,
 force re-resolution with
`pnpm install --force` (or touch `.pnpmfile.mjs`).
 Editing
`.pnpmfile.mjs` itself (as the data-to-JSON refactor did) does
bump the checksum and re-resolves automatically;
 verified by the
lockfile diff showing only the `pnpmfileChecksum` line changed.

## What does not work

- Renaming to `.pnpmfile.ts`:
   silently ignored by
  auto-discovery;
   `--pnpmfile .pnpmfile.ts` appends `.cjs` and
  fails the existence check.
- Renaming to `.pnpmfile.mts`:
   fails on both the loader branch
  (`require` cannot load bare `.mts`) and the existence check
  (produces `.pnpmfile.mts.cjs`).
- Setting `--pnpmfile .pnpmfile.js`:
   takes the `require()`
  branch but pnpm's package context is CJS,
   so ESM-only
  imports inside the file break at runtime;
   plus the existence
  check requires the explicit path.

## Why we do not file this upstream

The constraint is upstream's intentional choice.
 Walking the 5
constraints:

1. **Is it really upstream's fault?
   ** Borderline.
    The
   constraint exists by design (no bundled TS compiler) but
   the existence-check shape makes even `.cts` unusable
   without flags.
2. **Can upstream fix it?
   ** Yes;
    either accept a bundled
   stripper or add explicit `.cts` auto-discovery when Node
   supports it.
    Both are non-trivial commitments.
3. **Are they supporting this use case?
   ** No;
    the maintainer
   reply on #2728 is explicit.
4. **Will they likely fix it?
   ** No,
    given five years of
   inactivity on #2728.
5. **Have we prototyped a minimal fix?
   ** No.

Decision:
 no upstream report.
 The JSDoc approach matches the
ecosystem norm and the project preference.
