# Slint 1.17 embedded MCP server: it never starts for an app that installs its own platform with `set_platform`, and `SLINT_BACKEND=headless` is silently ignored

Tool under test:
 Slint 1.17.0 (`slint`,
 `i-slint-backend-winit`,
 `slint-build`,
 all pinned to `1.17.0`),
 embedded MCP
server (the `slint/mcp` Cargo feature,
 activated at runtime by `SLINT_MCP_PORT`).
 Surface trigger:
 a binary that
constructs the winit backend explicitly and calls `slint::platform::set_platform(...)` before creating its first
window (both desktop apps here do this,
 to stamp the Wayland `app_id`).
 Failure mode:
 with the `mcp` feature compiled
in and `SLINT_MCP_PORT` set,
 nothing ever listens on that port,
 and `SLINT_BACKEND=headless` opens a real window
instead of rendering off-screen.

## Symptom

Build the app with `--features slint/mcp`,
 run it with `SLINT_EMIT_DEBUG_INFO=1 SLINT_MCP_PORT=9315
SLINT_BACKEND=headless`,
 and:

- No TCP listener appears on `127.0.0.1:9315` (`ss -ltn | grep 9315` is empty;
   `curl http://127.0.0.1:9315/mcp`
  exits 7,
   connection refused).
- The process is otherwise healthy and stays running.
- Despite `SLINT_BACKEND=headless`,
   a real window is created on the live Wayland session (the headless request is
  ignored),
   so on a machine with a display you see the app pop up;
   on a headless box it fails to find a display
  instead of rendering off-screen.

There is no error message:
 the MCP server simply never initializes.
 The Slint runtime prints
`Slint MCP server listening on http://127.0.0.1:<port>/mcp` when it does start,
 and that line is absent.

## Root cause

Slint starts the embedded MCP server only when Slint itself creates the platform backend through its selector.
 An
app that calls `set_platform` supplies the backend first,
 so the selector's post-creation hook never runs.

The hook lives in the backend selector's `with_global_context`,
 which creates the backend and then,
 only if it
created one this call,
 initializes the testing/MCP backends:

```rust
// internal/backends/selector/lib.rs:189
pub fn with_global_context<R>(f: impl FnOnce(&SlintContext) -> R) -> Result<R, PlatformError> {
    let mut platform_created = false;
    let result = i_slint_core::with_global_context(
        || {
            let backend = create_backend();
            platform_created = backend.is_ok();
            backend
        },
        f,
    );

    #[cfg(any(feature = "system-testing", feature = "mcp"))]
    if result.is_ok() && platform_created {
        init_testing_backends();
    }

    result
}
```

`i_slint_core::with_global_context` runs its `create_backend` closure only when no platform has been set yet.
 If the
app already called `set_platform`,
 the closure never runs,
 `platform_created` stays `false`,
 and the
`init_testing_backends()` call is skipped.
 That function is the only caller of the MCP server init:

```rust
// internal/backends/selector/lib.rs:166
#[cfg(any(feature = "system-testing", feature = "mcp"))]
pub(crate) fn init_testing_backends() {
    #[cfg(feature = "system-testing")]
    if let Err(e) = i_slint_backend_testing::systest::init() {
        i_slint_core::debug_log!("System testing init failed: {e:?}");
    }

    #[cfg(feature = "mcp")]
    if let Err(e) = i_slint_backend_testing::mcp_server::init() {
        i_slint_core::debug_log!("MCP server init failed: {e:?}");
    }
}
```

Both consuming apps install their own platform.
 The music player builds the winit backend with a window-attributes
hook and sets it as the process platform:

```rust
// package/music-player/desktop-app/src/main.rs (before the fix)
let backend = builder.build()?;
slint::platform::set_platform(Box::new(backend))
    .expect("no Slint platform should already be set");
```

The terminal does the same in its `install_backend()`.
 Because `set_platform` wins the race,
 `create_backend()` is
never reached,
 so neither the selector's `SLINT_BACKEND` parsing nor `init_testing_backends()` runs.
 That single fact
explains both symptoms:
 the MCP server never binds,
 and `SLINT_BACKEND=headless` (which is handled inside
`create_backend`) has no effect.

`SLINT_BACKEND=headless` is itself gated on the `mcp` feature plus a software or skia renderer,
 so it only exists as a
value when the app is built with the feature:

```rust
// internal/backends/selector/lib.rs:130
#[cfg(all(feature = "mcp", supports_headless))]
"headless" => return create_headless_backend(_renderer),
```

`supports_headless` is `any(renderer-software, renderer-skia)` (selector `build.rs`),
 and both apps enable
`renderer-software`,
 so the headless path is available once the app stops bypassing the selector.

Separately,
 `ElementHandle` and the MCP introspection tools require debug info in the generated UI.
 Without it the
tools return an error rather than silently finding nothing:

```txt
The use of the ElementHandle API requires the presence of debug info in Slint compiler generated code.
Set the `SLINT_EMIT_DEBUG_INFO=1` environment variable at application build time or use `compile_with_config`
and `with_debug_info` with `slint_build`'s `CompilerConfiguration`
```

## Verification

Version under test:
 `slint`/`i-slint-backend-winit`/`slint-build` 1.17.0 (crates.io,
 released 2026-06-24);
 source read
from a shallow clone of `slint-ui/slint` whose `CHANGELOG.md` top section is `## [1.17.0] - 2026-06-24`
(`CHANGELOG.md:120` records `Added MCP server feature. (#11542)`).

Harness (from `package/music-player/desktop-app`):

```bash
# FAILS to bind before the fix (explicit set_platform runs unconditionally):
SLINT_EMIT_DEBUG_INFO=1 SLINT_MCP_PORT=9315 SLINT_BACKEND=headless \
  cargo run --features slint/mcp -- fixtures &
ss -ltn | grep 9315          # empty; server never bound
curl -s -m 3 http://127.0.0.1:9315/mcp   # exit 7, connection refused

# WORKS after the fix (set_platform skipped when SLINT_MCP_PORT is set):
mise run mcp -- fixtures &    # sets the three env vars, builds --features slint/mcp
ss -ltn | grep 9315          # LISTEN 127.0.0.1:9315
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9315/mcp -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json, text/event-stream' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-06-18","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"p","version":"0"}}}'
# -> {"result":{...,"serverInfo":{"name":"slint-mcp-embedded","version":"0.1.0"}}}
```

What works after the fix (verified end to end):
 `initialize`,
 `tools/list` (14 tools),
 `list_windows`,
`find_elements_by_id` with `elementsId: "AppWindow::seek-slider"` plus a `windowHandle`,
 `get_element_properties`
(read `accessibleValue`),
 `set_element_value` (set the seek slider to `0.5`,
 read back `0.5`),
 and `take_screenshot`
(a valid PNG showing the seek thumb at the midpoint).
 Both the music player (port 9315) and the terminal (port 9316)
bind and drive headless.

What fails (each is its own trap):

- `set_platform` present and no gate:
   MCP server never binds,
   `SLINT_BACKEND=headless` ignored (this doc's cause).
- `mcp` feature compiled but `SLINT_MCP_PORT` unset:
   `mcp_server::init()` returns immediately,
   no server (by design).
- Debug info absent (`SLINT_EMIT_DEBUG_INFO` unset at build):
   `find_elements_by_id` / `get_element_tree` and the
  `ElementHandle` unit-test API error with the message quoted above.
- `find_elements_by_id` argument named `id`:
   `Error: Invalid parameters: unknown field 'id'` (the field is
  `elementsId`);
   and calling it without a `windowHandle`:
   `Error: missing windowHandle`.

## Verified workarounds

All three are consumer-side and live in this repo.

Gate the explicit `set_platform` on `SLINT_MCP_PORT` being unset,
 so Slint creates the backend itself (and starts the
MCP server,
 honoring `SLINT_BACKEND`) whenever the port is set:

```rust
// package/music-player/desktop-app/src/main.rs
if std::env::var_os("SLINT_MCP_PORT").is_none() {
    // ... build the winit backend with the app-id hook and set_platform ...
}
// package/desktop-app/terminal/src/main.rs: install_backend() early-returns Ok(()) when the port is set.
```

Tradeoff:
 in MCP mode the Wayland `app_id` hook is dropped,
 so KDE taskbar grouping and taskbar progress do not apply
to the test instance.
 This is invisible to a headless test run and is the whole point (let Slint own the backend).
Production runs (`SLINT_MCP_PORT` unset) are byte-identical to before.

Pass the feature on the command line and set debug info only for the introspection build (the `mise run mcp` task
does both),
 never in `Cargo.toml [features]`:

```bash
SLINT_EMIT_DEBUG_INFO=1 cargo build --features slint/mcp
```

Tradeoff:
 `SLINT_EMIT_DEBUG_INFO` embeds element ids and source locations,
 which slightly enlarges the UI data and is
why it is kept out of the size-optimized production build.
 `cargo` rebuilds the UI when the variable toggles between
the `mcp`/`test` tasks and the production `build`/`run` tasks.

Isolate the test instance's state so it never collides with a running installed app.
 The music player opens a Turso
cache at `~/.config/musicplayer/peaks.db`;
 a second instance hits
`Locking error: Failed locking file ... locked by another process` (logged,
 non-fatal,
 from
`package/music-player/desktop-app/src/peakcache_service.rs`).
 The `mise run mcp` task points
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`/`XDG_CACHE_HOME`/`XDG_DATA_HOME` at a throwaway `target/mcp-xdg` so it never touches the user's real
session or cache.

Tradeoff:
 the test instance starts from an empty session every run (no restored queue/volume),
 which is the correct
behavior for a reproducible test.

## What does not work

- `SLINT_BACKEND=testing` for screenshots:
   that backend keeps the mock renderer with fixed font metrics and renders
  no pixels,
   so `take_screenshot` produces nothing.
   Only `SLINT_BACKEND=headless` (mcp feature + software/skia
  renderer) renders real frames off-screen.
   `SLINT_BACKEND=headless` is marked unstable by Slint and its exact value
  may change between releases.
- Putting `mcp` in `Cargo.toml [features]` (or a default feature):
   it would compile the introspection server into the
  production binary.
   Keep it command-line only.
- A nested `mise run` from inside a package task to stage build artifacts:
   on this repo it re-loads the
  sops-encrypted mise config and aborts with `failed to decrypt sops file ... no data key retrieved`.
   The terminal
  `mcp` task stages `libghostty-vt` inline (glob plus copy) instead of shelling out to
  `mise run ...:stage:runtime-libs:debug` for that reason.

## Upstream filing decision

`.out-of-scope/` holds no Slint or MCP exemption (checked `bun-install.md`,
 `cargo-workspace.md`,
`claude-code-upstream-bugs.md`,
 `codex-harness.md`,
 `jsr.md`,
 `lightningcss.md`,
`low-impact-typescript-formatting.md`,
 `module-es-monolith.md`,
 `pi-gpt55-long-context.md`,
`terminal-title-fork-parity-tests.md`),
 so the 6-constraint check applies.

1. Really upstream's fault?
    Partly.
    The behavior is a consequence of `set_platform` bypassing the selector,
    which is
   defensible design (if you supply your own platform you opt out of the selector's extras).
    The gap is that this is
   undocumented:
    the MCP docs assume `cargo run --features slint/mcp` with the default backend and never mention that
   a custom `set_platform` disables the server.
    So this reads as a documentation gap,
    not a code defect.
2. Can upstream fix it?
    Yes,
    cheaply (call the MCP init from a `set_platform` path too,
    or document the interaction),
   so this constraint does not fail.
3. Supporting this use case?
    The `mcp` feature clearly targets agent-driven UIs,
    but nothing in the docs covers the
   custom-platform combination;
    support for it is unstated.
4. Would the repo welcome the contribution?
    Not established here;
    a doc-only note is low value and the code change is
   debatable design,
    so this is weak.
5. Will they likely fix it?
    No signal either way;
    plausibly "working as intended" for a self-set platform.
6. Prototyped a minimal fix?
    Not attempted.
    The user-facing problem is fully solved consumer-side by the one-line
   gate above,
    which is the correct place for it (an app that opts into a custom platform opts into managing this).

Constraints 3 to 5 are soft-to-weak and the clean fix is consumer-side,
 so this does not clear the bar to file,
 and
the auto-prototype trigger (1 to 5 all holding or sorta-holding) is not met.
 Decision:
 do not file.
 No duplicate
search escalation is warranted for a documentation-gap that is resolved at our boundary;
 if a future session wants
to push a docs note upstream,
 re-run the duplicate search (`gh search issues --repo slint-ui/slint mcp set_platform`)
and the constraint check first.
