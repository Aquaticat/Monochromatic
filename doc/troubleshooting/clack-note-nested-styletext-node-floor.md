# Clack 1.7.0 note formatter snapshots fail on Node 22.18.0 because nested styleText resets outer color

## Symptom

Running Clack 1.7.0's default test suite on supported Node 22.18.0 reports four failures from
`packages/prompts/test/note.test.ts`:

```text
Test Files  1 failed | 17 passed (18)
Tests  4 failed | 593 passed (597)
```

Vitest identifies each failure as a snapshot mismatch.
The expected text reopens red after nested cyan formatting with ANSI code `31m`.
The received text instead emits foreground reset code `39m`,
so trailing formatter text loses its outer color.

The input,
multiselect,
and confirmation suites still pass.
The failure is specific to the `note()` formatter tests that nest `node:util` `styleText()` calls.

## Root cause

### Clack's formatter test requires nested outer-style restoration

[`packages/prompts/test/note.test.ts:70-87`][clack-note-test]
creates cyan inner text inside red outer text:

```ts
format: (line) => styleText('red', `* ${styleText('cyan', line)} *`),
```

The checked-in snapshot expects the red style to resume after the cyan close code.
Clack's [`packages/prompts/src/note.ts:24-28`][clack-note-source]
invokes that caller formatter before and after wrapping:

```ts
const maxWidthFormat = wrapMsg.map(format).reduce((sum, ln) => Math.max(stringWidth(ln), sum), 0);
const wrapWidth = width - (maxWidthFormat - maxWidthNormal);
return wrapAnsi(message, wrapWidth, opts);
```

The formatter's ANSI sequence is therefore produced by Node before Clack measures and renders it.

### Node 22.18.0 does not restore outer nested styles

This minimal call on Node 22.18.0 emits `39m` after cyan:

```js
styleText('red', `* ${styleText('cyan', 'x', { validateStream: false })} *`, {
  validateStream: false,
});
```

Observed JSON encoding:

```text
"\u001b[31m* \u001b[36mx\u001b[39m *\u001b[39m"
```

Node's fix,
[`util: respect nested formats in styleText`][node-nested-fix],
changed `lib/util.js` to replace an inner closing code with the active outer opening code when more text follows:

```js
if (offset + match.length < text.length) {
  return `${escapeStyleCode(code[0])}`;
}
return match;
```

Node 22.19.0 includes that change.
The same probe then emits red reopening code `31m`,
matching Clack's snapshot:

```text
"\u001b[31m* \u001b[36mx\u001b[31m *\u001b[39m"
```

### Clack's declared runtime floor predates the Node fix

Both published package manifests declare Node `>=20.12.0`.
[`packages/prompts/package.json:49-52`][clack-manifest]
contains:

```json
"engines": {
  "node": ">= 20.12.0"
}
```

The repository's `.nvmrc` and Volta configuration select Node 20.18.1.
Those declarations admit runtimes without nested `styleText()` restoration,
while the snapshot requires the later behavior.
Current Clack `main` still declares the same floor.

## Verification

### Versions and environment

- Clack:
  `@clack/prompts` 1.7.0,
  source commit `dc5bce8aae84a57b5863124adfaa839c1db1fa23`.
- Failing runtime:
  Node 22.18.0,
  container digest `sha256:752ea8a2f758c34002a0461bd9f1cee4f9a3c36d48494586f60ffce1fc708e0e`.
- Passing runtime:
  Node 22.19.0,
  container digest `sha256:cff78eb5aa1cf27dc2b6aeea9d31366415a43e9a9ea0ddec00d780b2b66fad0f`.
- Bounds:
  2 GiB memory,
  two CPUs,
  256 processes,
  no credentials,
  and no network during tests.

The failing suite command was:

```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm run types
pnpm run test
```

A focused reproduction is:

```bash
pnpm --dir packages/prompts exec vitest run test/note.test.ts
```

### Failing behavior catalog

On Node 22.18.0:

- formatted long note with CI rendering;
- formatted wide-character note with CI rendering;
- formatted long note with ordinary rendering;
- formatted wide-character note with ordinary rendering.

Every case expects outer red restoration and receives a foreground reset.

### Working behavior catalog

On Node 22.18.0:

- all 148 `@clack/core` tests pass;
- all 98 targeted high-level text,
  multiselect,
  and confirmation tests pass;
- plain note formatting without nested styles passes.

On Node 22.19.0:

- all 18 focused note tests pass;
- the nested `styleText()` positive control emits outer red restoration.

A Node 26.7.0 positive control emits the same restored sequence as Node 22.19.0.

## Verified workarounds

### Run Clack on Node 22.19.0 or newer

Node 22.19.0 contains the nested-format fix.
The focused Clack note suite passes unchanged on that exact runtime.

Tradeoff:
this drops Clack's declared Node 20 support and earlier Node 22 minors.

### Avoid nested `styleText()` calls in note formatters

A formatter can apply one style to its complete line
or use a coloring implementation that restores nested outer styles independently of Node's built-in behavior.

Tradeoff:
callers lose mixed nested colors or add another formatting dependency.
This does not make Clack's own supported-runtime test matrix coherent.

### Raise Clack's declared Node floor

A disposable prototype changes `.nvmrc`,
Volta,
and both package engine declarations to Node 22.19.0.
The patch is recorded in
[`clack-note-nested-styletext-node-floor.patch`](clack-note-nested-styletext-node-floor.patch).
The focused note suite then passes on Node 22.19.0.

Tradeoff:
raising the floor is a package compatibility decision rather than a local test-only correction.

## What does not work

### Updating the snapshots on Node 22.18.0

Accepting `39m` records the lost outer color as expected output.
It hides the supported-runtime mismatch rather than restoring formatting.

### Treating the four failures as random snapshot drift

All four diffs replace the same expected `31m` reopening code with `39m`.
The standalone Node probe reproduces that exact transition.

### Using only Clack's current CI runtime as the compatibility claim

Clack CI uses unpinned Node 22 through its reusable workflow.
A current Node 22 runner includes the fix,
but the package engine range and contributor configuration admit older runtimes.
Testing only the newest minor cannot verify the published floor.

## Upstream filing decision

No `.out-of-scope/` entry covers Clack,
Node `styleText()`,
or terminal prompt snapshots.
Open and closed Clack Issues and pull requests were searched for:

- `styleText nested Node 22.18 snapshot note`;
- `minimum node styleText nested format`.

No duplicate was found.

1. **Is it really upstream's fault?**
   Yes.
   Node's historical behavior caused the color loss,
   but Clack's package range declares affected runtimes while its snapshots require the fixed behavior.
2. **Can upstream fix it?**
   Yes.
   Clack can raise its runtime floor,
   revise its formatter contract,
   or avoid depending on nested built-in formatting behavior.
3. **Are they supporting this use case?**
   Yes.
   `note()` explicitly accepts a formatter,
   and the upstream suite asserts nested colored formatter output.
4. **Would the repo welcome our contribution?**
   Yes.
   `CONTRIBUTING.md` requests reproductions,
   environment details,
   tests,
   and pull requests.
   Its pull request template permits AI-generated code when disclosed.
   No policy forbids a human-verified issue report.
5. **Will they likely fix it?**
   Plausible.
   Maintenance and release activity are current,
   and the relevant formatter tests remain active.
   No maintainer rejection or stated non-goal was found.
6. **Have we prototyped a minimal fix compatible with their architecture?**
   Yes.
   The recorded patch aligns package engines and contributor runtimes with Node 22.19.0.
   The focused suite fails before the runtime-floor change on Node 22.18.0
   and passes under the selected floor on Node 22.19.0.

All constraints pass.

Title: Clack 1.7.0 note formatter snapshots fail on supported Node 22.18.0

Labels: bug

## Environment

- OS: Linux x86_64
- Node: 22.18.0
- Package: `@clack/prompts`
- Package version: 1.7.0
- Source: `dc5bce8aae84a57b5863124adfaa839c1db1fa23`

## Description

`pnpm test` reports four `packages/prompts/test/note.test.ts` snapshot failures on Node 22.18.0.
The expected output reopens outer red with `31m` after nested cyan.
Node 22.18.0 emits foreground reset `39m` instead.

Both package manifests currently declare Node `>=20.12.0`,
and the repository selects Node 20.18.1.
The snapshots require Node's later nested-`styleText()` behavior,
which Node 22.19.0 includes.

## Reproduction

```js
import { styleText } from 'node:util';

console.log(JSON.stringify(
  styleText('red', `* ${styleText('cyan', 'x', { validateStream: false })} *`, {
    validateStream: false,
  }),
));
```

Node 22.18.0:

```text
"\u001b[31m* \u001b[36mx\u001b[39m *\u001b[39m"
```

Node 22.19.0:

```text
"\u001b[31m* \u001b[36mx\u001b[31m *\u001b[39m"
```

Focused Clack command:

```bash
pnpm --dir packages/prompts exec vitest run test/note.test.ts
```

It fails four snapshots on Node 22.18.0 and passes all 18 tests on Node 22.19.0.

## Suggested fix

Align `.nvmrc`,
root Volta configuration,
and both package `engines.node` values on Node 22.19.0 or newer.
A verified four-file patch is available.
If retaining Node 20 is required,
the formatter contract or implementation needs a different compatibility strategy instead of snapshot updates.
