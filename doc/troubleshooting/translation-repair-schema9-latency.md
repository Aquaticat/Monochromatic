# Translation-repair schema 9 at 88049530a spent 80 minutes in grace before naturalness refusal

## Symptom

Fresh `Weideriche_` schema-9 validation started from commit `88049530a` on 2026-08-29.
First corpus entry ended after 6,433,300 milliseconds with a retryable absolute-naturalness refusal.
It wrote no page or artifact.
Operator stopped second entry after first failure,
so second entry is not timing evidence.

Matched first entries from preceding schema-9 runs ended after 3,014,684 and 3,774,160 milliseconds.
Prior totals therefore supported initial 61 to 84-minute whole-process estimate,
but did not predict this entry's extra rounds and repeated grace exhaustion.

## Root cause

This was not idle process or deadlock.
Log modification continued within seconds of observation,
and model streams and round completions continued until refusal.

Measured first-entry phase wall times were:

- preparation before document lanes: 10 seconds
- repair lane: 2,151 seconds
- translate lane: 1,301 seconds
- lane contest: 613 seconds
- consolidation and final naturalness work: 2,358 seconds

Round logs attributed 4,797,358 milliseconds,
79.96 minutes,
to post-quorum grace.
That is 74.6 percent of first-entry wall time.
Matched prior entries spent 1,987,611 and 2,628,052 milliseconds in grace.
Grace growth therefore explains 82.2 percent of difference from 3,014,684-millisecond run and
81.6 percent of difference from 3,774,160-millisecond run.

`package/module/translation-repair/src/stage-round.ts:269` starts round clock.
`package/module/translation-repair/src/stage-round.ts:366` waits for remaining seats after quorum.
`package/module/translation-repair/src/stage-round.ts:419` emits total,
time-to-quorum,
and grace wall time.

```ts
await settleWithin({
  promise: Promise.allSettled(asks,),
  ms: graceMs,
},);
```

GLM-5.3-Flash reached 180,000-millisecond post-quorum abandonment eleven times in first entry.
Comparable entries recorded two and four such abandonments.
Current entry also recorded three Synthetic HTTP 503 responses and five structured-reply mismatches.
Those conditions triggered lost voices or recovery calls,
but repeated grace waits were larger measured cost.

Completed-call latency does not support general provider slowdown:
GLM-5.3-Flash completed-call p90 was 137,318 milliseconds,
compared with 150,636 and 143,240 milliseconds in matched entries.
This excludes abandoned calls,
so it establishes only that completed calls did not all shift slower.

Nondeterministic quality work multiplied exposure to stragglers:

- current repair ran sixteen selection rounds, compared with twelve and ten
- current consolidation ran twenty-seven rounds, compared with ten and fourteen
- current consolidation ran six absolute reviews, compared with one and two
- current consolidation ran six refinement rounds, compared with two and three

The exact final candidate then failed correctly.
Independent replay heard all eight seats:
seven accepted and GPT-OSS rejected with one idiomatic-naturalness finding in paragraph three.
Finding's affected phrase existed before second correction and survived all three second-correction proposals.
Correction selection was unanimous,
including GPT-OSS ballot,
but selection chooses best available faithful correction and does not certify absolute publishability.
Independent replay of previous correction candidate was also unacceptable,
with GPT-OSS and DeepSeek Flash each returning one finding.
Replayed GPT findings differed across adjacent candidates;
this supports iterative defect discovery rather than proof latest required finding was ignored.
Final absolute review remains independent and correctly refused publication after second correction cap.

## Correction quality before next validation

First instrumented relaunch from `0bf949cfa` was premature because it changed observability,
not correction quality.
It was stopped immediately and its fresh root is not validation evidence.

Correction selection still carried comparative framing:
all eight judges selected best available proposal,
then independent absolute review rejected exact winner.
Generic selector did permit decline,
but required-correction criteria left publication quality as later ranking criterion instead of explicit eligibility floor.

Consolidation cache generation 11 changes absolute-review and required-correction questions:

- absolute reviewers are instructed to perform separate sentence-level and whole-passage scans and return union of material defects
- rewriters are instructed to perform finding-led pass,
  then set findings aside and reread every affected sentence as native-English editor
- inherited wording receives no presumption of acceptability merely because finding did not name it
- selectors treat fidelity,
  complete finding resolution,
  and absence of any material naturalness defect as joint hard eligibility floor
- selectors assess each candidate in isolation before comparison
- selectors must decline all proposals when every one remains materially unnatural,
  even if one is least awkward

Prompt changes still did not make selection absolute certification:
a generated correction removed demonstrated defect but introduced different idiomatic defect,
selector chose it,
and exact review rejected it.
Two alternate proposals also failed exact absolute review.

Same exact final candidate then flipped from rejection in original run and first replay to eight-seat acceptance in later replay.
Generation 11 therefore requires one sequential exact-half-quorum confirmation after first acceptance.
A rejection heard before either bounded settlement remains immediately decisive;
accepted text ships only after second quorum acceptance of exact same candidate.
Generation 12 applies exact-half required participation to every direct roster round;
no stage waits on every provider seat as requirement.
First post-generation-11 validation was stopped during repair lane when this participation correction arrived;
its partial root is not validation evidence.
Schema-9 `confirmations` retains earlier acceptable review with candidate and paragraph digests,
while decisive `rounds` remains one per generated candidate for adjacent correction-chain verification.
Telemetry emits one privacy-safe absolute-review round and seat-summary line per draw,
so first-pass acceptance followed by confirmation produces two such pairs for same exact candidate.
Cost reports must count both draws rather than treating second pair as duplicate logging.
Legacy schema-9 artifacts without confirmation field remain readable.

Two-correction cap,
fidelity gate,
exact final absolute review,
and terminal refusal remain unchanged.
Generation bump prevents reuse of settlements bought under relative correction selection or single-review acceptance.

Directional replay held prior three proposals and final replay finding fixed.
Original correction ledger had all eight judges select candidate one.
Under generation-11 selector question all eight independently declined all candidates.
This proves new hard floor can expose exact demonstrated failure mode;
it is prompt evidence,
not fresh publication evidence.
A second generated slate was still selected despite all three candidates later failing exact review,
which is why repeated absolute acceptance is enforcement rather than selector wording alone.

## Active generation-12 timing evidence

Snapshot taken 2026-08-29 at 12:14 UTC.

`Weideriche_` process `proc_a259` had completed repair and translate after recording these slice costs:

- repair: 0.001, 927.787, 883.347, and 17.230 seconds
- translate: 427.660, 250.694, 264.892, and 8.567 seconds

Lane contest was active and no terminal tally existed at snapshot.
First attempt later refused slice 1 absolute naturalness at 4,840,305 milliseconds,
wrote no artifact or page,
and queued automatic reattempt with 13 additional cache records.
Process remained active on cache-warm second attempt.
Log is
`~/temp/agent/validation-Weideriche-schema9-half-quorum-v12-20260829.log`.

Pull-request 386 `Carena0442` process `proc_3a1c` had prepared 22 slices and started first non-metadata repair slice.
Log is
`~/temp/agent/validation-pr386-Carena0442-schema9-half-quorum-v12-20260829.log`.
Exact pull-request provenance is in
`~/temp/agent/pr386-Carena0442-run-provenance-20260829.md`.

These runs overlap and share provider capacity.
Their elapsed-time ratio cannot measure scaling or concurrency benefit.
The pull-request fixture also has different pipeline digest
because corpus pin and clone location are explicit throwaway inputs.
Wait for terminal tally,
phase reports,
publication verification,
and complete-page quality reading before performance recommendation.
Detailed protocol is `doc/planning/translation-repair-entry-time-to-complete.md`.

## Missing observability

Existing logs were sufficient to prove aggregate cause only after correlating:

- round timestamps
- ledger sequence
- slice-cache modification times
- terminal tally

They were not sufficient to identify currently active consolidation slice during run,
assign correction rounds to slices directly,
or name which absolute-review seats rejected without replay.
That made healthy but expensive quality work look like unbounded wait.

Logging now closes consolidation and absolute-review gaps:

- `package/module/translation-repair/src/slice-cost-log.ts:136` defines `SLICE-START`
- `package/module/translation-repair/src/consolidate-driver.ts:299` brackets every consolidation slice
- consolidation exits distinguish `computed`, `resumed`, `reused`, `unsettled`, `failed`, and `aborted`
- `package/module/translation-repair/src/absolute-naturalness-review-stage.ts:292` summarizes each seat's status,
  finding count,
  paragraph numbers,
  and finding digests
- summaries carry ids,
  counts,
  locations,
  digests,
  and timings only,
  never candidate or reviewer wording

Future consolidation logs will identify slice at dispatch and emit corresponding `SLICE-COST` on every scoped exit.
`slice-cost-report` now includes consolidation beside repair and translate.
Lane contest retains existing round-level timing rather than per-slice cost bracket.

## Verification

Build before tests because tests import `dist/`:

```sh
mise run //package/module/translation-repair:build
node package/module/translation-repair/src/slice-cost-read.unit.test.ts
node package/module/translation-repair/src/consolidate-driver.unit.test.ts
node package/module/translation-repair/src/absolute-naturalness-review-stage.unit.test.ts
node package/module/translation-repair/src/consolidation-polish.unit.test.ts
node package/module/translation-repair/src/corpus-run/artifact-two-lane-read-naturalness-review.unit.test.ts
```

Tests prove:

- start marker precedes terminal cost record
- consolidation cache resume reports `exit=resumed`
- unsettled consolidation remains distinct from completed work
- caller abort overrides provisional failure while terminal cache exits remain named
- absolute-review summary names each seat status,
  finding count,
  paragraph,
  and digest without wording
- first acceptance followed by rejection feeds one bounded correction
- settled candidate retains first acceptance and decisive confirmation separately
- schema-9 reader binds every confirmation to exact decisive candidate and refuses missing final,
  rejected,
  duplicate,
  or unbound confirmation evidence when field is present

Operator-boundary report verification:

```sh
mise run //package/module/translation-repair:slice-cost-report -- \
  "$HOME/temp/agent/validation-Weideriche-schema9-eight-roster-20260829.log"
```

Existing run prints repair and translate without inventing absent consolidation rows.
A temporary one-row consolidation fixture separately printed consolidation at 0.2 minutes;
that fixture is verification evidence,
not repository input.

Re-run latency extraction against private pass log:

```sh
grep ' round:' "$HOME/temp/agent/validation-Weideriche-schema9-eight-roster-20260829.log"
grep 'abandoned 180000ms after quorum' \
  "$HOME/temp/agent/validation-Weideriche-schema9-eight-roster-20260829.log"
```

`runGatherRound` lines are direct phase evidence because production overlap was one and stages ran serially.

## Verified workarounds

Keep fail-closed naturalness floor and two-correction cap.
The run spent additional time but prevented known unnatural wording from publication.

Use `SLICE-START`,
`SLICE-COST`,
and per-seat status summaries for future ETA and diagnosis.
This changes observability only,
not quorum,
grace,
model eligibility,
or publication decision.

Do not lower 180-second production grace from this run alone.
Delayed rejection is release-critical,
and current evidence combines more quality rounds with one model's repeated nontermination.
A grace change requires matched output-quality evidence,
not latency preference.

## What does not work

- Extrapolating whole-run ETA from two prior totals does not work when generated output changes number of repair and correction rounds.
- Treating recent log modification as remaining-time evidence does not work.
  It proves liveness only.
- Counting completed streams alone does not price abandoned calls.
  Completed-call percentiles exclude exact calls consuming full grace.
- Multiplying roster count by average call time does not work.
  Seats run concurrently inside each round,
  while rounds and overlap-one slices serialize.
- Process exit code does not prove publication.
  Terminal tally,
  artifact count,
  page count,
  and `verify-published` remain required.
- Removing or weakening final rejection to save time does not work.
  Independent replay reproduced unacceptable verdict on exact candidate.

## Upstream filing decision

Synthetic is hosted service.
No provider source repository or matching issue tracker was found through
[Synthetic API documentation][api-overview] or public repository search.

1. **Is it upstream's fault?** Partly.
   Synthetic returned queue/full-target 503 responses,
   and GLM-5.3-Flash repeatedly streamed until local grace cut it.
   Pipeline's accumulated wait is also deliberate local quality policy.
2. **Can upstream fix it?** Provider can improve target availability and terminate pathological streams.
3. **Are they supporting this use case?** Yes for chat completion and structured output.
4. **Would repository welcome contribution?** Unknown because no provider source repository was found.
5. **Will they likely fix it?** Unknown without public tracker or service incident record.
6. **Have we prototyped compatible fix?** No upstream patch is possible from available source.
   Local patch improves diagnosis without changing request contract.

Constraints four through six do not pass,
so no upstream issue or additive comment should be filed.
If provider exposes public tracker later,
a privacy-safe report can include timestamp,
model id,
HTTP statuses,
and abandonment counts without corpus text.
