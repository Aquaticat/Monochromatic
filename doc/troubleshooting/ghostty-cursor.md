# Claude Code (Ink terminal UI) hides the real terminal cursor and renders an inverse-video block, overriding Ghostty's `cursor-style = bar`

## Symptom

Ghostty is configured with `cursor-style = bar`.
 The shell prompt
shows a bar cursor.
 Launching `claude` (Claude Code CLI) replaces
the cursor in the input area with a solid block:

1. Set `cursor-style = bar` in `~/.config/ghostty/config`.
2. Confirm the shell prompt shows a bar cursor.
3. Launch `claude`.
4. Observe a solid block at the `>` input prompt,
    regardless of
   Ghostty's configured cursor style.

On exiting Claude Code,
 the bar cursor returns to the shell prompt.

## Root cause

Claude Code's input area does not use the real terminal cursor at
all.
 The Ink terminal-UI framework (React-style rendering for TTYs)
hides the cursor on mount and renders a **visual** cursor by
inverse-video-printing a space character via Chalk's `inverse`
modifier.

Source locations in the extracted Claude Code bundle
(`claude-code-2.1.75.js`):

- The TextInput component sets a default cursor styler:
  `invert: f = f$.inverse` (Chalk's inverse modifier).
- When `showCursor && focus && terminalFocus` is true,
   the
  component renders `f(" ")`:
   an inverse-video space character
  positioned where the cursor would appear.
- When the component has focus,
   the cursor character uses
  `f$.inverse` unconditionally;
   there is no branch that emits a
  DECSCUSR cursor-style sequence.

On mount,
 Ink sends `\x1b[?25l` to hide the real terminal cursor.
The cursor stays hidden for the entire session,
 so Ghostty's
configured shape is moot:
 the user is looking at an inverse-video
block painted by the application,
 not the terminal cursor.

On exit,
 Ink sends `\x1b[?25h` to restore visibility,
 and Ghostty's
shell-integration `PS1` hook re-issues `\e[5 q` to restore the bar.

A separate,
 related finding (covered below) is in Ghostty's
terminfo,
 but it is independent of the Claude Code rendering choice.

## Verification

Version under test:

- Claude Code 2.1.75
- Ghostty 1.0+ with `cursor-style = bar`
- Bash or zsh with Ghostty shell integration enabled

Reproduce:
 set `cursor-style = bar` in Ghostty's config;
 verify the
shell prompt's bar cursor;
 launch `claude`;
 observe the block.

Inspecting the bundle for cursor-related sequences confirms the
finding:

- `claude-code-2.1.75.js` contains zero DECSCUSR sequences (`\e[N q`
  with any N).
- The only cursor-related escape sequences are visibility toggles:
  `\x1b[?25l` (hide) and `\x1b[?25h` (show).

Ghostty's side is behaving correctly:

- `stream_handler.zig:874-888`:
   `\e[0 q` handler restores
  `default_cursor_style` from config via `self.default_cursor_style`.
- `Config.zig:872`:
   `cursor-style = bar` maps to the `.bar` enum
  variant.
- `cursor.zig:4-15`:
   `.bar` is the bar shape with no lossy
  conversion.

The combination of "Claude Code hides the cursor" and "Claude Code
never emits a DECSCUSR" means no Ghostty setting can affect the
appearance,
 because the rendered glyph is application-layer,
 not
terminal-layer.

## Verified workaround

There is no workaround that recovers Ghostty's bar shape while
Claude Code is running.
 The cursor the user sees is application
output;
 the terminal does not control it.

Tradeoff:
 accept the visual divergence between shell prompt
(bar) and Claude Code prompt (block).
 The alternative is to wait
for a Claude Code update that supports cursor-style customisation
(see upstream tracking below).

## What does not work

- **`cursor-style = bar` in `ghostty.config`**:
   correctly sets the
  terminal default.
   Claude Code hides the real cursor,
   so the
  setting is irrelevant once the app starts.
- **Issuing `\e[0 q` from a `PS0` preexec hook before Claude Code
  starts**:
   correctly resets the shape to the configured default,
  but the shape no longer applies because the cursor is hidden.
- **`Se` / `Ss` terminfo capabilities**:
   Claude Code does not use
  terminfo for cursor shape;
   the hardcoded `f$.inverse` rendering
  bypasses any terminfo entry.
- **`infocmp` / patching Ghostty's terminfo**:
   same as above;
   the
  application does not consult terminfo for cursor shape.

## Why we do not file this upstream (Claude Code)

This is a known limitation tracked in multiple Claude Code issues.
Walking the 5 constraints:

1. **Is it really upstream's fault?
   ** Borderline.
    Ink's
   inverse-video cursor is a deliberate cross-terminal design that
   trades native cursor support for layout reliability.
    Claude
   Code inherits that design.
2. **Can upstream fix it?
   ** Yes;
    emit DECSCUSR sequences in the
   TextInput component when the terminal advertises support,
    or
   expose a config flag that switches between visual and native
   cursor.
    Both are plausible but require Ink-level changes.
3. **Are they supporting this use case?
   ** Several open issues
   request customisation;
    Anthropic has acknowledged the friction
   but not committed to a fix.
4. **Will they likely fix it?
   ** Unknown;
    the multiple open issues
   suggest demand exists but has not been prioritised.
5. **Have we prototyped a minimal fix?
   ** No.

 no new upstream report.

## Separate finding: Ghostty's terminfo defines `Se=\E[2 q` (steady block) instead of `\E[0 q` (reset to user default)

Located at `ghostty.zig:116`.

When programs that consult terminfo (vim,
 neovim,
 tmux) need to
restore cursor style after switching modes,
 they emit the `Se`
capability.
 Ghostty's `Se` resolves to `\E[2 q` (steady block),
which triggers the `.steady_block` branch in `setCursorStyle`
instead of the `.default` branch that would restore the
configured `cursor-style`.
 The result is that programs which
faithfully use terminfo end up with a steady block rather than
the user's preferred bar.

This is **independent** of the Claude Code finding above (Claude
Code does not use terminfo at all).
 It affects different
applications,
 but the root cause is in Ghostty's terminfo
definition.

### Upstream filing audit (Ghostty)

1. **Is it really upstream's fault?
   ** Yes;
    `Se` should encode
   "reset to default" (`\E[0 q`),
    not "steady block".
2. **Can upstream fix it?
   ** Yes;
    one-line value change at
   `src/terminfo/ghostty.zig:116`.
3. **Are they supporting this use case?
   ** Yes;
    Ghostty's mission
   includes accurate terminfo.
4. **Will they likely fix it?
   ** Yes (already accepted;
    see
   "Upstream status" below).
5. **Have we prototyped a minimal fix?
   ** Yes.
    The minimal patch is
   the one-line value swap below,
    identical to the upstream
   commit `6c68650920804a202a3208d7d355368c9dd28a46`:

   ```

   Verification:
    the patch changes only the user-defined extended
   capability `Se`,
    which round-trips byte-for-byte through `tic` to
   a binary terminfo database and back through `infocmp -L -x`.
    This
   was checked at the terminfo-source level rather than via the full
   `build_data_exe +terminfo` pipeline because the changed line is
   exactly one capability value in
   `Source.encode()`'s output;
    nothing in the encoder,
    tic compiler,
   or infocmp decoder transforms the value string.
    The targeted
   harness was a minimal `.ti` file with the broken vs fixed `Se`
   plus the `Ss` parameterised setter (so `tic` accepts both as a
   pair):

   ```sh
   $ tic -x -o "$DB" broken.ti  # ghostty-broken with Se=\E[2 q
   $ tic -x -o "$DB" fixed.ti   # ghostty-fixed   with Se=\E[0 q
   $ diff \
       <(TERMINFO="$DB" infocmp -1 -x ghostty-broken) \
       <(TERMINFO="$DB" infocmp -1 -x ghostty-fixed)
   1,3c1,3

   > #     Reconstructed via infocmp from file: .../db/./g/ghostty-fixed
   > ghostty-fixed|Ghostty after Se fix,
   >       Se=\E[0 q,
   ```

   The only inter-file difference is exactly the byte the patch
   changes;
    the existing Ghostty `stream_handler.zig:874-888` handler
   already maps `\E[0 q` to "restore `default_cursor_style` from
   config" (cited in the Verification section above),
    so the cursor
   behaviour on real terminals follows from the terminfo emission
   without a separate runtime probe.

Decision:
 already fixed upstream;
 no new issue to file.

subsection for the upstream artefacts and the release window.

### Upstream status (Ghostty)

The fix was filed and merged before this audit ran:

- Issue:

- Merged commit on `main`:
   `6c68650920804a202a3208d7d355368c9dd28a46`.

The fix is not yet in any tagged release.
 As of audit time,
 the
latest tag is `v1.3.1`,
 which still ships `Se=\E[2 q`;
 upstream
`main` is 842 commits ahead of `v1.3.1` and carries the corrected
value.
 Users on releases hit the bug until the next tag;
 users
building from `main` are already covered.

Title: terminfo: `Se` should be `\E[0 q` (reset to default) instead of `\E[2 q` (steady block)

Labels: bug, terminfo

## Description

`src/terminfo/ghostty.zig:116` defines the `Se` (reset cursor
style) capability as `\E[2 q`, which is the DECSCUSR "steady block"
sequence. The semantic intent of `Se` in terminfo is "reset to the
user-configured default", which Ghostty implements as `\E[0 q`
inside the stream handler:

- `src/terminfo/ghostty.zig:116`:
  `.{ .name = "Se", .value = .{ .string = "\E[2 q" } }`
- `src/terminal/stream_handler.zig:874-888`: `\E[0 q` restores
  `default_cursor_style` from config; `\E[2 q` forces steady block.

Consequence: applications that consult terminfo (vim, neovim,
tmux) emit `Se` to restore the cursor after a mode switch, and end
up with steady block regardless of the user's `cursor-style`
setting.

## Reproduction

1. Set `cursor-style = bar` in `~/.config/ghostty/config`.
2. Launch a Ghostty window; confirm bar cursor at the shell prompt.
3. Run `tput cnorm`, or open vim/neovim and exit, or open tmux and
   detach. Each of these emits `Se`.
4. Observe the cursor is now steady block instead of bar.
