# macOS release builds warn `stripping debug info with rust-objcopy failed: SIGABRT` (libLLVM.dylib), but the binary is still stripped

## Symptom

A `cargo build --release` of `package/music-player/desktop-app` on the Apple
Silicon Mac (`ssh m1`,
 rustc 1.98.0-nightly,
 `nightly-aarch64-apple-darwin`)
finishes successfully (exit 0) but prints one warning,
 because the
`[profile.release] strip = "symbols"` setting runs `rust-objcopy` as a post-link
step and it aborts:

```text
warning: stripping debug info with `rust-objcopy` failed: signal: 6 (SIGABRT)
  = note: dyld[NNNNN]: Library not loaded: @rpath/libLLVM.dylib
            Referenced from: <...> /Users/user/.rustup/toolchains/nightly-aarch64-apple-darwin/lib/rustlib/aarch64-apple-darwin/bin/rust-objcopy
            Reason: tried: '.../aarch64-apple-darwin/bin/../lib/libLLVM.dylib' (no such file), ...
warning: `music-player` (build script) generated 1 warning
    Finished `release` profile [optimized] target(s) in ...
```

It also appears on the unmodified crate:
 the `strip = "symbols"` profile setting
predates the cross-platform work,
 so it is not caused by the cpal/QoS/identity
changes.

## Root cause

`rustc`'s `strip = "symbols"` invokes the toolchain's bundled `rust-objcopy`,
which dynamically loads `libLLVM.dylib` via the `@rpath/libLLVM.dylib` install
name and the `LC_RPATH` `@loader_path/../lib`.
 Two facts,
 both verified on the
box:

- The dylib exists at exactly the searched path
  (`.../rustlib/aarch64-apple-darwin/lib/libLLVM.dylib`,
   139 MB),
   and `rust-objcopy`
  loads it fine when invoked directly:
   `rust-objcopy --version` prints
  `LLVM version 22.1.6-rust-1.98.0-nightly` (exit 0,
   three consecutive runs),
   and
  a manual `rust-objcopy --strip-debug <copy>` succeeds (exit 0).
   So the tool and
  the dylib are not broken.
- The failure happens only when `cargo`/`rustc` spawns `rust-objcopy` as its strip
  sub-step.
   This is an upstream rustc-on-macOS-nightly interaction (the spawn
  context fails to resolve the same `@rpath`),
   not a defect in this repo.
   Earlier
  the `llvm-tools` component was simply absent;
   installing it
  (`rustup component add llvm-tools-preview`) made `rust-objcopy` loadable
  standalone but did NOT silence the build warning.

The warning is non-fatal:
 the build still produces the binary.

## Verification

Toolchain:
 `nightly-aarch64-apple-darwin`,
 rustc 1.98.0-nightly,
 libLLVM
22.1.6-rust-1.98.0-nightly,
 macOS 26.5.1 (arm64).

The produced binary is already stripped despite the warning:

```bash
# On ssh m1, after `cargo build --release`:
ls -la target/release/music-player          # 8,622,864 bytes (~8.6 MB)
nm target/release/music-player | wc -l      # 370  (a non-stripped release binary
                                            #       has thousands)

# A manual rust-objcopy strip of a copy removes almost nothing, confirming the
# artifact going into the redundant step is already stripped:
OBJ=~/.rustup/toolchains/nightly-aarch64-apple-darwin/lib/rustlib/aarch64-apple-darwin/bin/rust-objcopy
cp target/release/music-player /tmp/mp-copy
"$OBJ" --strip-debug /tmp/mp-copy           # exit 0
ls -la /tmp/mp-copy                         # 8,622,848 bytes (16 bytes smaller)
```

So the symbol table is already gone before the warned step runs;
 the failing
`rust-objcopy` pass is redundant on this target.
 The shipped Mach-O (and therefore
the signed `.app`) is small and stripped.

## Verified workarounds

- Do nothing.
   The warning is cosmetic on this toolchain:
   the binary builds and is
  effectively stripped.
   This is the chosen course;
   the signing pipeline is
  unaffected.
   Tradeoff:
   the warning line stays in release-build output on m1.
- If the warning must be silenced,
   update the toolchain (`rustup update nightly`,
  or reinstall `rust-std`/`llvm-tools` for the nightly).
   Tradeoff:
   it moves the
  pinned-rev Slint build onto a newer rustc;
   that build only requires rustc >= 1.92,
  so a newer nightly is compatible,
   but it is a toolchain change to make
  deliberately,
   not silently.
- Setting `strip = false` in `[profile.release]` would also remove the warning,
   but
  the Cargo.
  toml comment marks the symbol strip as wanted for size,
   and the artifact
  is already stripped here anyway,
   so this is not worth the size regression on
  non-macOS targets.

## What does not work

- `rustup component add llvm-tools-preview`:
   makes `rust-objcopy` loadable when run
  directly,
   but the `cargo`/`rustc`-spawned strip step still SIGABRTs.
   Verified on
  the box.

## Upstream filing decision

Nothing to file from this repo.
 Walking the 6-constraint check stops at the first
constraint:

1. Is it upstream's fault?
    Partly:
    it is a rustc-nightly + macOS `rust-objcopy`
   spawn-context quirk,
    not a defect in `music-player`.
    But it does not affect our
   output (the binary is stripped regardless),
    so there is no user-facing problem to
   report,
    and a fast-moving nightly is the wrong target for a bug report about a
   redundant,
    non-fatal step.
    If it ever blocks a build,
    search the rust-lang/rust
   tracker for `rust-objcopy` + `libLLVM.dylib` strip failures before filing;
    this
   class of issue has appeared there before.

Because there is no impact on the artifact,
 this doc records the diagnosis and the
"do nothing" decision rather than keeping a fileable issue draft.
