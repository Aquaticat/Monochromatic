# Seating the editor and refiner columns on the full-roster calibration

Decided 2026-08-25 from the finished 40-slice full-roster calibration,
launched 2026-08-25T01:30Z and finished in 42518 seconds, zero `[error]` lines.
Read with `~/temp/agent/standing-from-log.mjs`, whose self-test reproduces
a prior run exactly and which derives the Bonferroni critical value from the row count
rather than hardcoding one.

The owner delegated this: "You have authorization to drop models that are exceptionally bad."

## What the run measured

Two columns, scored separately, both against a ten-seat Bonferroni threshold of z = 2.81.

```text
EDITOR   114 judged rounds from 31 of 40 slices, pooled 1177/7438 = 15.82%
         3.68 rounds per contributing slice, so deflation is sqrt of that = 1.92x

REFINER   22 judged rounds from 22 of 40 slices, pooled 126/853 = 14.77%

## The refiner column carries no deflation, which is why it decides more than its size suggests

Its 22 rounds came from 22 distinct slices, exactly one each,
so the within-slice correlation that deflates the editor column by 1.92x does not exist here at all.
Twenty-two independent rounds outrank 114 correlated ones for this purpose,
because the effective sample is the count of independent slices rather than of rounds.

This corrects an alarm raised mid-run and recorded in `doc/handover/translation-repair.md`:
the refiner column looked thin and turned out to be the cleaner of the two instruments.

## Decision one: `hf:zai-org/GLM-5.2` is the first-choice writer in both columns

Best in both, and the only seat clearing on the strong side of both after deflation.
Its editor margin is not close: z 9.83 raw, 5.12 deflated, against a threshold of 2.81.

## Decision two: `hf:Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B` is a refiner before it is an editor

It clears decisively as a refiner (z 4.35, undeflated) and fails as an editor (1.97 deflated).
Where the two roles compete for one seat, it takes the refiner one.

## Decision three: the roster is NOT narrowed, and `gemma-4-26b-a4b-it` stays

It is measurably last in both columns and significantly so, z -3.45 and -2.99 after deflation.
The owner's authorization to drop exceptionally bad models would cover it on those numbers alone.
It stays anyway, for a reason the numbers do not show and the pipeline's shape does:

-   A losing candidate does not degrade the output.
    Judges choose among candidates; one that never wins costs a call and changes nothing that ships.
    "Worst" here means "least often preferred", not "harmful".
-   The cost argument is the only argument for dropping it,
    and the owner's standing guideline makes cost a non-constraint.
-   It answers cleanly: zero cut voices, zero zero-content streams, zero reasoning volume.
    It is not misbehaving, which is what "exceptionally bad" was authorized against.
-   `#136` set the precedent on `GLM-4.7-Flash` and it holds:
    a seat is not dropped for placing last on a preference measure.

WHAT WOULD CHANGE THIS: evidence that its candidates dilute judging rather than merely lose,
or that its schema mismatches (4 of the 6 in an earlier run) cost rounds the roster needed.
Neither is measured. Both are measurable, and neither is measured yet.

## What this standing is NOT

It is preference evidence only.
`doc/audit/every-volume-guard-is-blind-to-one-model.md` carries the availability evidence,
and the two must not be read as one number.
In particular `qwen3.8-max` places second here while recording 281 zero-content streams,
which is an accounting artifact of its tool-call channel and not a delivery failure.

Neither column is a verdict about model quality in general.
It measures which seat writes text these judges prefer, on this corpus, under these house rules,
at this date.
