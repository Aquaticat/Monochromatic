# Translation repair: DeepSeek and Xiaomi are called directly, each for one model

Granted by the owner on 2026-10-22.
Extends `doc/decision/translation-repair-neuralwatt-provider.md` (the fifth provider),
`doc/decision/translation-repair-openrouter-fallback.md` (OpenRouter)
and the Bedrock decision of 2026-09-07 (`package/translation-repair/doc/provider-availability.md`).
The code is in `package/translation-repair/provider/src/direct-*.ts`,
`deepseek-*.ts` and `xiaomi-*.ts`.

## Why

The owner's two grants of 2026-10-22,
quoted as the code quotes them:

- DeepSeek:
  "You can also use the DEEPSEEK_API_KEY as you wish,
  but you may only use deepseek v4.1 flash 1017 with that key."
- Xiaomi:
  "You may only use v2.6-flash with this key."

Neither key is scoped to a model by the provider,
so the restriction is held three ways in code:
the served-id types are single literals (`DeepSeekServedId`,
`XiaomiServedId` in `shared-contract/src/roster-id.ts`),
the model cards carry exactly one side each (`shared-contract/src/direct-card-sides.ts`),
and both clients throw before any request is built for any other roster model
(`DeepSeekModelNotServedError`,
`XiaomiModelNotServedError`).
`shared-contract/src/direct-cards.unit.test.ts` and `provider/src/direct-client.unit.test.ts` fail when any of the three is removed.

The roster does not change.
No model is seated in a new role and no owner hold is lifted:
the same seats are reached by one more route.

## Facts the design rests on

All read or probed on 2026-10-22 unless stated.

- DeepSeek serves `deepseek-flash` (roster seat `deepseek-v4.1-flash`) on `https://api.deepseek.com/chat/completions`.
  Its `response_format` of type `json_schema` is refused with HTTP 400,
  and `{type: 'json_object'}` is accepted
  when the word "json" is in the prompt.
  The client sends JSON mode and states the schema in the system prompt,
  whose text carries that word.
- Xiaomi serves `mimo-v2.6-flash` (roster seat `xiaomi/mimo-v2.6-flash`) on `https://api.xiaomimimo.com/v1/chat/completions`.
  It accepts `json_schema` with `strict` unchanged.
- Both put reasoning in `delta.reasoning_content`,
  which the stream reader drops,
  and both send `:` comment lines,
  which it ignores.
  Neither request carries a reasoning or thinking member for now:
  the owner's standing instruction of 2026-08-25 was lifted for NeuralWatt on 2026-10-21
  and,
  on 2026-10-22,
  for DeepSeek direct,
  Xiaomi direct and Anthropic,
  so both routes are cleared for their documented thinking parameters.
  None is sent until an effort bench has measured one,
  and a value that disables thinking is never sent.
- DeepSeek reports `system_fingerprint` on every reply.
  The client writes it on the completion log line (encoded,
  bounded) as the one per-call evidence of the build.
- Limits:
  DeepSeek documents 2,500 concurrent requests for `deepseek-flash` (HTTP 429 over),
  Xiaomi documents 100 requests a minute and 10 million tokens a minute for `mimo-v2.6-flash`.
  The DeepSeek client bounds concurrency at 2,500.
  The Xiaomi client paces every attempt,
  retries included,
  to 100 in any minute (`createRequestPace`).
- An exhausted balance answers HTTP 402 "Insufficient Balance" on both
  (`https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/error_codes`,
  `https://mimo.mi.com/docs/en-US/api/guidance/error-codes`).
  The router passes it to `markRefused` as `paymentRequired`.
- No cache key in the pipeline includes the serving provider.
  The slice,
  translate-slice and image-reading keys carry no provider,
  and `servedBy` is stored beside a replayed reply,
  not in its key,
  so a reply replays whichever route first produced it.

## Where they sit in the order

`PROVIDER_ORDER` is now NeuralWatt,
Synthetic,
Bedrock,
DeepSeek,
Xiaomi,
Hyper,
OpenRouter.
**This order is open to the owner's veto.**
The reasoning follows the Bedrock precedent:
Hyper's balance is never renewed and the Hyper-only seats run on it,
DeepSeek's prepaid balance was given to use "as you wish",
and Xiaomi bills per token and serves only the seat OpenRouter otherwise serves,
so both direct routes are tried before Hyper and OpenRouter spend money the owner tops up.
Neither is placed ahead of NeuralWatt's free daily energy.

## Meters

DeepSeek has a balance endpoint.
`GET /user/balance` is parsed strictly (`DeepSeekBalanceShapeError` for any body off the documented shape),
and the provider reads dry when `is_available` is false or the USD total is at or under `DEEPSEEK_DRY_FLOOR_USD`,
which is zero.
The floor has no margin above zero because its balance is prepaid,
one call costs at most a few cents at the peak rates the card prices,
and a balance too small for the next call surfaces as the 402 at the wire.
Bedrock alone carries a margin,
because its overshoot reaches the owner's card.

Xiaomi documents no balance or billing endpoint.
Its meter answers wet always and reports this process's priced spend,
so the `METERS` line shows `xiaomi=wet xiaomiUsdSpent=...`.
Exhaustion is learned from the 402.

Because that meter never reads dry by itself,
the run-ending stop (`EveryProviderDryError`) would never fire while Xiaomi is configured.
The router therefore reads Xiaomi as dry for the stop when the model asked is one Xiaomi does not serve
(`dryForTheModelAsked` in `budget-routing.ts`),
so a fleet that is dry except for Xiaomi still ends the run for every other model.
Only an always-wet meter gets this reading:
a provider with a real meter that is wet but does not serve the model keeps its own reading,
so a model whose serving providers are all dry is still a lost seat and not the end of the run.
The `EveryProviderDryError` text then says `xiaomi` dry for a provider whose meter is wet but useless for that call.

How the hold behaves,
in both directions (pinned in `provider-budget-xiaomi-hold.unit.test.ts`):
the budget layer clears a payment mark when the meter's level text changes,
and the level here is the run's own spend.

- With no call settling after the refusal the spend does not move,
  so a 402 holds Xiaomi dry for the rest of the process.
  This is intended:
  a 402 means the account is out of money,
  and the process cannot know that it was topped up,
  so a top-up within a run takes effect on the next launch.
- A call that was already in flight settles after the refusal and moves the spend,
  which clears the mark early and lets one more call through to meet the refusal again.
  The cost is one extra refused request per such settle.

A run without a key logs `deepseek=dry` or `xiaomi=dry` on the `METERS` line,
as every unconfigured provider does,
so the duty cycle `meter-report` prints for a provider the run never had reads as fully dry.
Logs written before today carry neither field,
and the reader (`meter-sample-read.ts`) reads them as absent.

## Keys

`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` (the owner's name,
without the package prefix) and `TRANSLATION_REPAIR_XIAOMI_MIMO_API_KEY`.
Both are optional.
An absent key leaves the provider unconfigured,
with one info line naming the variable,
printed after the no-key refusal so a launch with no key at all still prints its refusal alone.
No key falls back to another provider's.
Neither is a valid `--require-providers` value:
no arm can depend on an optional route being ready.
Both names are in the no-key error text,
the budget sample,
the roster-card tool and the tests' named cases;
the child-environment scrub and the keyless scans match the `_API_KEY` suffix,
so both are covered there without a list.

## Prices

DeepSeek is priced at peak always:
0.006 (cache hit),
0.3 (cache miss) and 1.2 (output) USD per million tokens,
with the hit and miss split read from the usage block.
The page halves every rate off peak (01:00 to 04:00 UTC and 06:00 to 10:00 UTC on weekdays other than Chinese public holidays are peak),
and a run cannot know the holidays,
so a peak price is an upper bound and never an under-read of the balance.
Xiaomi is 0.0028 (cached),
0.14 and 0.28 USD per million tokens,
with the cached count read from the usage block.

## The Xiaomi token cap

Xiaomi's chat reference lists `max_completion_tokens` and not `max_tokens`,
and the shared wire body sends `max_tokens`.
It is kept,
because it was measured on 2026-10-22 (`w287-xingz18/xiaomi-max-tokens-probe.out`):
on `mimo-v2.6-flash` with a cap of 64,
both `max_tokens` and `max_completion_tokens` returned `finish_reason` "length"
with `completion_tokens` 64 (`reasoning_tokens` 22 included).

## No zero data retention

Neither route promises zero data retention.
The owner's ruling of 2026-10-05 (the corpus is public,
PII is allowed) and the two grants are what permit it.
The OpenRouter route of Xiaomi's model sends `zdr: true` and is behind this one in the order.

## The 1017 limit

The grant names "deepseek v4.1 flash 1017".
The client cannot ask for a build:
`deepseek-flash` is the only wire id,
and the claim that it is the 1017 build rests on DeepSeek's documentation,
with `system_fingerprint` logged per call as the only evidence a reader can compare across days.
No call was made with a key to check it.

## Not done

- No real key was used and no request left the machine:
  every test runs over a recorded transport,
  and the `roster-card` listing address for Xiaomi is the OpenAI-compatible protocol's,
  not fetched.
- The rotation sweep and the gate were not run.
- The cap census maps both providers' served ids to their seats,
  but no call has been counted.
- Several of the new modules have no own test file and are on the own-unit-tests allowlist,
  reached by `direct-client.unit.test.ts`,
  `direct-parts.unit.test.ts` and `direct-providers.unit.test.ts`.
