# Page shape: semantic wrap stays per slice

Decided by the owner on 2026-09-03 ("Keep per-slice wrap"), asked with three options after the XIEPT2
reading (`doc/planning/translation-repair-xiept2-reading-2026-09-03.md`, "Shape") found the page
alternating between one-clause-per-line paragraphs and single-line paragraphs section by section.

## The rule

- Semantic wrap is applied per slice, and a line-structured slice (poems, scheduled-message blocks, anything
    whose line breaks carry meaning) is left as it stands.
- A page whose slices differ in kind therefore differs in shape across sections, and that is accepted.

## Options rejected

- Wrap the whole page one way at assembly, with fenced and line-structured blocks exempt: one convention per
    page, at the cost of touching the assembly step every page passes through, a new guard, and a re-read.
- No semantic wrap, single-line paragraphs: the archive's own convention is unmeasured, and every diff
    against the archive would become a whole-paragraph diff.

## What this changes

Nothing in code. The reading's "Shape" finding is closed by decision, and a later reading does not report it
as a defect.
