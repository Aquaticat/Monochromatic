Verbatim structured output from the 2026-06-12 `ios-framework-desk-audit` fan-out (16 parallel
source audits against the three iOS platform walls plus the kopia/music-player functional
requirements),
 with an adversarial cite-check.
 Not lint-conformed.
 On-device gate results,
 where
run,
 live in `device-gate-results.md`;
 the cross-cutting decision is in
`../ios-iphone-x-music-player-kopia-stack.md`.

## Verdict

- iOS runtime model:
   Split model.
   The Quasar app's UI is a Vue 3 single-page app that runs as JavaScript inside an out-of-process WKWebView (Apple JavaScriptCore + JIT in the WebKit "Web Content Process"),
   not in the app process.
   Quasar ships no native iOS runtime of its own:
   its iOS build mode scaffolds a standard Capacitor (`@capacitor/ios`,
   preferred) or Cordova (`cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine`,
   legacy) Xcode project and delegates to `cap` + `xcrun xcodebuild` (app-vite/lib/modes/capacitor/capacitor-builder.
  js #buildIos).
   The native app-process code is AOT-compiled Swift/ObjC (Capacitor's CAPBridge host plus any native plugins).
   So app code executes in two tiers:
   AOT-native Swift/ObjC in the app process,
   and JIT-compiled JS in the separate WKWebView content process.
- Minimum iOS deployment:
   iOS 15.0 (Capacitor's stated minimum for current major:
   capacitorjs.
  com/docs/ios requires iOS 15+ and Xcode 14+).
   The iPhone X gate device runs iOS up to 16.
  x,
   so it satisfies this.
   cpal's iOS RemoteIO/AVAudioSession backend imposes no higher floor.
- Gate expectation:
   expected-pass
- Confidence:
   high
- Key finding:
   Quasar adds no iOS runtime:
   it is a Vue-3-in-WKWebView UI layer that scaffolds a standard Capacitor/Cordova Xcode shell,
   so every wall is decided by the Capacitor substrate,
   not by Quasar.
   Wall 2 is structurally satisfied (UI JS JITs in the out-of-process WKWebView content process,
   app-process code is AOT Swift/ObjC),
   and wall 1 plus all four functional requirements (kopia staticlib,
   in-app HTTP server,
   HTTPS/background transfer,
   and the music-player's symphonia+cpal Rust core,
   which cpal 0.18 outputs to iOS via a real RemoteIO/AVAudioSession CoreAudio backend) collapse to a single mechanism:
   a native Capacitor Swift plugin linking a C/Rust/Go static lib via CocoaPods/SPM and bridging to JS.
   The cost is a double bridge (JS<->Swift<->Rust) and a full Slint-to-Vue UI rewrite for the player,
   but no audio rewrite onto AVAudioEngine.

## Wall 2: JIT / executable memory

Verdict:
 wkwebview-jit

Quasar's UI logic is JavaScript,
 and it relies on JIT,
 but that JIT runs in the out-of-process WKWebView Web Content Process,
 which is the one process Apple grants the dynamic-codesigning (JIT) entitlement.
 No JIT or W^X violation occurs in the app process:
 Capacitor's host and any native plugins are AOT Swift/ObjC.
 This is the iOS-favorable mirror image of the NativeScript-on-Android DENY_EXECMEM problem;
 here the scripted UI is structurally quarantined in the allowed process.
 WKWebView's multi-process architecture (separate Web Content Process running the JS engine + JIT,
 IPC to the app process) is documented by Apple,
 and Capacitor explicitly uses WKWebView (not UIWebView).

## Wall 1: link and call a Go/Rust static library

Feasible:
 yes

Mechanism:
 Not provided by Quasar;
 inherited from the Capacitor substrate.
 A Capacitor iOS plugin is a Swift class extending CAPPlugin + CAPBridgedPlugin that registers methods (pluginMethods array of CAPPluginMethod) exposed to JS over the CAPBridge (CAPPluginCall.
resolve/reject).
 That Swift plugin links a Rust/Go/C static library or XCFramework as a normal Xcode dependency declared via CocoaPods (.
podspec s.
dependency) or Swift Package Manager (Package.
swift),
 then calls it through the Swift/ObjC -> C FFI.
 kopia ships as a gomobile c-archive .
xcframework (or a Rust staticlib);
 the plugin calls it and surfaces results to the Vue UI over the JS bridge.
 Note this is a two-hop path:
 JS <-> Swift (Capacitor bridge) and Swift <-> Rust/Go (C FFI).

js (xcodebuild of the generated App.
xcworkspace)

## Wall 3: background execution

Inherited from the Capacitor/iOS substrate;
 no long-running foreground service exists.
 A multi-hour kopia snapshot cannot run as a continuous task and must be restructured around background URLSession (out-of-process uploads/downloads to pCloud that survive suspension) plus BGProcessingTask (short,
 idle/charging windows) driven from a native Capacitor plugin.
 The WKWebView/JS layer cannot keep work alive in the background;
 the transfer must live in the Swift plugin calling URLSession background sessions and BGTaskScheduler.
 Quasar contributes nothing here and adds nothing that changes it.

 Apple iOS background execution model (URLSession background configuration + BGTaskScheduler/BGProcessingTask);
 Capacitor native-plugin mechanism per capacitorjs.
com/docs/plugins/ios.
 No Quasar source touches background execution (grep of app-vite found only WKWebView/build delegation).

## In-app HTTP server (kopia S3 target)

Feasible:
 yes

Mechanism:
 Not in the WebView;
 in a native Capacitor plugin.
 The in-app S3/HTTP endpoint kopia targets is run by Swift/ObjC native code (e.g. an embedded HTTP server library or the Go/Rust static lib's own listener bound to 127.0.0.1) inside the app process,
 exposed to JS only for control.
 The Vue UI cannot host a socket server itself;
 it orchestrates the native plugin over the CAPBridge.

Source:
 capacitorjs.
com/docs/plugins/ios (native plugin runs arbitrary Swift/ObjC + linked C/Rust/Go code in-process);
 substrate capability,
 not a Quasar feature

## HTTPS streaming client (pCloud)

Feasible:
 yes

Mechanism:
 Two valid paths,
 both via the substrate.
 (1) Native:
 a Capacitor plugin uses URLSession (incl.
 background URLSession for the streaming/resumable transfer to pCloud),
 which is the correct path for multi-GB streamed uploads.
 (2) WebView:
 fetch/XHR/WebSocket from the Vue layer works for foreground requests but cannot stream in the background and is subject to WKWebView networking.
 For kopia-to-pCloud the native URLSession path is required.
 Note Quasar's Cordova mode injects a CDVWKWebViewEngine TLS-trust override (accepts server trust unconditionally),
 which is a security smell to avoid in the production HTTPS-to-pCloud path.

 /tmp/agent/quasar-audit-20260612/app-vite/lib/modes/cordova/config-file.
js:
160-210 (#prepareWkWebEngine injects didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge accepting serverTrust);
 capacitorjs.
com/docs/plugins/ios (native plugin -> URLSession)

## Audio (music-player port)

Decode:
 symphonia 0.6 (all features) + libopus decode runs unchanged as Rust inside a native plugin's linked static lib;
 pure CPU/no platform API,
 reused via FFI.

Output:
 cpal 0.18 has a real iOS CoreAudio backend that uses RemoteIO Audio Units + AVAudioSession for output.
 The output stream is driven by RemoteIO AudioUnit render callbacks;
 the host module is cfg-gated for non-macOS Apple targets (iOS/tvOS).
 So cpal output is reused on iOS via FFI;
 no AVAudioEngine rewrite is required for audio output.
 Low-latency output is achievable through RemoteIO.
 Always-on true-peak normalization + on-disk peak cache are pure Rust and reuse unchanged.

Rust core reuse:
 Reused via FFI,
 NOT rewritten on AVAudioEngine.
 The entire Rust core (symphonia decode + libopus + true-peak normalization + peak cache + cpal RemoteIO output) is kept behind a Capacitor native plugin and called through Swift<->Rust C FFI.
 What does NOT carry over is the Slint UI:
 the player's UI is a from-scratch rewrite in Vue/Quasar,
 and the Rust core is reached through two bridges (JS<->Swift Capacitor bridge,
 then Swift<->Rust C FFI).
 So 'reuse' means the audio/business core reuses;
 the app itself is a UI rewrite,
 not a port of the Slint app.
 The Slint master-rev pin with winit/femtovg/software renderers is irrelevant on this stack since rendering becomes WKWebView/Vue.

## Gate probe and toolchain

Minimal app:
 scaffold a Quasar Capacitor app (quasar dev/build -m capacitor -T ios),
 add one native Capacitor plugin (Swift CAPPlugin) that links a trivial Rust staticlib/XCFramework exporting a C function (e.g. returns a number or echoes a string over FFI),
 register one pluginMethod,
 and call it from a Vue page.
 Build the generated App.
xcworkspace with xcodebuild,
 sign,
 install on the iPhone X.
 Exact on-device signal:
 the Vue WebView renders the value returned by the Rust FFI round-trip (JS -> CAPBridge -> Swift -> Rust staticlib -> back),
 proving wall 1 (link + call a native static lib from app code) on a real device.
 Wall 2 needs no probe:
 the UI JS JITs in the WKWebView content process by construction.
 Optional second probe:
 have the plugin start a 127.0.0.1 HTTP listener and a background URLSession to confirm the kopia-app substrate paths.

Toolchain:
 macOS with Xcode (>= 14,
 iOS 15+ SDK per Capacitor) + Command Line Tools;
 CocoaPods (and/or SPM,
 built into Xcode);
 Node.
js + a package manager (pnpm/npm) with @quasar/cli and @quasar/app-vite;
 @capacitor/cli + @capacitor/ios;
 Rust toolchain with the aarch64-apple-ios target (rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios) plus cargo-lipo or cbindgen / `cargo build --target aarch64-apple-ios` to produce the staticlib/XCFramework;
 for kopia,
 the Go toolchain with gomobile to emit the c-archive .
xcframework.

## Supporting-stack vets this framework drags in

- Capacitor iOS substrate vet (CAPBridge host,
   plugin registration,
   app lifecycle) since Quasar contributes no native runtime
- Native plugin authoring + C FFI binding vet:
   Swift CAPPlugin <-> Rust/Go staticlib (cbindgen/gomobile,
   memory ownership across the JS<->Swift<->Rust double bridge,
   threading off the JS thread)
- In-app local HTTP/S3 server inside a native plugin (kopia target endpoint)
- HTTPS streaming + background URLSession + BGProcessingTask transfer to pCloud (multi-hour snapshot restructuring;
   avoid the Cordova-mode TLS-trust override)
- Audio vet:
   symphonia/libopus decode + true-peak normalization Rust core behind FFI,
   cpal RemoteIO output latency/glitch behavior on device,
   AVAudioSession category/interruption handling
- QA vets:
   in-process WebView UI test (Vue Test Utils / Vitest at unit,
   Cypress/Playwright or Capacitor's WebDriver for e2e on device),
   native-plugin Swift unit tests (XCTest),
   Rust core property/fuzz/mutation tests at the FFI boundary,
   and adversarial boundary tests for the JS<->native marshaling (CAPPluginCall getString/getObject) and the in-app HTTP endpoint

## Adversarial cite-check

- Wall 2 confirmed:
   not-confirmed
- Wall 1 confirmed:
   confirmed
- Corrections:
   WALL-2 (load-bearing citation gap):
   The pillar of the "wkwebview-jit" verdict is the parenthetical attributed to Apple's WKWebView class-reference page (developer.
  apple.
  com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview),
   namely that the "out-of-process Web Content Process runs JS JIT".
   I rendered the full page (WebFetch returned only the title because the page is a JS-rendered SPA,
   so I captured the rendered DOM text via agent-browser).
   The page contains ZERO occurrences of "out-of-process",
   "Web Content Process",
   "content process",
   "JIT",
   "just-in-time",
   or "separate process".
   The single "entitlement" hit is unrelated (the com.
  apple.
  developer.
  web-browser entitlement for the share-sheet "Add to Home Screen" feature).
   The page only describes WKWebView as "a platform-native view... [that] presents HTML,
   CSS,
   and JavaScript content alongside your app's native views";
   it says nothing about process isolation or where JIT executes.
   Classification:
   NOT-CONFIRMED,
   not contradicted (the page does not assert the reverse;
   it is simply silent on the multi-process/JIT architecture).
   Because the verdict's central mechanism (JIT structurally quarantined in the allowed Web Content Process,
   no JIT/W^X in the app process) rests entirely on this one citation,
   and the other two wall-2 citations only establish peripheral facts (Capacitor uses WKWebView-not-UIWebView;
   the Cordova engine plugin name),
   the wall-2 verdict is not supported by its cited sources as written.
   Locating a valid Apple source that actually documents the WKWebView out-of-process/JIT architecture (e.g. a WWDC session or WebKit security doc) was outside the scope of this cite-check;
   I do not assert such a source here,
   only that the CITED page does not support the claim.
   WALL-1 (minor over-specification,
   verdict stands):
   capacitorjs.
  com/docs/plugins/ios supports the core mechanism (a Swift class extending CAPPlugin + CAPBridgedPlugin,
   a pluginMethods array of CAPPluginMethod,
   CAPPluginCall resolve/reject,
   and .
  podspec s.
  dependency / Package.
  swift dependency declaration).
   The page does NOT specifically describe linking C/Rust/Go static libraries or XCFrameworks;
   that is a true,
   standard Xcode/CocoaPods/SPM capability extrapolated by the audit,
   not quoted from the doc.
   This is extrapolation,
   not fabrication,
   and does not flip the wall-1 verdict.
   Repo-path citations both verified accurate:
