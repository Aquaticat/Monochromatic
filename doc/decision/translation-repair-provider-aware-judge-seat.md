# Judge seats follow the provider that would serve them

Decided by the owner on 2026-09-03 ("Seat per provider reach"), in answer to the question the
morning's drop of Qwen3.8-27B raised. Landed in `package/module/translation-repair/src/corpus-run/run-seats.ts`.

## The evidence

- Served by Hyper, `hf:Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B` reasons past the 60 s round window in every judge role:
  cut in 30 of 34 translate-lane and 21 of 24 consolidation-slate select rounds on XIEPT2 with Hyper the
  only provider (2026-09-03), and on Carena0442 (1,648 of 1,938 calls on Hyper) in 14 of 19 and 11 of 19
  select, 13 of 25 critic, 15 of 19 panel, 17 of 19 lane-contest and 7 of 14 consolidation-gate rounds.
- Served by Synthetic (Toka_ls, 2026-09-02) it answered 25 of 28 select rounds.
- So the seat is lost to one provider's serving speed, not to the model. Dropping it outright
  (`4ad08d5dc`, the morning's answer under the standing authorisation to drop a model on evidence) threw
  away a judge Synthetic serves well.

## The rule

- `HYPER_SLOW_JUDGES` names the judges Hyper serves too slowly for the window: Qwen3.8-27B today.
- Before each phase of an entry (lanes, lane contest, consolidation; once per entry until 2026-09-03),
  `readJudgeSeats` reads Synthetic's meter through the routed client's quota surface
  and derives the benches: with Synthetic dry the Hyper-slow judges are withheld from the wide seats
  (critics, panel, both lanes' select judges) and the late seats (lane contest, consolidation slate,
  consolidation gate); with Synthetic wet they sit. The static benches in `run-config.ts` are the
  Synthetic-wet ones: seven wide seats (quorum 4) and eight late judges; six (quorum 3) and seven when dry.
- An unreadable meter seats the full bench: it is not evidence of dryness, and a seat asked in vain
  costs one cut where a seat withheld on a guess costs a voice.
- `HYPER_SLOW_SELECT_JUDGES` names the judges Hyper serves too slowly in the select role alone
  (Kimi-K3 since 2026-09-03): withheld from both lanes' slate select seats and the consolidation slate
  while Synthetic is dry, kept as critic, panel, lane-contest judge and gate. Evidence: cut in 0 of 69
  select rounds served by Synthetic (Toka_ls, 2026-09-02) and in 43 of 83 and 38 of 101 with Hyper
  serving most or all of them (XIEPT2 rerun5, where 55 of its 61 cut streams were Hyper-served, and
  the postscript run), against 0 and 1 of 28 lane-contest rounds, 0 of 9 critic, 0 to 1 of 5 panel and
  0 of 14 gate rounds; its cut streams averaged 71 s, its answers 14 s.
  Same evidence bar as the owner's standing authorisation to drop a model from a role. The dry benches
  are then five select judges (quorum 3) beside six wide seats, and six slate judges beside seven late.
- Writer seats are untouched: translator, checker, introduced-defect probe, pairing and insertion
  admission keep the roster.

## What this cannot do

- The router chooses per call: Synthetic first until the model's per-model concurrency is taken, then
  Hyper. With Synthetic wet a burst could overflow some of this seat's calls to Hyper, and those may
  be cut; the seat follows the state that decides most calls, not each call. Measured on keyword233
  at overlap 4 (2026-09-03, `~/temp/agent/keyword233-seats-20260903`): none did, every Qwen call went
  to Synthetic.
- Synthetic serves the seat slowly too, only less often: on that run it was cut from 5 of 21 judge
  rounds on Synthetic (67 to 85 seconds of reasoning), against 30 of 34 and 21 of 24 on Hyper. The
  seat buys 16 answers in 21 there; the rule does not make it a fast judge.
- One reading per entry is too coarse for a long entry. XIEPT2 the same day read wet at 08:16, Synthetic
  ran dry at 08:19, and the seat sat on Hyper for three and a half hours: abandoned in 102 judge calls,
  75 rounds at the full 60 s grace, consolidation 134 minutes for 28 slices
  (`~/temp/agent/xiept2-postscript-20260903`). The meter is now read again before the lane contest and
  before consolidation, so a seat given at the lanes is withdrawn once Synthetic is dry.
- The Synthetic-wet path ran live the same day, at 1.5% of the weekly meter: `JUDGE SEATS
  synthetic=wet wide=7 late=8 hyper-slow seated=yes`, the rounds heard 7 of 7 thirteen times and 8 of
  8 six times.

## Rejected alternatives

- Leave the seat dropped: simplest, loses the judge in Synthetic weeks.
- Also drop Kimi-K3 under the same rule for every judge role: it is cut in a majority of select rounds
  on Hyper but in 0 or 1 of 28 lane-contest rounds and almost never as critic, panel or gate, so the
  whole-bench rule would throw away seats Hyper serves well. Superseded on 2026-09-03 by the select-only
  rule (`HYPER_SLOW_SELECT_JUDGES`), once the per-role counts were measured.
- A longer window for Hyper-served seats: reverses the owner's 2026-09-02 choice of the seat over the
  window, and under a 1,000-an-hour window the request, not the second, is scarce.

## Three providers, 2026-09-03

OpenRouter joined as the third provider (`doc/decision/translation-repair-openrouter-fallback.md`),
so "Synthetic dry" stopped being the whole question: with Hyper dry too, a shared seat's calls go to
OpenRouter, where Hyper's serving speed is not the reason to withhold anything.
`readJudgeSeats` therefore reads the router's own dryness view over every provider and asks, per seat,
which provider would take its calls (`providerServing`, the first in `PROVIDER_ORDER` that serves the
model and reads wet).
The Hyper-slow rules above apply where that provider is Hyper; the owner's cost decision on Kimi-K3
applies where it is OpenRouter, with gemma seated as the substitute checker.
Qwen3.8-27B is seated when OpenRouter would serve it: its chat-completions median there sat in the band
of the other models on the probe, unlike its Hyper serving, and a pass with Synthetic dry is where
that is checked on corpus-sized prompts. The first pass with OpenRouter in the order (keyword233,
2026-09-03 16:38 UTC) did not check it: Synthetic stayed wet and served every Qwen call.

## Where the evidence lives

- `doc/planning/translation-repair-roster-calibration-2026-09-01.md`: the cut counts per seat and
  round kind, split by lane.
- `doc/decision/translation-repair-roster-seating-2026-09-01.md`: the 2026-09-02 and 2026-09-03
  addenda this supersedes in part.
