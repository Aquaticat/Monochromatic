# The recovery round re-asks with the complaint appended

Decided by the owner on 2026-09-03 ("Re-ask with the guard's complaint quoted"), asked with three options
on issue 473.

## The conflict the question named

- The uniqueness rule (`prompt-uniqueness-client.ts`): one model, one completed prompt, never sampled twice;
    a repeat is served from memory. Deliberate, privacy- and spend-motivated.
- The recovery rule (`stage-quorum.ts`): an answer that arrived but could not be read is re-asked once,
    measured on 2026-08-25 as the cheap half of 36 losses (13 answered badly, 23 were silence).
- Together they made the recovery round a no-op: five recovery rounds over two passes on 2026-09-02 were
    answered from the cache with the same unreadable bytes in 0 to 1 ms.

## The rule

- The recovery round sends a different prompt: the original messages plus a complaint naming what happened
    and what to do (`RECOVERY_NUDGE`). The digest is new, so uniqueness holds, and the re-ask carries
    information the first ask did not.
- The complaint is general, not the guard's own words: every stage guard is a type predicate and carries no
    message. Where a guard grows a message, the complaint quotes it; nothing here forbids that.
- One round, never a ladder, as before.

## Options rejected

- Delete the round and answer the gemma item by a guard reading or a drop: throws away the measured
    recoverable half.
- Leave the no-op: a round that logs "recovery" while recovering nothing misleads every later reading.

## What landed

- `6323f05d8` (2026-09-02) built the re-ask with the complaint appended, ahead of the decision, and the
    decision ratifies it.
- 2026-09-03: the round logs `<stage>: recovery round heard N of M re-asked voices`, so a run log says
    whether the round earns its call.
- Measured the same day on the keyword233 passes that ran recovery rounds (pairing each round's line with
    its stage's next `round: x/N heard`): 5 of 11 re-asked voices came back readable, none served from the
    cache. The misses were one endpoint answering unreadably twice (MiniMax on Parasail, since ignored).
    The round earns its call; issue 473 closed on this.

## Where the evidence lives

- Issue 473, with the five measured no-op rounds.
- `doc/planning/translation-repair-openrouter-2026-09-03.md` for the pass that first carries the count.
