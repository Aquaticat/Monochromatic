# Retire superseded pi models by re-registering providers at session start

## Context

Pi 1.0.0 gives an extension no way to hide or refuse a model.
`enabledModels` sets the picker's default view only, and one Tab keystroke shows the full
catalog again (`dist/modes/interactive/components/model-selector.js:39,52,119,201-219`).
`model_select` has no result channel, and `AgentSession.setModel` assigns the new model
before emitting (`dist/core/extensions/types.d.ts:1179`,
`dist/core/agent-session.js:1910-1926`).
Extensions cannot write settings, because `pi.getSettings()` returns a clone
(`dist/core/settings-manager.js:305-307`).

The catalog carries no age metadata either: 1604 bundled entries across 42 providers, with
no per-model release date, deprecation flag, or version field
(`pi-ai/dist/types.d.ts:900-912`).
On this machine the live list held 525 rows across 10 providers, and the hand-maintained
`enabledModels` allow-list had already drifted twice.

Two goals were settled before design: shrink the picker, and stop a superseded model being
chosen on a path nobody watches.
Evidence, measurements, and rejected options are in
`doc/planning/pi-model-retirement.md`; the pi behavior itself is traced in
`doc/troubleshooting/pi-extension-model-catalog.md`.

## Decision

One package, `package/pi-plugin/model-retirement`, filters the catalog at `session_start`,
the earliest point an extension can read it, by re-registering each affected provider with
the models it keeps.

Filtering picks a mechanism per provider. Where `getRegisteredProviderConfig` returns a
configuration, the pass registers a configuration carrying every kept model of all three
types, because `ModelRegistry.getAll()` reports chat models only; pi merges defined values
over the previous registration, so that owner's `apiKey`, `oauth`, and `streamSimple`
survive. Everywhere else the pass wraps the composed provider from `getProvider` and
registers the wrapper, which spreads the original object and replaces only its model
listing. Wrapping needs no endpoint metadata, loses no model field, and filters live, so a
catalog refresh is filtered on the next read.

A provider is skipped only when pi exposes neither a configuration nor a composed provider
for it.

Retirement is decided from model ids alone.
A family is one provider, one API, and one name shape, where the name shape is every
non-version token in id order.
A token counts as version evidence only when its digits run to the end, optionally behind a
`v` or an alphabetic prefix, so `qwen3.8` splits into `qwen` and `3.8` while `70b`, `a12b`,
and `4o` stay words.
Ordering compares version components, then applies three tie rules: components whose raw
digit lengths differ by two or more are incommensurable, all-date extras mark a pinned
snapshot that loses to its rolling alias, and all-version extras mark a point release that
beats its base version.
Anything the id text cannot order is left alone, and an entry with no version token is never
retired.

The package writes no pi settings, offers no runtime override, applies no context-window
guard, and logs every retirement plus one warning per provider it cannot filter.

A provider is skipped, with a warning, when pi lists it as extension-registered but returns
no configuration for it, or when any of its models resolves neither an `api` nor a
`baseUrl` counting provider-level fallbacks.
Each registration is isolated, so one failure cannot abort the pass.

## Alternatives

Generate `enabledModels` from policy and let pi's native scope hide models.
Rejected: the native scope does not hide, as the `model-selector.js` trace shows.

Veto selection through an event result.
Rejected: no such contract exists in pi 1.0.0.

`unregisterProvider` for providers nobody selects from.
Rejected by the scope decision, which limited the work to within-family supersession.
It remains the cheapest clutter lever if that decision is revisited: removing `openrouter`
alone would drop 399 rows, and no installed package references it.

Virtual-model `route()` throw as the block.
Rejected: it fires only for ids the extension registers as virtual.

Age-based retirement.
Rejected: no per-model date exists in the catalog.

Ordering via `compareVersions` in `@monochromatic-dev/pi-shared-model-selection`.
Rejected on measurement: its documented alias-wins tiebreak retired `radius/claude-opus-5-5`
in favor of `radius/claude-opus-5`, inverting three point releases on a provider in daily
use.
That helper also treats 4-digit snapshots as versions, takes only the first digit run of a
token, and discards leading zeros.

Rebuilding configurations for every provider, with no wrapper path.
Rejected on measurement: it left four of thirty-nine providers unfiltered, because pi
throws when a model definition resolves no `baseUrl`, which is true of all 44
`azure-openai-responses` chat models, and returns no configuration for a provider another
extension registered as a native object, which is how `hyper`, `openai-fast`, and
`openai-codex-fast` appear.

A curated `keep` list for known false positives.
Rejected in favor of abstention, which needs no curation and errs toward keeping models.

Filtering in the extension factory.
Rejected as impossible: the factory argument exposes no catalog read at all.

## Consequences

Measured in the real host after installation: chat models 1677 to 1080, 597 retirements
across all 39 providers with retirements, no provider skipped, image 57 and classifier 15
unchanged, `azure-openai-responses` filtered through the wrapper path, `radius` keeping
`streamSimple`, `synthetic` keeping its credentials, and no `extension_error` record.
The disposable host confirms `openai-codex/gpt-6-luna` keeps its overridden 750000 context
window through filtering.

`models.json` overrides cannot be lost by re-registration, because pi applies them after
extension model replacement (`dist/core/provider-composer.js:337-353`).

Accepted costs:

- `pi --list-models` fires no extension event, so it keeps printing the unfiltered catalog.
- Startup model resolution precedes the filter, so a session can start on a retired model
  and keeps running on it; the pass warns and does not switch.
- Per-model `headers` are dropped on the configuration path, because
  `extensionModelFromDefinition` sets them to `undefined`. The wrapper path preserves them
  by passing model objects through by reference. In the bundled catalog only
  `github-copilot` and `nvidia` carry per-model headers, and neither is in the live set.
- A catalog refresh mid-session is filtered on the next read for wrapped providers, but a
  configuration-registered provider keeps its snapshot until the next session start, since
  pi exposes no model-changed event.
- With no override, a wrong retirement is recoverable only by rebuilding or removing the
  package.

Regression protection: a characterization test pins the full 551-row retirement table over
the bundled catalog, so a pi upgrade that changes any retirement fails until the diff is
reviewed and the fixture is regenerated with
`mise run //package/pi-plugin/model-retirement:fixture:retirement-table`.
Pi's extension API carries no stability guarantee and its changelog records 59 breaking
changes, so that fixture and the two verification tasks are the early-warning system.

Still open, recorded in `doc/planning/pi-model-retirement.md`: whether `radius` belongs in
scope given it serves advisor and MCP rather than interactive picks, whether `hyper`'s owner
should register a configuration pi can return so that provider takes the configuration path
too, and whether the fixture should also record the pi and pi-ai versions it was generated
against.
