## Context

The incumbent project JavaScript rule opens TypeScript 7.0.2 through `typescript/unstable/sync`.
Its cold 13-file package run took 62.9 seconds because `buildEffectSummaryIndex` eagerly indexed
337 non-declaration sources from an 834-source semantic project.
The same command completed in 1.0 second with a valid warm cache.
Disabling only the project rule while keeping Oxlint type-aware and type-check analysis completed in 396 milliseconds.

A standalone `openSemanticFile` probe completed project opening in 181.7 milliseconds on the current Linux host.
That isolates whole-project effect-summary construction,
rather than semantic-project startup,
as the demonstrated cold path.
The canonical measurements are in
`doc/troubleshooting/oxlint-prefer-readonly-incremental-cache.md`.

The requested architecture must not recover speed by trusting handwritten external-effect catalogs.
An unresolved effect must be derived,
contained by a verified isolation boundary,
or reported as opaque.

## Hard constraints

- Complete the exact 13-file package lint within 10 seconds with cold or invalidated state.
- Fail closed when parameter-reachable effects cannot be derived or isolated.
- Preserve required TypeScript 7 semantic behavior and the existing rule corpus.
- Avoid handwritten external-effect catalogs.
- Keep the implementation as an Oxlint rule.
- Do not fork or contribute to Oxlint or `tsgolint`.
- Support repository Linux x64,
  macOS arm64,
  and Windows x64 lint hosts.
- Keep native and prebuilt source-to-artifact provenance inspectable.

## Components and overlays

Every candidate is an inspectable open-source local technology or a project-owned custom implementation.
The active overlays are:

- incumbent dependency replacement;
- high-trust linter and CI execution;
- native or prebuilt artifact;
- multi-platform delivery.

### Repository incumbent and parallel systems

- repository search for `napi`,
  `oxc_semantic`,
  `typescript-go`,
  and `tsgo` in manifests and source;
- `doc/troubleshooting/typescript-7-unstable-sync-readonly.md`;
- `doc/troubleshooting/oxlint-js-plugin-lazy-child-enomem.md`;
- `doc/troubleshooting/oxlint-prefer-readonly-incremental-cache.md`.

Expansion terms discovered during the initial schedule:

- `tsgolint` direct TypeScript-Go rules;
- `ttsc` TypeScript-Go contributor rules;
- `Oxc type-aware linting`;
- `STC abandoned`.

Expansion queries:

- `typescript-go custom linter rule plugin in process Go tsgolint extension`
- `Oxc Rust TypeScript type checker complete parity TypeScript Go alternative`
- `stc Rust TypeScript type checker repository maintenance archived status`

The query schedule is frozen after this expansion round.

## Query ledger

The web provider returned the following visible result counts:

- Oxc custom native-rule query: 10 results.
- Oxc JavaScript-plugin query: 10 results.
- Rust TypeScript-checker query: 10 results.
- NAPI-RS concurrency query: 10 results.
- TypeScript-Go API query: 10 results.
- Rust checker and STC query: 10 results.
- Node-API binding alternatives query: 10 results.
- Oxlint plus Node-API query: 10 results.
- crates.io Node-API query: 10 results.
- GitHub Node-API topic query: no provider output.
- npm `oxlint-tsgolint` query: 10 results.
- TypeScript-Go custom-linter query: 10 results.
- Oxc checker-parity query: 10 results.
- STC maintenance query: 10 results.
- NAPI-RS versus Neon query: 10 results.
- `node-bindgen` query: 10 results.

The searches discovered NAPI-RS,
Neon,
`node-bindgen`,
`node_api`,
Oxc,
STC,
`tsgolint`,
and `ttsc`.
STC exits because its repository is archived and its tracker declares the project abandoned.
Low-level or older Node-API crates do not change the architecture question:
they supply a bridge,
not TypeScript semantics.

## Candidate ledger

### Demand-driven incumbent TypeScript sync bridge

Discovery source:
repository implementation and incremental-cache incident.

Base category:
project-owned custom implementation.

Screening:
selected and implemented.
It preserves the semantic corpus,
platform behavior,
and supported Oxlint JavaScript-plugin boundary.
Demand-driven traversal replaced eager whole-project summary construction.

### Rust Node-API hybrid

Discovery source:
user proposal,
NAPI-RS,
Neon,
Node-API documentation,
and repository Oxc integration.

Base category:
project-owned custom native implementation using an inspectable bridge framework.

Screening:
serious alternative only as a hybrid.
Rust can own parsing,
effect graph construction,
fixed-point propagation,
hashing,
and certificate validation.
TypeScript-Go must still provide semantic facts unless a replacement checker proves parity.

### Pure Rust analyzer on Oxc

Discovery source:
Oxc repository and official docs.

Base category:
inspectable open-source local technology plus project-owned analyzer.

Screening:
exited on semantic compatibility.
Current Oxc `oxc_type_checker` source explicitly says it performs no type checking.
Oxc JavaScript plugins also do not receive type-aware APIs.

### Project-owned native Oxlint fork

Discovery source:
Oxc source and contributor documentation.

Base category:
project-owned fork of inspectable open-source local technology.

Screening:
exited on the project-governance constraint.
Oxc provides JavaScript plugins for external rules;
its contributor docs say the project does not plan new Rust-based plugins.
A project rule in native Rust therefore requires a custom Oxlint build,
which this project will neither maintain nor propose upstream.
It also lacks TypeScript-Go checker parity unless a second semantic boundary is added.

### Project-owned `tsgolint` fork

Discovery source:
Oxlint type-aware documentation and `oxc-project/tsgolint` source.

Base category:
project-owned fork of inspectable open-source local technology.

Screening:
exited on the project-governance constraint.
It runs Go rules directly against TypeScript-Go AST and checker objects,
shares the program used by Oxlint type-aware linting,
and integrates through `OXLINT_TSGOLINT_PATH`.
It has no dynamic custom-rule API;
adding this project rule requires a fork or upstream contribution,
and this project will do neither.
Its 396-millisecond rule-disabled baseline remains useful evidence for checker-local execution.

### `ttsc` contributor rule

Discovery source:
expansion search for TypeScript-Go custom lint rules.

Base category:
inspectable open-source local technology plus a project-owned Go contributor rule.

Screening:
serious alternative pending validation.
`@ttsc/lint` exposes a public contributor API,
a `TypeAwareRule` marker,
and a project-rule surface over the in-process TypeScript-Go checker.
It is a separate lint host rather than Oxlint's existing `tsgolint` backend,
so consumer integration may duplicate TypeScript program setup.
Its contributor binary build and cache behavior must be included in the 10-second cold measurement.
"Contributor rule" is `ttsc` API terminology:
project rule source would remain in this repository and would not be contributed to Oxlint or `tsgolint`.

### STC

Discovery source:
Rust TypeScript checker expansion search.

Base category:
inspectable open-source local technology.

Screening:
exited because `dudykr/stc` is archived and issue 1101 states that the project is officially abandoned.

## Source evidence

### Node-API is a transport and ABI boundary

Node.js documentation classifies Node-API as stable and ABI-stable across Node.js versions.
It exposes native functions to JavaScript,
but it does not provide TypeScript AST or checker semantics.
NAPI-RS documentation says an ordinary synchronous `#[napi] fn` runs on the JavaScript thread.
Its asynchronous forms return promises or complete later on the JavaScript thread.

That matters because Oxlint's JavaScript `lintFile` callback is synchronous.
Oxc
`apps/oxlint/src/js_plugins/external_linter.rs:151-198`
routes the callback through a `ThreadsafeFunction` to the main JavaScript thread,
then blocks the originating Rust worker on `rx.recv()`.
A synchronous native addon can make work inside that callback faster,
but it cannot make Oxlint await an asynchronous result.

Outcome:
Node-API removes JavaScript execution cost only for work fully moved into native code.
It does not remove eager scope,
TypeScript checker RPC,
or the main-thread callback serialization by itself.

### Pure Oxc cannot preserve the current semantic contract

At revision `90b8fd143c0085f3fb2d47344c578e23ccc33da7`,
`crates/oxc_type_checker/src/lib.rs:3-6` says:

```rust
//! An **experimental**, work-in-progress type checker for JavaScript and TypeScript.
//!
//! This crate is intentionally a thin scaffold. It does *not* type check anything yet.
```

The crate is unpublished,
and its visitor performs an empty walk.
Oxc's official JavaScript-plugin documentation also lists
"Lint rules that rely on TypeScript type-awareness"
as unsupported.

Outcome:
a pure Rust Oxc rewrite fails the semantic compatibility hard gate today.

### External native Oxlint rules require a fork

Oxc's official contributor guide says:

> Since ESLint-compatible JavaScript plugin support is now available,
> we do not plan to add new Rust-based plugins.

The supported external configuration surface is `jsPlugins`.
The Rust `Rule` registry is generated into the Oxlint binary.
No dynamic external Rust-rule loader was found in the audited source.

Outcome:
a native Oxlint implementation is a maintained custom distribution,
not a loadable project plugin.

### `tsgolint` runs beside the TypeScript-Go checker

At revision `744b737d9743274217b01a54f5ff51bd6857da48`,
`internal/rule/rule.go:118-127` gives each rule the direct TypeScript Program and Checker:

```go
type RuleContext struct {
    SourceFile  *ast.SourceFile
    Program     *compiler.Program
    TypeChecker *checker.Checker
```

`internal/linter/linter.go:464-598` distributes target source files through checker-backed worker queues.
The existing `prefer_readonly_parameter_types` rule directly queries mapped readonly flags,
properties,
arrays,
tuples,
unions,
and intersections.

The architecture avoids the JavaScript sync API's per-operation JSON RPC.
It also avoids a TypeScript-to-ESTree conversion.
The current project measurement with its JavaScript rule disabled shows
that the existing Oxlint type-aware and type-check path completes the 13-file workload in 396 milliseconds.
That measurement does not include the proposed effect engine.

Outcome:
Go code beside TypeScript-Go is the strongest measured native direction,
but a project-owned `tsgolint` fork carries release and merge maintenance.

### `ttsc` has a supported custom TypeScript-Go rule boundary

At revision `017b4d808689f57d4e30391844ab897e5f9f3dce`,
`packages/lint/rule/rule.go` defines public contributor rules over TypeScript-Go AST and checker objects.
Its `TypeAwareRule` marker explicitly selects the live checker path.
The project also exposes project-scoped contributor rules whose state can be reused by file rules in one Program cycle.

Contributor source is statically linked into a generated plugin binary.
That is favorable for checker locality,
but the cold latency test must count its binary generation and cache behavior.
The project publishes Linux,
Darwin,
and Windows packages for x64 and arm64,
and its CI includes Ubuntu,
macOS,
and Windows lanes.

Outcome:
`ttsc` avoids a maintained linter fork and fits project-wide effect analysis,
but it does not currently share Oxlint's existing `tsgolint` process.

### TypeScript-Go has no third-party in-process server plugin surface

TypeScript-Go issue 2824 states that third-party code cannot be dynamically linked into the server process.
The intended extension boundary is the IPC API.
The repository's `_tools/customlint` directory is not a TypeScript lint extension:
`_tools/customlint/plugin.go` imports `golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis`
and registers analyzers for TypeScript-Go's own Go source.

Outcome:
the earlier hypothesis that `_tools/customlint` could host this TypeScript rule was incorrect.
An in-process Go rule needs `tsgolint`,
`ttsc`,
or a maintained TypeScript-Go-derived binary.

## Hard-gate outcomes

### Semantic compatibility

- Demand-driven incumbent:
  pass through package corpus,
  host lifecycle,
  external-consumer,
  package lint,
  and exact latency verification.
- Rust Node-API hybrid:
  pending because semantic authority remains TypeScript-Go.
- Pure Oxc Rust:
  fail.
- Native Oxlint fork:
  fail on project governance and semantic authority.
- `tsgolint` fork:
  fail on project governance,
  despite passing at the checker-access level.
- `ttsc` contributor:
  pass at the checker-access level;
  effect-rule corpus parity remains pending.

### Cold latency

- Incumbent eager implementation:
  fail at 62.9 seconds in the original incident and 49.6 seconds in the final pre-change reproduction.
- Demand-driven Oxlint JavaScript rule:
  pass at 928 milliseconds of Oxlint time and 2.11 seconds wall time with empty state.
- Existing Oxlint `tsgolint` path without the project rule:
  measured favorable evidence at 396 milliseconds,
  not proof for the added effect workload.

### Catalog removal and fail-closed behavior

Every surviving design can reject unresolved effects without a catalog.
Rust or Go does not change the information limit:
an opaque implementation receiving a caller-owned identity cannot be accepted without derived semantics,
verified isolation,
or trusted metadata.

### License and inspectability

- Oxc:
  MIT.
- TypeScript-Go:
  Apache-2.0.
- `tsgolint`:
  MIT.
- `ttsc`:
  MIT.
- NAPI-RS:
  MIT.
- Neon:
  MIT or Apache-2.0.

No inspected candidate fails the license gate.
Native artifact provenance remains pending for any adopted distribution.

### Platform support

- Node-API is available on required Node hosts.
- NAPI-RS and Neon are cross-platform frameworks,
  but a project addon still needs a verified prebuilt matrix.
- `tsgolint` publishes platform binaries through `oxlint-tsgolint`.
- `ttsc` declares Linux,
  Darwin,
  and Windows packages for x64 and arm64.

Consumer-boundary execution has not yet validated the required matrix.

## Architecture tradeoffs

### Demand-driven incumbent bridge

Pros:

- retains the current package and diagnostics surface;
- reuses the existing semantic corpus;
- avoids a native artifact owned by this package.

Cons:

- still pays synchronous TypeScript-Go RPC for semantic queries;
- JavaScript-plugin callbacks remain serialized on the main JavaScript thread;
- the current eager implementation has already failed the latency gate.

### Rust Node-API hybrid

Pros:

- can make graph,
  hashing,
  cache,
  and fixed-point work native;
- can expose one coarse synchronous call instead of many JavaScript functions;
- Node-API provides a stable Node ABI.

Cons:

- does not supply TypeScript type semantics;
- preserving TypeScript-Go facts still requires RPC or a second custom boundary;
- an asynchronous addon cannot satisfy Oxlint's synchronous rule callback;
- prebuilt release provenance and platform coverage become project responsibilities.

### Excluded `tsgolint` fork

Pros:

- runs effect logic directly beside TypeScript-Go AST and checker objects;
- shares Oxlint's existing type-aware program and command boundary;
- avoids Node-API and per-query JSON RPC;
- the rule-disabled 13-file path measured 396 milliseconds.

Cons:

- violates the no-fork and no-contribution constraint;
- TypeScript-Go shims use `go:linkname` and must track compiler versions;
- external shipped JavaScript implementation inference still needs project-owned design.

This path is excluded regardless of technical score.

### `ttsc` contributor rule

Pros:

- offers an explicit public custom-rule API over TypeScript-Go;
- supports project-scoped state and direct checker access;
- avoids maintaining a linter fork;
- source and platform packaging are inspectable.

Cons:

- runs through a separate host rather than Oxlint's existing type-aware process;
- may duplicate program setup;
- contributor binary generation and cache behavior may violate the cold target;
- current repository integration and semantic parity are unverified.

## Evaluation outcome

Demand-driven analysis through the existing Oxlint JavaScript rule is selected and implemented.
It preserved the exact linter boundary required by the user
and passed the traversal-phase semantic and latency gates exercised on Linux x64.

`ttsc` now fails the requirement that this remain an Oxlint rule.
A Rust Node-API hybrid remains technically loadable through that rule,
but no measured bottleneck remains that requires its native graph engine.
It also still lacks independent TypeScript semantic authority.

The `tsgolint` fork,
native Oxlint fork,
and upstream-contribution variants are excluded by project governance.
Pure Oxc Rust is excluded by semantic incompatibility.

## Prototype gate

The disposable implementation proved:

- the exact existing semantic corpus retains its diagnostics;
- existing package implementation inference and catalog behavior remain covered by the package corpus;
- the exact 13-file package command completes within 10 seconds with empty state;
- relevant-source and compiler-option invalidations remain within the target;
- budget exhaustion reports `analysis-incomplete` rather than passing;
- the Linux x64 built artifact passes semantic-host and external-consumer boundaries;
- no bare shutdown,
  panic,
  or process-lifecycle diagnostics reach stderr.

This phase did not remove handwritten catalogs.
It also did not rerun the final commit on macOS arm64 or Windows x64.
Those remain separate gates for the catalog-free authority and release matrix.

Final exact-command measurements at commit `656444e0a` were:

- cold empty state:
  928 milliseconds in Oxlint and 2.11 seconds wall time;
- warm unchanged state:
  918 milliseconds in Oxlint and 1.49 seconds wall time;
- changed source:
  924 milliseconds in Oxlint and 2.11 seconds wall time;
- invalidated compiler-option surface:
  922 milliseconds in Oxlint and 2.16 seconds wall time.

Every case processed 13 files with 479 rules and reported zero diagnostics.
The package build,
type lint,
unit corpus,
semantic-bridge host test,
external-consumer host test,
and 143-file package Oxlint also passed.

The implementation records callee and callback source identities in schema-3 cache entries,
binds semantic edges into invalidation closures,
and rejects missing owned sources or callable summaries.
A runtime safety ceiling reports `analysis-incomplete` rather than returning partial effects.
Explicit `ForeignBorrowed` provenance conservatively expands the complete owned graph
before declaration-wide propagation.

## Scoring and sensitivity

Only the demand-driven incumbent passed every traversal-phase hard gate.
`ttsc` fails the Oxlint-rule requirement,
and Rust Node-API remains unvalidated and unnecessary for the measured workload.
A comparative soft score cannot override those hard-gate exits.

Sensitivity remains straightforward:
if a future measured Oxlint workload fails after demand scope is minimized,
reopen the Rust hybrid only for a profiled native-computation bottleneck.
Do not reopen it for eager traversal or missing TypeScript semantics.

## Recommendation status

Retain the implemented demand-driven Oxlint JavaScript rule for the traversal and latency architecture.
It does not by itself complete the catalog-free effect-authority goal.
Do not add Rust,
Node-API,
`ttsc`,
or a custom linter distribution for the measured workload.
No path may fork or seek changes to Oxlint or `tsgolint`.
