Findings from a fresh coverage-guided plus directed-differential fuzz campaign
against `ieviev/resharp` v0.6.12 (`3d4ddde`) on ARM64 (AArch64,
 NEON SIMD).
This campaign re-tests the v0.6.12 release after the developer stated that all
bugs from the 2026-06-04 campaign (BUG-1 through BUG-27) were fixed.

## Scope and method

Three fuzz layers on ARM64,
 mirroring the 06-04 campaign's three-layer approach:

- **Pristine** (unmodified v0.6.12):
   coverage-guided `cargo-fuzz` over the
  three in-tree targets (`compile`,
   `match_invariants`,
   `diff_regex`),
   with
  AddressSanitizer.
   This exercises the NEON SIMD code paths
  (`resharp-engine/src/simd/neon.rs`) unique to ARM64.
- **Nosimd** (`has_simd() -> false`):
   same cargo-fuzz targets,
   but with the
  SIMD fast paths disabled.
   Isolates bugs that are not ARM64-SIMD-specific.
- **Suppressed fork** (re-entrancy panics demoted to `return None`):
   digs past
  BUG-1's dominant crash into the rest of the surface.

Auxiliary lanes:
 directed ARM64 correctness reproduction,
 Miri-instrumented
run on nosimd build,
 stream API test suite.

## Root-cause bug index (10 confirmed)

1. [BUG-1](bug-01-reentrant-union-panic-v0.6.12.md):
    re-entrancy guard panic
   in `attempt_rw_union_2` at `resharp-algebra/src/lib.rs:2724`.
    Compile time.
   Found by the `diff_regex` target on ARM64.
    Same site as 06-04 BUG-1.
   Developer claimed fixed;
    it was not.

2. [ARM64-BUG-1](arm64-bug-01-unicode-property-compile-blowup.md):
    Unicode
   property class compile blowup.
    `\P{L}2` takes 7.25s under ASAN on ARM64
   (162ms on x86_64).
    24 distinct timeout/slow-unit artifacts across three
   build variants.
    Root:
    `RegexBuilder::der` at `lib.rs:1379` recurses deeply
   on Unicode property class minterm enumeration.
    Same root as BUG-11/17 but
   on a class family the v0.6.12 fix did not cover.

3. [ARM64-BUG-2](arm64-bug-02-word-boundary-compile-blowup.md):
    Word boundary
   + bounded repeat compile blowup.
      `\b\w+` under flag-bundle config causes
   slow compiles.
      Likely same derivative blowup root.

4. [ARM64-BUG-3](arm64-bug-03-wb-star-compile-timeout.md):
    `\w+\b*` timeout
   on ARM64 under flag-bundle config,
    but rejected in ~1ms on x86_64.
    The
   parser's "unsupported pattern" check for `\b` inside a star does not fire
   under all `RegexOptions` configurations.

5. **ARM64-BUG-4**:
    `\B` timeout under full-unicode config.
    The nosimd
   build found `0xff5c42` (option byte 0xff,
    config index 3 = full) which
   decodes to `\B`.
    On x86_64 this compiles in ~831µs;
    on ARM64 under ASAN
   it exceeds the 10-second timeout.
    The word-boundary negation class under
   full-unicode mode has a much steeper compile cost on ARM64.

6. **ARM64-BUG-5**:
    `div>~(\p{L}iv>_*)C/div>` compile timeout.
    Found by fork
   build in default config.
    Complement `~(...)` over a Unicode property class
   with trailing literal triggers super-linear derivative.
    Same root as
   ARM64-BUG-1 but triggered via complement.

7. **ARM64-BUG-6**:
    `\p{L}\x1ehv...Hu?nter2024...` slow-unit in flag-bundle
   config.
    The Unicode property class followed by non-ASCII bytes and literal
   text causes slow compilation.
    The `ignore_whitespace` flag may alter
   tokenisation,
    allowing more of the pattern to be interpreted.

8. **ARM64-BUG-7**:
    `A-Z\p{L}5]8...` timeout in hardened config.
    Bracketed
   ASCII range followed by Unicode property class in a character class
   structure causes derivative blowup.
    Combines the bracketed-class and
   property-class cost factors.

9. **BUG-1 (suppressed)**:
    `.*(.+)*.+` still panics in debug builds.
    The
   `reentrant-assert` feature is a default feature,
    so every debug build
   will abort the host on this input.
    Release builds fall back to
   `return None`,
    which is correct but not a fix — the pattern is still
   rejected,
    not compiled.
    This is the same BUG-1 as finding 1 above but
   counted separately because the `compile` target's option-sweep triggers
   it differently (direct recursion vs `diff_regex`'s generated pattern).

10. **BUG-4 suppressed (not fixed)**:
     `~(_*$)` complement with anchors now
    rejected as "unsupported pattern" instead of leaking `usize::MAX`.
     The
    engine cannot express the pattern.
     Same for `(^|b)`,
     `\w+\b*` (x86_64
    rejects,
     ARM64 flag-bundle allows through — see ARM64-BUG-3),
    `(?<=$)` (parse error),
     `(|(?<=[a-z])b)` (rejected).
     These are not
    fixes — they are restrictions that avoid the underlying engine defects.

## Developer claim versus evidence

### Confirmed fixed on ARM64

- **BUG-3** (is_match vs find_all):
   original triggers now agree on ARM64.
- **BUG-4** (sentinel leak on `\Bb+`):
   no sentinel on ARM64.
- **BUG-7** (negated perl class nullable):
   `\D`,
   `\S`,
   `\W` on empty
  return `is_match=false` on ARM64.
- **BUG-26** (`\z\A` empty language):
   `\z\A` on empty returns
  `is_match=true, find_all=[Match{0,0}]` on ARM64.
- **BUG-27** (word boundary on empty):
   `\ba{0}\b` on empty returns
  `is_match=false` on ARM64.
- **REG-1** (duplicate zero-width spans):
   fixed by PR #14.

### Still present (not fixed)

- **BUG-1**:
   re-entrancy panic.
   Confirmed crash on ARM64 v0.6.12.
- **BUG-11/17** (bracketed perl class compile blowup):
   partially fixed
  for `[\w]` on x86_64,
   but Unicode property classes (`\p{L}`,
   `\P{L}`)
  still blow up on ARM64 (finding 2,
   ARM64-BUG-1).

### Suppressed (not fixed)

- BUG-4 complement triggers:
   rejected at parse.
- BUG-9 some triggers:
   rejected at parse.
- BUG-14:
   rejected at parse.
- BUG-16:
   parse error.
- BUG-1 (debug build):
   panics;
   release returns None.

The `match_invariants` and `diff_regex` targets were stopped early due to
throughput concerns;
 see "Throughput limitation" below.

## Throughput limitation

The `match_invariants` and `diff_regex` targets were stopped before
completing their 30-minute budget.
 The `diff_regex` target found the BUG-1
crash quickly (18k runs in ~40s) but then aborted on that crash.
The `match_invariants` target ran for ~15 minutes but spent most of its
wall-clock time stuck on timeout inputs (each consuming the full 10s
timeout).
 The root cause:
 the seed corpus for `match_invariants` was
populated from `compile` corpus entries,
 which include many Unicode
property class patterns (`\P{L}}`,
 etc.) that are compile-time blowups
(ARM64-BUG-1).
 Each such seed consumes 10+ seconds under ASAN on ARM64,
reducing effective fuzz throughput to a handful of inputs per minute.

This is a setup defect,
 not an engine defect.
 A future campaign should:

1. Filter the `match_invariants` seed corpus to exclude known-timeout
   patterns before starting the fuzz run.
2. Use a shorter per-input timeout (e.g. 2s) for `match_invariants`,
   since match-level bugs manifest quickly once the regex compiles.
3. Run `match_invariants` on the suppressed fork (which demotes BUG-1
   panics to `return None`),
    so the target does not abort on re-entrancy
   inputs.
4. Use a separate,
    minimal seed corpus for `match_invariants` containing
   only patterns that compile within 1s on ARM64,
    rather than inheriting
   the `compile` target's corpus.
