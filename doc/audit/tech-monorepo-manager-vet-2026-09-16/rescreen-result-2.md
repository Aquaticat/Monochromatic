# Rescreen chunk 2: G3 after withdrawing requirement (c)

Input: `rescreen-chunk-2.json` (10 candidates).
Screened 2026-09-16.

## Method

- Earlier evidence read first: `doc/audit/tech-monorepo-manager-vet-2026-09-16/screening-registry-chunk-3.md`, `screening-promoted-runners.md`, `discovery-expansion.md`, `rescreen-list.md`.
- Repository metadata, file trees, READMEs and repo Markdown docs were read as raw content through `gh api` (script `scratchpad/rs2/gh-fetch.ts`, `scratchpad/rs2/gh-files.ts`).
- Every page a verdict relies on was fetched exactly once with `curl --location --silent --show-error --user-agent 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:130.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/130.0' <url>` through `scratchpad/rs2/curl-page.ts`, which refuses refetches, strips `<script>`/`<style>`, measures visible text, and looks for block markers.
  Log: `scratchpad/rs2/pages/fetch-log.txt`; captures beside it.
- Every cited phrase was confirmed present in the curl capture (not only in the `gh api` Markdown).
- No GitHub fetch returned HTTP 429 in this run, so the `gh api` fallback of rule 2 was never needed.
- Release and engine metadata came from `gh api repos/<o>/<r>/releases/latest`, `https://registry.npmjs.org/<pkg>`, and `https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/<name>`.
- No candidate tool was installed or executed; no browser was used; nothing under `/var/home/user/Monochromatic` was modified.
- G1 and G2 were not re-run; the earlier evidence for each candidate matched current repository metadata (license, archived state, latest release).
- Rule 1 was applied as written: the first confusion trigger culls the candidate, so later pages were not needed for a verdict.
  Extra triggers seen while confirming the first are listed as corroboration only.

## Candidates

### cargo-flux

- URL: https://github.com/ignition-is-go/cargo-flux
- Earlier reason: G3 exit (coverage (c)): README-only docs; "Plugin Architecture" lists built-in plugins but documents no way to write, register, or load one.
- Current metadata: MIT, not archived, latest release v0.7.4 (2026-09-13); `docs/` holds only `superpowers/plans` and `superpowers/specs` design notes.
- G3 rule 2 (no-JS, bot wall): https://github.com/ignition-is-go/cargo-flux HTTP 200, 34602 visible characters, no block marker; README text present.
- G3 rule 1 (confusion): triggered, contradiction between README sections.
  - "Planning Semantics", "1. Entry points are opt-in": "Only packages that opt into a task are chosen as task entrypoints." and "Flux does not run a task on every package in the workspace."
  - "`autoapply`": "`all`: same as `inherit`, and if no package explicitly opts into the task, Flux seeds the task on every compatible package".
    The section the README calls "the most important rule set in Flux" denies the behavior that `autoapply = "all"` documents (and the "Workspace-root tasks" example uses `autoapply = "all"`).
  - Corroboration (not needed for the verdict): the "Task Definitions" reference and "Supported task variants" list omit `root_steps`, `outputs` and `when`, which appear only inside examples under "Workspace-root tasks"; the `report github-output` subcommand is absent from the "Commands" section.
- G3 rule 3 (coverage): not reached.
- Final: exit (G3 rule 1, contradiction: opt-in-only entrypoints versus `autoapply = "all"` seeding every compatible package).

### guild (guild-cli)

- URL: https://github.com/sprouted-dev/guild
- Earlier reason: G3 exit (coverage (c)): README-only docs; no extension or plugin mechanism.
- Current metadata: MIT, not archived, latest release v0.1.0 (2026-03-05); repository has no docs directory (only `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md`).
- G3 rule 2: https://github.com/sprouted-dev/guild HTTP 200, 8087 visible characters, no block marker; README text present.
- G3 rule 1: triggered, feature with no documented location.
  - "`guild.toml` Format", "Project": `tags = ["lib", "rust"]  # Optional tags for filtering`.
  - No command, flag, or section documents how to filter by tag: "CLI Commands" lists `guild`, `dev`, `build`, `test`, `lint`, `run <target> [project]`, `affected <target>`, `list`, `graph`, `cache status`, `cache clean`, `init`, with no options, and the only flags anywhere in the README are `--no-cache` and `init --yes`.
  - Corroboration: Quick Start `guild affected test  # Test only what changed since main` documents no way to choose a base other than `main`.
- G3 rule 3: not reached.
- Final: exit (G3 rule 1, tag filtering is promised but documented nowhere).

### Watchman

- URL: https://github.com/facebook/watchman (docs https://facebook.github.io/watchman/)
- Earlier reason: G3 exit (coverage (c)): sitemap has no extension or plugin page.
- Current metadata: MIT, not archived, latest release v2026.09.14.00 (2026-09-14).
- G3 rule 2: https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install HTTP 200, 7832 visible characters, no block marker; page text present.
- G3 rule 1: triggered, obsolete docs on the install page (the entry page of the "Installation" nav section).
  - "Linux binaries are compiled on a GitHub Action VM (ubuntu-20.04 at the time of this writing)".
    The current release workflow's `linux-build` job, which uploads `watchman-<release>-linux.zip`, uses `runs-on: ubuntu-24.04` (`.github/workflows/release.yml`, read with `gh api` only to confirm the staleness).
  - "macOS File Descriptor Limits": "Only applicable on macOS 10.6 and earlier".
  - "Note : Our binaries are built from the main branch only. We don't provide binaries for v4.9.0." while releases are date tags (latest v2026.09.14.00).
  - Supported-systems text still names "FreeBSD 9.1, OpenBSD 5.2" and "Windows 7 support is provided by community patches"; footer "Copyright © 2023".
- G3 rule 3: not reached.
- Final: exit (G3 rule 1, obsolete install docs: ubuntu-20.04 build host versus ubuntu-24.04 in the release workflow, macOS 10.6 guidance, v4.9.0 label).

### dev-process-manager

- URL: https://dev-process-manager.com (source https://github.com/vivid-planet/dev-process-manager)
- Earlier reason: G3 exit (coverage (c)); borderline note that the CLI-to-daemon channel is not documented as an interface.
- Current metadata: BSD-2-Clause, not archived, latest release v4.1.0 (2026-09-16); npm `dev-process-manager` 4.1.0.
- G3 rule 2: https://dev-process-manager.com/docs/getting-started HTTP 200 (redirected to `/docs/getting-started/`), 2354 visible characters, no block marker; page text present.
- G3 rule 1: triggered, version requirement disagrees with the release.
  - Getting Started, "Prerequisites": "Node.js ≥ 18".
  - Published package: `https://registry.npmjs.org/dev-process-manager/4.1.0` `engines` is `{"node":">=22"}`; the repository `package.json` says the same.
  - Corroboration (read as Markdown through `gh api`, not curl-fetched): README "Logs" documents `-n [lines]` (optional value) while `docs/docs/commands.md`, the source of https://dev-process-manager.com/docs/commands, documents `-n, --lines <number>` (required value).
- G3 rule 3: not reached.
  (Read as Markdown source before the trigger: `docs/docs/configuration.md` and `docs/docs/commands.md` do contain a field table and a command reference; watch mode is not claimed; the daemon is driven only through the documented CLI.)
- Final: exit (G3 rule 1, Getting Started "Node.js ≥ 18" versus published `engines.node` ">=22").

### baton-run (Baton)

- URL: https://kanumuri9593.github.io/Baton/ (source https://github.com/kanumuri9593/Baton)
- Earlier reason: G3 exit (coverage (c)): adapters only in `src/adapters/`; no adapter or plugin mechanism documented.
- Current metadata: MIT, not archived, latest release v0.2.6 (2026-09-09); npm `baton-run` latest 0.2.6.
- G3 rule 2:
  - https://kanumuri9593.github.io/Baton/ HTTP 200, 3785 visible characters, no block marker; shows "v0.2.6 preview".
  - https://github.com/kanumuri9593/Baton HTTP 200, 19707 visible characters, no block marker; README text present.
- G3 rule 1: triggered, version labels disagree within the README.
  - Top of README: "Baton 0.2.6 is a public developer preview."
  - "Status" section: "0.2.3 is working and tested against a large production Flutter app".
  - The latest GitHub release and npm version are 0.2.6, so the "Status" claim describes an older version with no statement about 0.2.6.
- G3 rule 3: not reached.
- Final: exit (G3 rule 1, README "0.2.6" preview versus "Status" "0.2.3 is working and tested").

### clier-ai (clier)

- URL: https://github.com/somersstack/clier
- Earlier reason: G3 exit (coverage (c)); borderline note that the Unix socket has no protocol reference.
- Current metadata: MIT, not archived, no GitHub releases or tags; npm `clier-ai` latest 1.5.0 (2026-02-19) with `engines.node` ">=20.0.0"; repository `package.json` still says version 1.0.0.
- G3 rule 2:
  - https://github.com/somersstack/clier HTTP 200, 10294 visible characters, no block marker; README text present.
  - https://github.com/somersstack/clier/blob/main/docs/configuration.md HTTP 200, 23728 visible characters, no block marker; rendered Markdown text present.
- G3 rule 1: triggered, contradictory command names for the same feature.
  - README "CLI Reference": `clier send <name> "input"   # Send stdin to a running process` (also `docs/GETTING-STARTED.md` and `docs/AGENTS.md`: `clier send <process> "data"`).
  - `docs/configuration.md` "Input Configuration": `clier input interactive-app "hello world"` and `clier input interactive-app "data" --no-newline` (also `docs/AGENTS-PIPELINE.md` and `docs/api-reference.md`: `clier input`).
  - Corroboration: README "Requirements: Node.js >= 18.0.0" versus npm 1.5.0 `engines.node` ">=20.0.0"; `docs/configuration.md` "Mixed Pipeline Example" triggers on `build-api:exit`, an event absent from its own "Built-in Events" list; `name` field "Used in: PM2 process name" and `docs/examples/README.md` "Check PM2: `pm2 list`" while the README describes its own daemon.
- G3 rule 3: not reached.
- Final: exit (G3 rule 1, `clier send` versus `clier input` for sending stdin).

### fbecart/zinoma

- URL: https://github.com/fbecart/zinoma (schema docs https://fbecart.github.io/zinoma/doc/zinoma/config/yaml/schema/struct.Project.html)
- Earlier reason: G3 exit (coverage): (a), (b), (d) present, (c) absent; borderline note that the sample output prints "Žinoma 0.19.0" while the latest release is 0.19.6.
- Current metadata: MIT, not archived, latest release 0.19.6 (2023-12-12); crates.io `max_version` 0.19.6.
- G3 rule 2:
  - https://github.com/fbecart/zinoma HTTP 200, 9301 visible characters, no block marker; README text present.
  - https://fbecart.github.io/zinoma/doc/zinoma/config/yaml/schema/struct.Project.html HTTP 200, 7440 visible characters, no block marker.
  - https://fbecart.github.io/zinoma/doc/zinoma/config/yaml/schema/enum.OutputResource.html HTTP 200, 5738 visible characters, no block marker.
- G3 rule 1: triggered, broken anchor plus version label disagreeing with releases.
  - README "Clean flag (`--clean`)" links `output.paths` to `https://fbecart.github.io/zinoma/doc/zinoma/config/yaml/schema/enum.OutputResource.html#variant.Paths.field.paths`.
    The fetched page has no `variant.Paths` anchor; its ids are `variant.Files`, `variant.Files.field.paths`, `variant.Files.field.extensions`, `variant.CmdStdout`, `variant.CmdStdout.field.cmd_stdout` (the enum variant is `Files`, not `Paths`).
  - README "Building": `./target/release/zinoma --version` prints "Žinoma 0.19.0", while the latest release and the rustdoc sidebar are 0.19.6.
- G3 rule 3: not reached.
- Final: exit (G3 rule 1, missing `#variant.Paths.field.paths` anchor; "Žinoma 0.19.0" versus release 0.19.6).

### Invincible

- URL: https://github.com/saintedlama/invincible
- Earlier reason: G3 fail, coverage (c): README-only docs, (a) and (b) present, no plugin text.
- Current metadata: MIT, not archived, latest release v1.7.0 (2026-08-15); README opens with "Proof of concept ... APIs, config format, and behaviour WILL change without notice."
- G3 rule 2: https://github.com/saintedlama/invincible HTTP 200, 16345 visible characters, no block marker; README text present.
- G3 rule 1: triggered, contradictory config file name.
  - "Configuration": "Invincible looks for `.invincible.toml` in the current directory by default."; Quick start "Edit .invincible.toml"; "Running" `--config` "(default: .invincible.toml)".
  - "CLI commands", "`invincible init`": "Create a starter `invincible.toml` in the current directory."
    The README does not say whether `init` writes a file the default lookup ignores.
- G3 rule 3: not reached.
- Final: exit (G3 rule 1, `.invincible.toml` lookup versus `init` creating `invincible.toml`).

### affected

- URL: https://github.com/Rani367/affected (docs site https://rani367.github.io/affected)
- Earlier reason: G3 fail, coverage (c); borderline note that (a) is one annotated `.affected.toml` example.
- Current metadata: MIT, not archived, latest release v1.0.0 (2026-04-02).
- G3 rule 2:
  - https://rani367.github.io/affected HTTP 200 (redirected to `/affected/`), 3595 visible characters, no block marker; its "Documentation" link goes to the GitHub README.
  - https://github.com/Rani367/affected HTTP 200, 13717 visible characters, no block marker; README text present.
- G3 rule 1: triggered, docs site examples contradict the README reference for the watch feature.
  - Docs site "Watch mode" example: `$ affected test --watch --base main`.
  - README "Usage", "`affected watch`": `affected watch test --base main` (watch is a subcommand; no `--watch` flag appears in any README usage block or in "Global Flags").
  - Corroboration: site `affected lint --output junit` versus README `--junit results.xml` and no `lint` subcommand; site and README both say "13 ecosystems" while the README feature line lists 14 names and the "Supported Ecosystems" section lists 16 rows.
- G3 rule 3: not reached; had it been, (a) would also fail, since "Configuration" is a single annotated `.affected.toml` example.
- Final: exit (G3 rule 1, `affected test --watch` on the docs site versus `affected watch test` in the README).

### devtooie

- URL: https://github.com/rhyek/devtooie
- Earlier reason: coverage (c); one HTTP 429 from GitHub after heavy request volume.
- Current metadata: MIT, not archived, latest release 0.7.1 (2026-08-17); README "Requirements": "Unix only (macOS/Linux). Windows is not supported."
- G3 rule 2:
  - https://github.com/rhyek/devtooie HTTP 200, 16448 visible characters, no block marker.
  - https://github.com/rhyek/devtooie/blob/main/docs/configuration.md HTTP 200, 16052 visible characters, no block marker.
  - https://github.com/rhyek/devtooie/blob/main/docs/package-lifecycle.md HTTP 200, 5734 visible characters, no block marker.
  - https://github.com/rhyek/devtooie/blob/main/packages/devtooie/docs/agents.md HTTP 200, 66679 visible characters, no block marker.
  - The earlier HTTP 429 (on `docs/control-api.md`) did not recur; rule 2 does not trigger.
- G3 rule 1: triggered, contradictions about controlling a running session through the control API (the (f) behavior we would consume).
  - `docs/configuration.md`, `autostart`: "Set `false` to leave it stopped; start it yourself with the `s` hotkey (or a control-API `restart`)."
  - `docs/package-lifecycle.md`, "The two manual commands": restart (`POST /command/restart`) "re-runs the dev command; available for any running package".
  - The consolidated agent guide contradicts itself on the same endpoint: `packages/devtooie/docs/agents.md` says "`POST /command/restart/<name>` starts a stopped package" in the `autostart` entry and "`POST /command/restart/<name>` works for any running package." later.
  - Corroboration: `docs/cli.md` `--rebuild` "first clears `dist/` for every build target", while the rebuild command in `docs/package-lifecycle.md` depends on `cleans: true` or `clean` + `build` scripts and is otherwise "a no-op".
- G3 rule 3: not reached.
- Final: exit (G3 rule 1, whether control-API `restart` starts a stopped package).
