# Category fit (G1) screening: general runners group

Input: `screening-runners.json`, 322 repositories.
Verdicts: 14 monorepo manager, 1 component, 307 category mismatch (20 of them marked ambiguous and quoted).
Entries keep input order, which is the discovery pass star order.

## Promoted (monorepo manager or component)

- `earthly/earthly`
  - URL: https://github.com/earthly/earthly
  - verdict: monorepo manager (borderline: per-directory Earthfiles with cross-directory target references that Earthly builds first; no workspace discovery, affected selection, or run-in-all-projects command)
  - decisive quote: "Earthly is great for both monorepos and polyrepos. You can split your build logic across multiple Earthfiles, placing some deeper inside the directory structure or even in other repositories. Referencing targets from other Earthfiles is easy regardless of where they are stored." (README.md); "references the `html` target of the directory `../html` ... Earthly executes its build for the `html` target" (examples/monorepo/README.md)
  - archived: false
- `oxequa/realize`
  - URL: https://github.com/oxequa/realize
  - verdict: component (borderline: Go-centric live-reload watcher; the HTTP interface is its web panel's websocket, which pushes project state as JSON and accepts settings JSON; no relationships between projects)
  - decisive quote: "Manage multiple projects at the same time." and "--server -> Enable the web server" (README.md); `e.GET("/ws", s.projects)` sends `json.Marshal(s.Parent)` and writes received JSON through `s.Parent.Settings.Write` (realize/server.go)
  - archived: false
- `BobBuildTool/bob`
  - URL: https://github.com/BobBuildTool/bob
  - verdict: monorepo manager (borderline: bitbake/portage-style package build orchestrator for embedded systems, where recipes define packages with dependencies; not a source-workspace task runner)
  - decisive quote: "Bob closely tracks the input of all packages. This includes all checked out sources and the dependencies to other packages. If something is changed Bob can accurately determine which packages have to be rebuilt." (doc/tutorial/fingerprints.rst)
  - archived: false
- `omio-labs/myke`
  - URL: https://github.com/omio-labs/myke
  - verdict: monorepo manager (borderline: discovers projects and runs a task across all or tagged projects; no dependency ordering between projects)
  - decisive quote: "`myke build` runs build in all projects" and "`myke <tag>/build` runs build in all projects tagged `<tag>`" (README.md)
  - archived: false
- `no0dles/hammerkit`
  - URL: https://github.com/no0dles/hammerkit
  - verdict: monorepo manager
  - decisive quote: "In a monorepo every package needs the same `install`/`build` steps, and packages depend on each other in a specific order. Hammerkit handles both with includes (reuse a task definition in each package's directory) and references (wire up cross-package order)." (docs/guides/monorepo.md)
  - archived: false
- `tuist/once`
  - URL: https://github.com/tuist/once
  - verdict: monorepo manager
  - decisive quote: "The Once graph describes the named parts of a workspace and what Once can do with them." and "Targets live in package-level `once.toml` files" (web/priv/docs/guide/graph/index.md)
  - archived: false
- `nadlejs/nadle`
  - URL: https://github.com/nadlejs/nadle
  - verdict: monorepo manager
  - decisive quote: "Monorepo-native — first-class support for multi-package workspaces" (README.md)
  - archived: false
- `kraken-build/kraken`
  - URL: https://github.com/kraken-build/kraken
  - verdict: monorepo manager (Gradle-style project and subproject tree with task addresses; its README says the OSS components are poorly documented)
  - decisive quote: under the heading "Building subprojects": "The `kraken` CLI supports running in a sub project, but requires that you point it to the root of your project using the `-p,--project-dir` option." (docs/docs/krakenw.md); the repository's own `.kraken.py` calls `project.subproject("kraken-build")`
  - archived: false
- `fbecart/zinoma`
  - URL: https://github.com/fbecart/zinoma
  - verdict: monorepo manager (borderline: named projects imported explicitly, with target dependencies across projects; no workspace discovery; watch mode has no RPC interface)
  - decisive quote: "Imported projects need to have a name defined. This name becomes a key to the `imports` object. Imported targets should be referred to with their fully qualified name: `project_name::target_name`." (CHANGELOG.md)
  - archived: false
- `metaist/ds`
  - URL: https://github.com/metaist/ds
  - verdict: monorepo manager (borderline: reads npm, uv, rye, and Cargo workspace members and runs a task in each; no dependency ordering between members)
  - decisive quote: "Workspaces are a way of managing multiple sub-projects from a top-level." (docs/workspaces.md); `ds --workspace '*' test   # special match that means "all workspaces"` (docs/workspaces.md)
  - archived: false
- `GriffinCanCode/bldr`
  - URL: https://github.com/GriffinCanCode/bldr
  - verdict: monorepo manager
  - decisive quote: "High-performance build system for polyglot monorepos." and "bldr query 'deps(//src:app)'" (README.md)
  - archived: false
- `OctaHive/octa`
  - URL: https://github.com/OctaHive/octa
  - verdict: monorepo manager
  - decisive quote: "A root Octafile can automatically discover Octafiles in monorepo projects" and "Wildcards work uniformly for both forms, such as `octa 'packages:*:build'`" (README.md)
  - archived: false
- `Jomy10/beaver`
  - URL: https://github.com/Jomy10/beaver
  - verdict: monorepo manager (borderline: C/C++-centric build system with named projects, including imported CMake, Cargo, SwiftPM, and Meson projects, and target dependencies across projects)
  - decisive quote: "Dependencies from other projects are referred to using the project:target syntax" (examples/multi-project/beaver.rb); "Beaver also integrates with other build systems so you can have dependencies that use other build systems." (README.md)
  - archived: false
- `meta-company/makex`
  - URL: https://github.com/meta-company/makex
  - verdict: monorepo manager (borderline: a Bazel-like workspace root with `//path` task references across Makex files; no per-project units)
  - decisive quote: "Workspaces define the roots or boundaries of projects or a repository. Workspaces use the special `//` prefix marker in paths to refer to Tasks consistently in a workspace" (documents/source/workspaces.md); README features list "Dependency Graphs" and "Workspaces"
  - archived: false
- `gregnazario/must`
  - URL: https://github.com/gregnazario/must
  - verdict: monorepo manager
  - decisive quote: "Demonstrates: Multi-package monorepo with cross-package dependencies, per-package workdir, and umbrella recipes." with layout `apps/api/Mustfile.toml`, `apps/web/Mustfile.toml`, `libs/core/Mustfile.toml` (examples/monorepo-workspace/Mustfile.toml)
  - archived: false

## Method notes

- Metadata:
  `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>` for all 322 repositories, 6 concurrent requests, via `runners-g1/fetch-meta.ts`.
  Every call succeeded: no 404s, no errors, no renamed `full_name`.
  31 of the 322 are archived.
  `jjangga0214/haetae` resolves, but its README is only a pointer to `haetae-org/haetae`, which was read instead.
- Decision basis:
  the description and topics decided the clear cases.
  The discovery notes in `discovery-github.md` were used only as hints.
- READMEs:
  51 fetched with `gh api repos/<o>/<r>/readme`, all without errors.
  42 were read in full or through their relevant head.
  9 long ones (`earthly/earthly`, `state-alchemists/zrb`, `iPeluwa/rush`, `OctaHive/octa`, `neural-chilli/fkn`, `NWelde/better-ci`, `gregnazario/must`, `mikeleppane/uvtx`, `dreadl0ck/zeus`) were searched for workspace, project, watch, daemon, server, RPC, and MCP terms, and the matching sections were read.
- Beyond READMEs:
  some READMEs did not settle the question, so the following repository files were read through `gh api`:
  `go-task/task` `website/src/latest/docs/guide.md` (search only),
  `earthly/earthly` `examples/monorepo/README.md`,
  `no0dles/hammerkit` `docs/guides/monorepo.md`,
  `metaist/ds` `docs/workspaces.md`,
  `meta-company/makex` `documents/source/workspaces.md`,
  `Jomy10/beaver` `examples/multi-project/beaver.rb`,
  `gregnazario/must` `examples/monorepo-workspace/Mustfile.toml`,
  `tuist/once` `web/priv/docs/guide/graph/index.md`,
  `kraken-build/kraken` `docs/docs/index.md` and `docs/docs/concepts/tasks.md`,
  `haetae-org/haetae` `packages/docs/pages/index.mdx`,
  and `oxequa/realize` `realize/server.go`, to check what its HTTP interface does.
- Code search:
  20 `search/code` queries through `runners-g1/code-search.ts`, with a 7-second gap between queries.
  3 queries returned 0 even though the repository contains the term:
  `gregnazario/must` for `monorepo` (the example `Mustfile.toml` says "monorepo") and for `workspace`, and `haetae-org/haetae` for `monorepo` (its docs index says "monorepo").
  GitHub's code search index is therefore incomplete for some repositories, so a 0 result was never used as evidence of absence.
  Related files were read directly instead.
- Borderline rule, applied the same way to every repository:
  - promote when the tool's own docs describe multiple projects, packages, or directory units as a supported layout,
    and the tool can run work across those units (dependencies between units' tasks, running a task in every member, affected selection, or a graph);
  - a generic include or import feature without that multi-project framing counts as a mismatch (`go-task/task`, `bab-sh/bab`);
  - `nat-n/poethepoet` is the closest mismatch and the call the rule separates least cleanly.
    Its docs do mention monorepos, but the documented mechanism copies another file's task definitions into one project's task list,
    optionally with a separate `cwd`.
    It documents no project units, no fan-out across members, and no dependencies between projects.
    Revisit it if include-based composition should count;
    `go-task/task` and `bab-sh/bab` would then need the same review;
  - "borderline" in a verdict names the missing piece:
    `metaist/ds` and `omio-labs/myke` run tasks across projects but have no dependency order between projects,
    and `earthly/earthly` and `meta-company/makex` link targets by path rather than modeling projects.
  - The component category was applied only to a persistent watch process that has an RPC, IPC, or HTTP interface.
    Watch modes without such an interface (`fbecart/zinoma`, `go-godo/godo`, `taskctl/taskctl`, `mikeleppane/uvtx`, and others) did not qualify.
    Servers that are not watch processes (`state-alchemists/zrb`, `kinematic-ci/machinery`, `Jakkoble/HexaTask`) did not qualify.
    A dormant MCP server (`neural-chilli/qp`) did not qualify.
- Nothing was installed or run.
  Nothing under the Monochromatic worktree was modified;
  the scratch scripts and intermediate files are in `scratchpad/runners-g1/`.
