# Category fit screening: registry runners group

Input: `screening-registry-runners.json`, 102 npm and crates.io entries.
Verdicts: 0 monorepo manager, 2 component (both borderline), 100 category mismatch (24 of them marked ambiguous and quoted).
Entries keep input order.

## Promoted (monorepo manager or component)

- `@sohaha/zzz`
  - URL: https://github.com/sohaha/zzz
  - verdict: component (borderline: Go "daily development aids" toolbox whose `zzz watch` subcommand is a persistent file watcher that reruns commands; its HTTP side is an optional live-reload static server, off by default (`type: none`), and the websocket only broadcasts changed-file JSON; no command or control API and no project model)
  - decisive quote: `Short: "文件变更监控"` ("file change monitoring") (`cmd/watch.go`); default watch config `# 本地静态服务器` ("local static server") with `http:` / `type: none` / `port: 0` (`app/root/config.go`); `service.GET("/", ...)` hands websocket requests to `ws.HandleRequest`, and `sendChang` sends `json.Marshal(data)` for each changed file through `ws.Broadcast` (`app/watch/http.go`)
  - evidence source: npm README says only "日常开发辅助工具" (daily development aids), so the verdict rests on GitHub source read through `gh api`
- `rnme` (runme.rs)
  - URL: https://github.com/dgrijalva/runme
  - verdict: component (borderline: agent-facing task runtime; `rnme --mcp` is a long-lived MCP supervisor on stdio that watches `RUNME.rs` files and rebuilds, and it drives `rnme --engine` children over a loopback TCP JSONL RPC; tasks can hold file watches; the README says it has no dependency graph and discovers `RUNME.rs` files by directory, with no relationships between projects)
  - decisive quote: "Can also be used as an MCP for direct agent access via runme --mcp." and "There's currently no in-built dependency graph." and "`ctx.watch()` returns a debounced stream of changed paths." (crates.io README); "Give an agent a stable interface for driving rnme over the lifetime of a session: list tasks, run them (foreground or backgrounded), monitor their state, query their output." and "`--engine` — engine + TCP JSONL server bound to `127.0.0.1:0`" and "`--mcp` — MCP server on stdio ... Watches RUNME.rs files; on change, spawns a new engine and routes new top-level spawns there." (`docs/mcp_design.md`)

## Category mismatch

- `just`: justfile command runner ("🤖 Just a command runner"), no workspace model; `@indiekitai/just` TS port only adds an MCP recipe server with no watching (ambiguous: "MCP Server — expose justfile recipes to AI agents").

- `mxflow`: YAML workflow runner, no project model.
- `task-pipeliner`: YAML/JSON pipeline runner; its daemon is a cron scheduler, not a watcher with an API (ambiguous: "tp schedule start -d  # Start scheduler daemon in background").
- `@madinco/smith`: Artisan-style command runner ("Artisan-style command runner for Node projects and personal workflows"); npm README empty.
- `zet-x`: per-project command registry found by walking up to `x.config.mjs` ("A project-level task runner for teams. Define dev commands in a config file, run them with `x <command>`.").

- `metcalf`: runs tasks over parameter sets from JSON.
- `shellforge`: personal terminal workflow scripts.
- Ease task manager (via `ease-task-sass`): the package is a SASS plugin (add-on) for Ease, itself a scheduled job runner (ambiguous: "This is a plugin for the Ease task runner"; Ease: "A minimal task runner with scheduling capabilities").
- `npm-tasks`: npm-scripts enhancer.
- `run-project-commands`: "RPC" is the command name, not an RPC interface; shows package info for one project (ambiguous: "When you run `rpc` in a project directory, it will display the package name and version from the package.json file.").
- Flow (`@nikivdev/flow`): per-project `flow.toml` task picker; long-running watchers belong to a separate private `lin` hub (ambiguous: "Flow itself no longer tries to manage servers, watchers, or tracing—that all belongs to `lin`.").

- `cargo-auto` (with `cargo-rssc`): tasks written as a Rust helper sub-project; the "sub-project" is the task code, not a workspace model (ambiguous: "will create a new Rust sub-project `automation_tasks_rs` inside your Rust project").

- `cargo-task`: tasks as Rust crates; the Cargo workspace only builds the task crates (ambiguous: "you want to keep the task crates in a separate workspace").

## Method notes

- Registry names: 69 entries came with GitHub, GitLab, Codeberg, Gitee, Bitbucket or other non-registry URLs; each was matched to its npm or crates.io name by repository URL against the discovery pass's saved search pages (`data/npm-*.json`, `data/crates-*.json`). `@indiekitai/just`, `pub-just`, `cargo-rssc`, `jido-kit`, `machfile-cli`, `mdtask-core`, `party-run` and the hulk family members were fetched alongside their main entries.
- npm: `https://registry.npmjs.org/<pkg>` full documents (description, keywords, repository, latest version date, top-level or latest-version README).
- crates.io: `https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/<name>` plus `/api/v1/crates/<name>/<version>/readme`, with `--user-agent 'monochromatic-vet-discovery'` and a 1.1 s delay between requests. `cb2`, `cmd-runner` and `runtask` returned 403 for the README (no README uploaded); npm READMEs were empty for `@madinco/smith`, `zet-x` and `violet.ts`.
- Every README was scanned for workspace, monorepo, subproject, filter, graph, watch, daemon, server, RPC, IPC, socket and MCP terms, and flagged ones were read in context. Descriptions alone decided the rest.
- READMEs outside the registry, read only where registry text could not decide: GitHub READMEs for `zet-x` and `i-do`, the `yampp` repository root README, npm `@chisel/ease` (the tool behind `ease-task-sass`), and, through `gh api`, the source of `sohaha/zzz` (`cmd/watch.go`, `app/watch/http.go`, `app/root/config.go`) and `dgrijalva/runme` `docs/mcp_design.md`.
- Component bar used: a long-running process that watches files and also exposes a network, stdio RPC or IPC surface. Tools with a server or MCP but no watching (`meriadoc`, `mdtask`, `@indiekitai/just`, `yarli`, `vibe-queue`, `task-pipeliner`, `emergent-engine`) and tools with watch mode but no interface (`mk`, `tazk`, `flux-core`, `phenotype-forge`, `rsbuild`, `@yampp/yampp`) were counted as mismatches.
- Words that looked like signals but weren't: "workspace" in `helm-ctrl` (editor), `oxdock` (temp dir), `yarli` (git worktrees) and `cargo-task` (task crates); "RPC" in `run-project-commands` (binary name); "graph" in `faster-build`, `tazk`, `only`, `forger-runner`, `drevo-patmat` and `flux-core` (task graphs, not project graphs).
- No candidate was installed or run, and no browser was used.
- Scratch scripts and raw fetches: `registry-runners/` (`resolve.ts`, `fetch.ts`, `print.ts`, `show.ts`, `raw/`).
