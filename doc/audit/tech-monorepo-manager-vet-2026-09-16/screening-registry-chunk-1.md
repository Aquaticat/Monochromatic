# Monorepo manager screening, registry chunk 1

Input: `screening-registry-chunk-1.json` (68 candidates).
Screened 2026-09-16.
Nothing was installed or executed.
Evidence came from `gh api` (repository metadata, READMEs, docs trees), `https://registry.npmjs.org/<pkg>` (metadata and tarball file lists, extracted without running), PyPI JSON, and docs pages.

Rules applied, including the two user rule changes received mid-task:

- Gates stop at the first failure.
- G3 confusion rule: any confusion reading official docs (broken or 404 links, truncated or contradictory summaries, needing source or outside material to understand documented behavior, pages that do not load) is an immediate G3 exit, applied retroactively to recorded structure signals.
- G3 no-JavaScript rule: each docs page relied on was fetched with plain `curl --location --silent --show-error --user-agent 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:130.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/130.0'`; a block page, empty JS shell, or missing docs text is an exit.
  Some early pnpm, Yarn, and Vite+ reads used WebFetch; every page cited for those candidates was re-fetched with that curl command and the cited text was found in the returned HTML.
- "Latest release" is the newest registry publish (npm unless stated), with GitHub release or tag dates where they differ.
- "License declared in package.json only" means the repository root has no LICENSE file and GitHub detects no license, but the published manifest names one.

### Bolt

- URL: https://github.com/boltpkg/bolt
- License: MIT
- Latest release: npm `bolt` 0.24.10, 2021-09-28 (no GitHub releases; last push 2024-06-01)
- Archived: no; npm deprecated flag not set
- G1: pass.
  README (https://github.com/boltpkg/bolt#readme) models a project of workspaces and runs `bolt ws run [script]` "in every package".
- G2: pass, MIT.
- G3: exit (coverage).
  The README is the only doc.
  It has no extension or plugin documentation (c), and the configuration section documents only `bolt.workspaces`.
  The command table marks several commands as not yet implemented.
- G4: no watch, inspection, or control features documented.
- Final: exit at G3 (no extension mechanism documentation; README-only docs).

### drkns

- URL: https://github.com/frantzmiccoli/drkns
- License: MIT (`LICENSE.md`; GitHub API reports NOASSERTION)
- Latest release: PyPI `drkns` 4.0.0, 2026-08-25 (npm 404; tag 4.0.0)
- Archived: no
- G1: pass.
  README: each `drkns.yml` "unit" declares `dependencies`, and `drkns run` runs steps with dependency-aware caching across units.
- G2: pass, MIT.
- G3: exit (coverage).
  README (https://github.com/frantzmiccoli/drkns#readme) has `drkns.yml` fields (a) and a CLI command list (b), but no extension or plugin mechanism (c).
- G4: (g) `drkns generate` renders a CI config from a `.drknsgeneration/*.template.*` file (README "Parallel CI generation").
  No watch or daemon.
- Final: exit at G3 (no extension mechanism documentation).

### Nix

- URL: https://github.com/NixOS/nix
- License: LGPL-2.1
- Latest release: tag 2.35.2, 2026-08-12
- Archived: no
- G1: exit (category mismatch).
  https://nix.dev/manual/nix/latest/introduction: "Nix is a purely functional package manager."
  The manual introduction describes no workspace or project model and no running of tasks across repository projects; builds are derivations.
- G2, G3: not evaluated.
- Final: exit at G1 (package manager and build tool, no workspace task model).

### pnpm

- URL: https://pnpm.io
- License: MIT
- Latest release: v12.4.2, 2026-09-15
- Archived: no
- G1: pass.
  https://pnpm.io/cli/recursive: with `--sort` (default) "commands follow the workspace dependency graph. Recursive `run` also applies relationships from the `tasks` setting."
- G2: pass, MIT.
- G3: exit (confusion and structure, per the retroactive rule).
  Coverage exists: settings reference https://pnpm.io/settings, CLI https://pnpm.io/cli/run and https://pnpm.io/cli/recursive, hooks https://pnpm.io/pnpmfile.
  Triggers:
  - Task running is split across unrelated nav sections with no linking page: the `tasks` graph is under Features (https://pnpm.io/workspace-task-orchestration), `pnpm pipeline` is under CLI commands > Run scripts (https://pnpm.io/cli/pipeline), and `pnpm -r` is under CLI commands > Misc. (next to `self-update`, `store`, `doctor`).
  - https://pnpm.io/workspace-task-orchestration "Caching a task" says the `outputs`, `inputs`, `env`, `cache`, and `cargoTargetDir` keys "are read by pnpm pipeline only", but the article body contains no links, so a reader cannot reach the pipeline page from there.
  - The settings reference defers `tasks`, `pipelines`, and `pipelineBase` to a "Settings documented elsewhere" list rather than documenting them.
- G4: (d) `pnpm pipeline --repo <url> --watch` polls a git repository for new revisions; the docs call it "a proof of concept, not a hosted CI service" (https://pnpm.io/cli/pipeline).
  It is not file-change watching.
  (e) No inspection of a running process; pnpr stores reports of settled runs over HTTP (https://pnpm.io/pnpr/pipeline-runs).
  (f) None.
- Final: exit at G3 (task-running docs scattered across Features, Run scripts, and Misc. with no links between them).

### Yarn

- URL: https://yarnpkg.com
- License: BSD-2-Clause
- Latest release: `@yarnpkg/cli` 4.18.0, 2026-07-29
- Archived: no
- G1: pass.
  https://yarnpkg.com/cli/workspaces/foreach: "If `-t,--topological` is set, Yarn will only run the command after all workspaces that it depends on through the `dependencies` field have successfully finished executing."
- G2: pass, BSD-2-Clause.
- G3: exit (confusion).
  https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/plugin-tutorial, section "Official hooks": "Our new website doesn't support generating the hook list yet; sorry :("
  The plugin hook reference is missing from the plugin guide, and the page links nowhere else for it.
  Config reference https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc and CLI reference exist.
- G4: (g) constraints enforce and fix manifest rules (https://yarnpkg.com/features/constraints).
  No watch, daemon, or remote control claimed.
- Final: exit at G3 (plugin hook list missing from official docs).

### Builder (FormidableLabs)

- URL: https://github.com/FormidableLabs/builder
- License: MIT
- Latest release: npm `builder` 5.0.0, 2019-11-07
- Archived: yes (GitHub archived)
- G1: exit (category mismatch).
  README: "Builder takes your `npm` tasks and makes them composable", using "archetypes" to share `package.json` scripts across many similar repositories.
  It runs tasks within one project and has no workspace or relationship model.
- Final: exit at G1 (shared npm-script runner).

### Lank

- URL: https://github.com/FormidableLabs/lank
- License: MIT
- Latest release: npm `lank` 0.2.1, 2018-08-21
- Archived: yes
- G1: exit (category mismatch).
  README: relationships are used only by `lank link` (to delete cross-project `node_modules` copies).
  `lank exec` "runs the same command in all linked projects", filtered by tags or module names, with no dependency ordering.
- Final: exit at G1 (multi-repo linker plus flat exec).

### wsrun

- URL: https://github.com/hfour/wsrun
- License: MIT
- Latest release: npm 5.2.4, 2020-10-08 (last push 2024-05-04)
- Archived: no
- G1: pass.
  README: `--stages` runs "starting from those that don't depend on other packages"; `-r` includes dependencies.
- G2: pass, MIT.
- G3: exit (coverage).
  The README (https://github.com/hfour/wsrun#readme) is the only doc: it has CLI flags (b) but no configuration file reference (a) and no extension mechanism (c).
- G4: no native watch; runs package `watch` scripts with `--done-criteria`.
- Final: exit at G3 (no config or extension documentation).

### Vite+ task runner (vp run)

- URL: https://github.com/voidzero-dev/vite-task
- License: MIT (vite-task and vite-plus repositories)
- Latest release: `vite-plus` 0.3.2, 2026-09-14; `@voidzero-dev/vite-task-client` 0.2.0, 2026-06-18; vite-task repository has no releases or tags
- Archived: no
- G1: pass.
  https://viteplus.dev/guide/run documents `vp run -r` in dependency order and `-t` transitive runs; the tasks config reference is https://viteplus.dev/config/run.
- G2: pass, MIT.
- G3: exit (coverage and confusion).
  The official docs have no extension or plugin mechanism for the task runner (c).
  The only integration point, `@voidzero-dev/vite-task-client`, gets one sentence on https://viteplus.dev/guide/automatic-data-tracking ("Third-party tools can report cache metadata with @voidzero-dev/vite-task-client"), which links to an npmx.dev package page instead of an API reference.
- G4: no watch mode or remote control on the run guide.
- Final: exit at G3 (task-runner extension point documented only by an off-site package link).

### @visulima/vis

- URL: https://visulima.com/packages/vis
- License: MIT
- Latest release: `@visulima/vis` 4.0.2, 2026-09-07 (`@visulima/task-runner` 1.0.6, 2026-09-03)
- Archived: no
- G1: pass.
  https://visulima.com/docs/packages/vis: "A CLI task runner for monorepo workspaces with task caching, dependency-aware scheduling".
- G2: pass, MIT.
- G3: exit (confusion: truncated and contradictory summary).
  https://visulima.com/docs/packages/vis/configuration, "Plugins", presents "Available hooks" as a table of 7 hooks with no link to a complete list.
  https://visulima.com/docs/packages/vis/guides/plugins documents 13, adding `task:stdout`, `task:stderr`, `task:retry`, `task:fingerprint`, `service:start`, `service:stop`, and `service:attach`.
  The two pages also name the `task:cacheMiss` argument differently (`reasons` versus `reason`).
  Also seen: `packages/tooling/vis/docs/guides/caching.mdx` exists in the repository, but https://visulima.com/docs/packages/vis/guides/caching returns HTTP 404 "Page not found", and without JavaScript the sidebar exists only as hydration data (8 anchor links in the served HTML).
- G4: (d) `vis run --watch` reruns on file change and documents its watch scope and backends (https://visulima.com/docs/packages/vis/commands/run, "Watch Mode").
  (e) `vis-mcp` "speaks JSON-RPC over stdio" with read-only workspace and run-log tools (https://visulima.com/docs/packages/vis/guides/ai-integration), but it is not attached to a running watch process.
  (f) The MCP server "ships no side-effecting tools"; `vis service` manages long-lived services.
  (g) The configuration page has Constraints and CODEOWNERS sections.
- Final: exit at G3 (hook reference summary contradicts the plugin guide).

### bun-workspaces

- URL: https://bunworkspaces.com
- License: MIT
- Latest release: npm `bun-workspaces` 1.12.0, 2026-06-14; its successor `pacwich` v0.7.2, 2026-09-01 (GitHub release, repository `smorsic/pacwich`)
- Archived: no; https://bunworkspaces.com shows a banner saying bun-workspaces "has been deprecated and is now developed as pacwich" (npm deprecated field not set)
- G1: pass (evaluated on the pacwich continuation).
  https://pacwich.dev/concepts/affected runs scripts on affected workspaces, where "if a workspace dependency is affected for any reason, its dependents are also considered affected".
  Script order itself is alphanumeric or manual `order` values (https://pacwich.dev/concepts/script-execution-order/).
- G2: pass, MIT.
- G3: exit (confusion).
  - https://pacwich.dev/config/env-vars/ is labeled "Environment Variables" in the sidebar, but its `<title>` is "Workspace Configuration | pacwich Documentation", the same title as the real workspace configuration page.
    https://pacwich.dev/llms.txt lists it the same way.
  - https://pacwich.dev/concepts/workspace-dependencies/ shows leftover authoring text in the published page: "Alt workspace dependency examples for .md page in place of <WorkspaceDependencyExample /> above:".
  - No plugin or extension mechanism is documented; the docs index has only a CLI, a TypeScript API, and config.
- G4: not assessed beyond the above; an MCP page exists at https://pacwich.dev/ai/mcp/.
- Final: exit at G3 (mislabeled page title and leaked placeholder text; no extension mechanism).

- Archived: no
- G1: exit (category mismatch: library that wraps other runners).
  `packages/astromech/README.md` calls it "A plain library" that `@theholocron/cli` instantiates.
  `holocron run <task>` resolution: "turbo.json defines the task → turbo run <task>", else "<detected pm> run <task>".
  It generates workflows and scripts; it does not model projects or relationships itself.

### vx (@vzn/vx, with @vzn/vx-cloud)

- URL: https://github.com/vznjs/vx
- License: MIT
- Latest release: `@vzn/vx` 0.0.21, 2026-09-13; `@vzn/vx-cloud` 0.0.16, 2026-07-12
- Archived: no
- G1: pass.
  README: task graph with `dependsOn: ['^build']`, `vx run build` covers the "cwd project + its workspace deps".
- G2: pass, MIT.
- G3: exit (confusion: broken link on the docs home).
  The first docs page, https://vznjs.github.io/vx/ (HTTP 200 via curl), has a "Benchmarks: tables, methodology, reproduce it →" link whose served `href` is the unrendered template string `{href('benchmarks/')}`.
  It resolves to https://vznjs.github.io/vx/%7Bhref('benchmarks/')%7D, which returns HTTP 404 "Page not found".
  Reading stopped there, per the rule.
- G4: per the README only: (d) `vx watch lint` "re-run on file changes".

  README: "Lattice runs the tasks in your repo in dependency order and in parallel."
- G2: pass, ISC.
- G3: exit (coverage).
  CLI (https://latticeandcompany.github.io/lattice/docs/cli) and configuration (https://latticeandcompany.github.io/lattice/docs/configuration) references exist.
  There is no plugin or extension mechanism: the only "Extension seams" (https://latticeandcompany.github.io/lattice/docs/architecture) are contributor instructions to edit source, for example "Add a DriverSpec to the DRIVERS array in lattice-workspace" (c).
- G4: (e)(f) the desktop app links the engine in-process ("The engine is linked into the app"; https://latticeandcompany.github.io/lattice/docs/desktop-app), so there is no IPC.
  (d) Persistent tasks are supported, but no watch mode is documented.
- Final: exit at G3 (extension only by modifying source).

### monopkg

- G1: pass.
  Repository `docs/guides/run.md`: `--strict` "Wait for the dependencies to be resolved before running the scripts."
- G2: pass.
- G3: exit (confusion: official docs site unreachable).
  The README links "Documentation" to https://monopkg.beerush.io, which is also the repository homepage; curl returned "Could not resolve host: monopkg.beerush.io".

- G1: pass.
  README: "every build step lands in one dependency graph, cached by its inputs"; targets declare dependencies, with plugin rules (`plugin @fabr-build/js`).
- G2: pass, GPL-3.0-or-later.
- G3: exit (no-JavaScript and curl rule: docs not retrievable).
  The first curl request to https://fabr.build/ failed with "Connection timed out after 40000 milliseconds" (HTTP status 000; resolves to 67.205.27.5; an IPv4 retry also timed out).
  WebFetch from another network did load the page, so this looks like network-level blocking of this client or a routing problem, not an outage.
  This exit is weaker than the others; see the report notes.
- Final: exit at G3.

- URL: https://github.com/HamzaKV/monorun
- License: MIT
- Latest release: npm 0.1.5, 2025-05-17 (repository pushed 2026-08-13)
- Archived: no
- G1: pass.
  README: "Tasks run in topological order based on workspace relationships."
- G2: pass, MIT.
- G3: exit (confusion).
  README "Configuration" gives only an example: the `hooks.cache.read` comment says "return a CacheRow", and `write(hash, ctx)` takes a `ctx`, but neither `CacheRow` nor `ctx` is documented, so their shape must be read from source.
  There is no complete configuration field reference.
- G4: README "Future Plans: Support for watch mode", so no watch today.

### @shazhou/proman (with proman-core)

- License: MIT
- Latest release: 0.2.0, 2025-10-16
- Archived: no (repository description "[WIP]")
- G1: exit (category mismatch).
  The README documents no commands.
  The docs site overview (https://oss.zero-one-group.com/monorepo/overview/) describes a monorepo template whose task running is moon ("moon :test Run tests in all projects"), so moci is scaffolding and migration tooling.

  README: `--all` "will run the script on all packages but still respect the dependency order."

- G3: exit (confusion).
  README "run a script": "Mono also provides the ```--no-wait``` flag to run scripts ." (the sentence stops without saying what the flag does).
  The "exit code" and "package managers" sections repeat an unrelated `mono <package> <script> -- <args>` example.
  A resolver extension (`mono.config.js`) is documented.
- Final: exit at G3.

### pmnps (with @pmnps/* plugins)

## Survivors

None.
All 68 candidates in this chunk exit:

- G1 (category): 29 exits: Nix, Builder, Lank, Holocron astromech, nmr, npm-recursive-runner, packer-commander, run-shared-scripts, northbrook, scriptio, bru, @layermix/cli, @tinyaxis/toolkit, @halecraft/verify, greenly, @multiterm/rune, qiao-project, laufen, mondorepo, buildverse, fiducial, @gio-labs/rune, unorepo, roc-plugin-repo, @shazhou/proman, moci, lerna-run, monilla, yamat.
- G2 (license or source): 3 exits: changeset-releaser (no license), dragon (empty repository), @zssz-soft/zs (repository 404).
- G3 (documentation, including the confusion and no-JavaScript rules): 36 exits: Bolt, drkns, pnpm, Yarn, wsrun, Vite+ task runner, @visulima/vis, bun-workspaces/pacwich, mono-vir, yakumo, bun-spaces, @forklaunch/bunrun, @aklinker1/buildc, @enspirit/emb, workspace-utils, rman, @nu-art/build-and-install, neex, calviche, laoban, crowd, mrpm, @jakehamilton/titan, vx, lattice, monopkg, Fabr, monox, @varlabs/monorun, bun-manage-workspace, just-build-tools, mono-runner, pmnps, @webeferen/buildable, monist, mrdr.

Exit to re-check first: Fabr.
Its G3 exit rests on a curl connection timeout from this host (HTTP 000), while another fetcher loaded https://fabr.build/.
The user rules name bot challenges, block pages, and JavaScript shells, not TCP timeouts, so this exit is less certain than the rest.
