# Registry screening, chunk 3

Input: `screening-registry-chunk-3.json` (68 candidates: 35 monorepo, 33 component).
Screened 2026-09-16.

## Method and caveats

- Repository metadata (license, archived, releases, root listing, README) came from `gh api`.
  Crate metadata came from `https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/<name>` with the `monochromatic-vet-discovery` user agent.
  Package metadata came from `https://registry.npmjs.org/<pkg>`.
- Docs sites were fetched once each with `curl --location --silent --show-error --user-agent 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:130.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/130.0'`.
- Repo-hosted Markdown docs were read as raw content through `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/contents/<path>`.
  A single probe of a rendered GitHub blob page with the required curl command
  (`https://github.com/rhyek/devtooie/blob/main/docs/control-api.md`) returned `HTTP 429` with the page "Whoa there! You have triggered an abuse detection mechanism."
  A later probe of a repository root page (`https://github.com/Natoandro/park`) returned `200`.
  Under G3 rule 2 this block would exit any candidate whose only docs are rendered GitHub blob pages; no candidate in this chunk reached that point without an earlier exit, so it changes no verdict here.
- No candidate tool was installed or executed. One published crate tarball (`haz-cli-0.2.0.crate`) was listed with `tar --list` to confirm a license file.

  - https://cuenv.dev/tutorials/monorepo/ (HTTP 200) only runs `cuenv task dev -p services/api` and `cuenv task dev -p services/web` separately; https://cuenv.dev/how-to/run-tasks/ (HTTP 200) has no cross-project section.
    The only description of cross-project dependencies (`externalInputs`) found is ADR-0007, which also says "Generated JSON schema has been regenerated from Rust types; future iteration will align serde renames."
  - https://cuenv.dev/explanation/cuenv-workspaces/ (HTTP 200) mixes test-implementation notes into user docs, for example "Cargo lockfile parser integration tests return Result and use named entry lookup/error helpers so parser assertions stay explicit without file-level unwrap_used or expect_used allowances."
    The "Explanation" navigation mixes crate internals (`cuenv-codeowners`, `cuenv-events`), "Cuetty gap analysis", and "Roadmap".
