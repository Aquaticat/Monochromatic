# Monorepo manager screening, chunk 2

Screened 2026-09-16.
Input: `screening-chunk-2.json` (29 candidates).
Rules applied: G1 category fit, G2 inspectable open source, G3 documentation gate, G4 capability notes.
Mid-task rule changes applied to every candidate, including retroactively:

- G3 confusion rule: any confusion or frustration while reading official docs (broken links, contradictory text, features only explained by source or fixtures, pages that do not load) is an immediate G3 exit, and a recorded structure signal counts as an exit.
- G3 no-JS rule: every docs page relied on was fetched with `curl --location --silent --show-error --user-agent 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:130.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/130.0'`, checking HTTP status, bot-challenge markers, and whether the doc text is present outside `<script>` tags.
  All pages checked returned 200 with doc text present in server-rendered HTML, except `https://docs.warp.build/` (DNS failure).
  On GitHub pages the literal `captcha` appears only inside feature-flag names (`octocaptcha_origin_optimization`), not a challenge.
  No candidate survived because a browser rendered its docs.

Evidence method: `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>`, releases and tags (newest tag date = tagged commit date), shallow clones of each repo for docs sources, and fetches of live docs pages.
No candidate tool was installed or executed.

- Latest release: no GitHub releases; newest tag `0.21.2` (tagged commit 2026-09-11)
- Archived: false
- G1 pass (monorepo manager).
  README: "a command line tool to improve the workflow of building, testing and using multiple software packages. It automates the process, handles the ordering".
  Workspace concept and dependency-aware selection (`--packages-up-to`, `--packages-above`) at https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/user/how-to.html
- G2 pass: Apache-2.0 license file covers the tool; no hosted-only parts.
- G3 exit (coverage (c)).
  - (a) Configuration reference present: https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/user/configuration.html (`colcon.pkg`, `.meta`, `defaults.yaml`, `COLCON_HOME`).
  - (b) CLI reference present: https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/reference/verb/build.html and sibling verb pages, plus global/executor/selection argument pages.
  - (c) Missing how third parties add behavior. https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/developer/extension-point.html only names extension points and when they run ("The following describes some of the extension points and how they are used"); it never says how an extension is registered, discovered, or what interface it implements.
    The design page (https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/developer/design.html) states extensibility as a goal only.
    Writing an extension requires reading source, which counts as undocumented.
  - (d) to (f) not claimed natively.
  - No-JS check: extension-point and configuration pages 200, text present.
- G4
  - (d) watch mode: none documented natively.
  - (e) inspect running process: none.
  - (f) control running process: none.
  - (g) generate/enforce files: none documented.
- Final: exit at G3 (coverage (c): extension registration undocumented).

- Latest release: no GitHub releases (single tag `v0`, 2024-01-05); npm `onerepo` latest `2.0.0` published 2025-06-28
- Archived: false
- G1 pass (monorepo manager).
  `one tasks` "Run tasks against repo-defined lifecycles. This command will limit the tasks across the affected Workspace set based on the current state of the repository." (https://onerepo.tools/core/tasks/)
- G2 pass: MIT license file.
- G3 exit (confusion).
  - Coverage was otherwise met: config reference https://onerepo.tools/docs/config/, tasks CLI reference https://onerepo.tools/core/tasks/, plugin mechanism https://onerepo.tools/plugins/#writing-plugins plus https://onerepo.tools/api/.
  - Confusion trigger (contradictory text): on https://onerepo.tools/docs/config/ the `taskConfig?` section documents `lifecycles?` and `stashUnstaged?` as keys under `taskConfig`, but both examples set them under `tasks` (`tasks: { lifecycles: ['deploy-staging'] }` and `tasks: { stashUnstaged: [...] }`).
    https://onerepo.tools/core/tasks/#adding-more-lifecycles uses `taskConfig: { lifecycles: [...] }`.
    A reader cannot tell which key path is correct without reading source.
    Confirmed in served HTML by plain curl (200; excerpt: "tasks: { lifecycles: [ 'deploy-staging' ], }, }; stashUnstaged?").
  - Further signal: the "API Reference" nav group lists only `builders`, `file`, `git` namespaces while most API (plugins, graph, config types) lives on the single `/api/` page.
- G4
  - (d) no native task watch mode; the Jest and Vitest plugins pass `--watch` to those tools (https://onerepo.tools/plugins/jest/, https://onerepo.tools/plugins/vitest/).
  - (e) none. (f) none.
  - (g) yes: `one generate` from templates (https://onerepo.tools/core/generate/), CODEOWNERS sync/verify (https://onerepo.tools/core/codeowners/), TypeScript plugin syncs project references (https://onerepo.tools/plugins/typescript/).
- Final: exit at G3 (confusion: config reference examples contradict documented key paths).

### sportradar/elixir-workspace

- Latest release: no GitHub releases; newest tag `workspace/v0.3.2` (2026-08-05)
- Archived: false
- G1 pass (monorepo manager).
  "`mix workspace.run` allows you to: Run a task against all or a subset of projects. Run tasks only on projects based on their status and workspace graph topology." (https://hexdocs.pm/workspace/readme.html)
- G2 pass: MIT license file in `workspace/` covers the tool.
- G3 exit (confusion).
  - Coverage was otherwise met: config reference https://hexdocs.pm/workspace/Workspace.Config.html, CLI reference https://hexdocs.pm/workspace/Mix.Tasks.Workspace.Run.html, custom checks behaviour https://hexdocs.pm/workspace/Workspace.Check.html.
  - Confusion trigger (feature referenced but not documented anywhere): https://hexdocs.pm/workspace/Workspace.Config.html says the config file is the place to "Define any other configuration option may be needed by a third party plugin", and the module docs refer to "various plugins or mix tasks" defining options.
    No page explains what a workspace plugin is, how one is loaded, or how it reads these options; the only extension doc is custom checks.
  - Structure signal: navigation is the ExDoc module list (Workspace, Check APIs, Checks, Utilities, Test Coverage, Testing, plus task pages) with a single Overview guide; no guide ties features together.
  - No-JS check: Config and workspace.run pages 200, text present.
- G4
  - (d) none. (e) none. (f) none.
  - (g) partial: `mix workspace.check` enforces project config rules (dependency versions, boundaries) rather than files; `workspace_new` installer scaffolds a new workspace (README).
- Final: exit at G3 (confusion: "third party plugin" referenced with no plugin documentation).

  - (b) present: https://pacwich.dev/cli/commands and https://pacwich.dev/api/reference.
  - (c) missing: no plugin, hook, or extension mechanism documented; the TypeScript API is a consumer library, not a way to add behavior to pacwich. Searches of the docs source (`workspaces/web/documentation-website/src`) for plugin/extension/hook found none.
  - No-JS check: CLI commands, config, API reference pages 200, text present.
- G4
  - (d) no native watch; `--watch` appears only as an argument passed through to a user script in a `run-interactive` example.
  - (e) `pacwich mcp-server` serves documentation resources over stdio (https://pacwich.dev/ai/mcp), not a running-watch inspection channel.
  - (f) none.

- Archived: false
- G1 exit (category mismatch).
  README: "Fnug is a TUI command runner that automatically selects and executes lint and test commands based on git changes or file watching. Think of it as a terminal multiplexer".
  Its "Workspace support" only "discover[s] and merge[s] `.fnug.yaml` files from subdirectories ... as child groups"; `depends_on` links commands, not projects, so there is no project model or project relationships.
  Not a component either: the watch loop lives inside the TUI with no documented RPC/IPC/HTTP channel.
  An `fnug mcp` stdio server exists in source (`src/mcp.rs`, tools `list_lints`, `run_lint`, `run_all`) and is mentioned only in the contributor file `CLAUDE.md`; it runs commands itself instead of attaching to a running TUI.
- G2 to G3: not reached.
- G4 notes: (d) watch auto-selects commands on file change (README "File watching"); (e)/(f) nothing documented; (g) `fnug init-hooks` installs a git pre-commit hook.
- Final: exit at G1 (TUI command runner, no project model).

  - Official docs are the README, a small wiki (pages "Partial builds", "Reusing package selectors", "Task annexes"), and an "API Documentation" link.
  - (a)/(b): no consolidated configuration or options reference; options such as `--batch-parallel`, `--all`, `--with-deps` appear only inside narrative examples in https://github.com/run-z/run-z#readme.
  - (c): no extension mechanism documented.
  - Confusion trigger: the "API Documentation" link https://run-z.github.io/run-z/ renders the README again inside TypeDoc chrome with no API members.
  - No-JS check: repo page and wiki page 200, text present.

  - (b) present: https://jchip.github.io/fynpo/docs/commands/run and sibling command pages.
  - (c) missing: no plugin or extension mechanism in any page (sidebar: Fynpo, Getting Started, Commands).
  - Confusion signals: the configuration page never names the config file; only the bootstrap page mentions `fynpo.config.js` or `fynpo.json`. The reference sits under "Getting Started". README docs link targets `jchip.github.io/fynpo` while the repo homepage field is `electrode.io/fynpo`.

  - Confusion triggers in https://github.com/Farfetch/garment/blob/master/docs/CLI.md: the `action-graph` section shows usage `garment dep-graph <taskName> <projectName>`; the `tasks <project-name>` section appears twice with different usage lines (`garment tasks my-app` and `garment tasks`).
  - Structure signal: watch behavior is split across three files with no tying page.
  - No-JS check: repo page and `docs/CLI.md` blob page 200, text present.
- G4
  - (d) yes: `--watch` re-executes tasks on input change; `skipWatch` per task (Configuration.md).

- G2 pass: BSD-3-Clause license file.
- G3 exit (coverage (a) and confusion).
  - (a) missing: no configuration reference; `qik.toml` keys are spread across guide pages (commands, spaces, context, caching, plugin pages). Site nav has Guide, Cookbook, Blog, Roadmap, Release Notes, Contributing, and no Reference section.
  - (b) no full CLI reference: https://qik.build/en/stable/guide/ lists core flags and defers to the runner section; `-v`, `-l`, `--isolated`, `--cache-status` appear only in narrative text.
  - (c) present: https://qik.build/en/stable/plugin_intro/
  - (d) watch claimed; behavior doc is one sentence: "Use `--watch` to reactively re-run commands based on file changes" (https://qik.build/en/stable/commands/#watching-for-changes).
  - Confusion trigger: the guide's "See the command runner section" links to `../commands/#runner`, but the section anchor is `#the-command-runner`, so the link lands at the page top.

  - Confusion trigger: README "Warning" section on https://github.com/bazurbat/jagen says "The documentation about rules is now mostly obsolete. The latest stable version before the rewrite was moved to the `legacy` branch." The rules doc (`doc/Rules.md`) is the configuration reference, so the reference is self-declared stale for current `master`.

  - Options table says `port` is "Only relevant in combination with the `--visualize`-parameter", but `visualize` is a first positional parameter, not a flag.
  - No-JS check: repo page 200, text present.
- G4: (d) none; (e) `visualize` starts a local server serving the graph, not a watch process; (f) none; (g) the `@yanice/import-boundaries` plugin can generate dependency graphs for `yanice.json` (README).
- Final: exit at G3 (confusion: broken config example link; plugin API only in fixtures).

  - Structure signal: the site sidebar ends with "Full README" linking out to GitHub, and design decisions such as deferred watch mode live only in `docs/DESIGN.md` outside the site.
  - No-JS check: configuration and reference pages 200, text present.
- G4
  - (d) none; `docs/DESIGN.md` lists watch mode under "Deferred" and suggests `watchexec -- trellis run test`.
  - (e) none. (f) none.
  - (g) partial: `trellis init` writes the `[tools.trellis]` table; changelog rendering from fragments via minijinja templates (https://trellis.tylerbutler.com/docs/changelog/); `doctor` validation.

- G2 pass: MIT license file.
- G3 exit (confusion and coverage (c)).
  - Confusion trigger: README line 9 "See the [tutorial](#tutorial) below for a practical walkthrough" links to a `#tutorial` anchor that does not exist in https://github.com/pnordahl/monorail#readme; the tutorial is the separate `TUTORIAL.md`, linked later.
  - (c) missing by design: README says it composes with tools "without the need for bespoke rules or plugins", and no extension mechanism is documented.
  - (a) and (b) present in README ("Config", per-feature "APIs" sections) and `Monorail.reference.js`.
  - No-JS check: repo page 200, text present.
- G4: (d) none; (e) none; (f) none; (g) `config generate` produces config (README "`config generate`").
