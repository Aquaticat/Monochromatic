# Monorepo manager screening, registry chunk 2

Screened 2026-09-16.
Input: `screening-registry-chunk-2.json` (68 candidates).
No candidate tool was installed or executed.

Evidence sources:

- npm registry JSON (`https://registry.npmjs.org/<pkg>`): latest version and publish time, `license`, `repository`, `deprecated`, README.
  No candidate's latest npm version carries a `deprecated` flag.
- `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>` (license detection, `archived`, `pushed_at`), `/releases`, `/tags`, recursive git trees (license-file presence), and raw file contents.
- Forgejo API for `git.fallet.net`, GitLab API for `gitlab.com`.
- Docs pages were fetched once with `curl --location --silent --show-error --user-agent 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:130.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/130.0' <url>`; visible text is the HTML with scripts, styles, and tags removed.
  GitHub repo and blob pages return server-rendered README text (HTTP 200) under this command.
  npm package pages do not: https://www.npmjs.com/package/workgraph returned HTTP 403 with "Just a moment... Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue".
  So an npm-only package whose README exists only on npmjs.com has no human-readable docs under the no-JS rule.

Interpretation notes applied to every candidate:

- G1 monorepo manager requires the docs to show relationship-aware execution across projects (dependency order, dependency cascade, or `^task` dependencies).
  Tools that fan the same command out to every folder or package without using relationships are category mismatches.
- G1 "provisional pass": when a package's docs are empty or too thin to show its category, but its self-description claims monorepo management, G1 is recorded as provisional and the later gates decide.
  G1 fails outright only when the docs positively describe a different category.
- G2 follows chunk 1: a license file must exist in an accessible source repository.
  A license declared only in the npm manifest or README counts as missing; each such exit lists its G3 outcome as incidental, so no final outcome depends on this reading.
- G3 official docs exclude source files, issues, chat, and blogs.
  Confusion rule: the first confusion trigger ends the read, recorded with URL.
  No-JS rule (user rule change, applied to all candidates): a bot block, 403/429/202, or JS shell without docs text is an immediate G3 exit.
- Once a gate fails, later gates are not evaluated; G4 lists only evidence already gathered, marked "incidental".

### workspaces-filter

- URL: https://github.com/tunnckoCore/workspaces-filter
- License: MIT (`LICENSE` at repo root)
- Latest release: v0.8.7, 2025-12-01
- Archived: no
- G1: fail, category mismatch.
  - README describes "A companion for filtering monorepo workspaces, by package name or package dir ... Useful for running scripts on a subset of workspaces" (https://github.com/tunnckoCore/workspaces-filter#readme).
  - Selection is by name or directory glob only; neither the CLI help nor the `filter`/`runCommandOn` API docs mention dependency order or any relationship between packages.
- G2: not evaluated.
- G3: not evaluated.
  Incidental: even under a looser G1 it would exit on coverage, with no configuration reference and no extension mechanism in the README (its only doc).
- G4: not evaluated.
- Final: exit at G1 (workspace filter plus script fan-out, no relationship-aware execution).

### mr-yarn

- URL: https://github.com/leecheneler/mr-yarn
- License: MIT (`LICENSE`)
- Latest release: 1.0.0-alpha.11 (prerelease), 2018-10-31
- Archived: yes
- G1: fail, category mismatch.
  - README `run` section: "Run NPM scripts in workspaces. **Currently all scripts are run in parallel all the time.**" (https://github.com/leecheneler/mr-yarn#run).
  - Only `add` looks at local workspace dependencies; task running ignores relationships.
- G2, G3, G4: not evaluated.
- Final: exit at G1 (parallel script fan-out over Yarn workspaces; archived).

### workspace-builder

- URL: https://github.com/suchipi/workspace-builder
- License: MIT (`packages/workspace-builder/LICENSE`; no root license file)
- Latest release: npm 1.0.2, 2021-02-16 (no GitHub releases)
- Archived: no
- G1: pass (minimal), monorepo manager.
  - https://github.com/suchipi/workspace-builder/tree/master/packages/workspace-builder: runs the builder modules named in each Yarn workspace's `package.json`, passing `dependsOn: Array<Workspace>` ("workspace packages that this workspace has in its package.json dependencies").
- G2: pass. MIT license file in the tool's package directory.
- G3: fail, confusion.
  - Trigger: the same page says "It also has a watch mode where it does the same thing, but watches each workspace directory's `src` dir", yet no command, flag, or option to enable it appears anywhere in the docs.
    No-JS check: HTTP 200, text present.
  - The repo root README points to the package README as plain text ("See packages/workspace-builder/README.md for more info.") rather than a link.
  - Coverage would also fail on (b): no CLI reference.
- G4 (incidental):
  - d: claimed watch mode, undocumented invocation.
  - e, f: none.
  - g: none.
- Final: exit at G3 confusion (watch mode claimed with no documented way to enable it).

### kodrdriv tree (@grunnverk/tree-execution, @grunnverk/commands-tree)

- URL: https://github.com/grunnverk/tree-execution
- License: `@grunnverk/tree-execution` MIT (`LICENSE`); `@grunnverk/commands-tree` Apache-2.0 (https://github.com/grunnverk/commands-tree)
- Latest release: tree-execution v1.5.8, 2026-03-27; commands-tree npm 1.5.14, 2026-03-27
- Archived: no
- G1: fail, category mismatch (library plus add-on of another tool).
  - tree-execution README: "A sophisticated parallel execution framework ... Originally developed as part of the kodrdriv toolkit, this library has been extracted for standalone use"; usage is only programmatic (`createTreeExecutor`, `DynamicTaskPool`).
  - commands-tree npm description: "Tree and dependency management commands for kodrdriv", a command module for the host CLI.
  - The host CLI kodrdriv (https://github.com/grunnverk/kodrdriv) describes itself as "an AI-powered Git workflow automation tool that generates intelligent commit messages and release notes"; `kodrdriv tree` is one subcommand family.
- G2, G3: not evaluated.
  Incidental: kodrdriv's designated docs site https://grunnverk.github.io/kodrdriv/ returned HTTP 200 with 619 bytes whose only visible text is "🚀 KodrDriv - Intelligent Git Release Notes" (JS shell), so screening kodrdriv itself would exit at G3 no-JS.
- G4: not evaluated.
- Final: exit at G1 (execution library and kodrdriv command module).

### @jacob-ebey/mono-build

- URL: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jacob-ebey/mono-build
- License: WTFPL (npm manifest only)
- Latest release: npm 0.0.8, 2018-09-10
- Archived: n/a (no repository)
- G1: pass (borderline), monorepo manager.
  - npm README: `mono.json` lists packages, "the build order is defined by the order of the packages in mono.json"; commands install and link packages to each other and run a script "in each project in order".
  - The order is a hand-written list, not derived relationships; linking does use inter-package relationships.
- G2: fail. No `repository` field in the npm manifest; `gh api repos/jacob-ebey/mono-build` returns 404 and a repository search under `user:jacob-ebey` returns nothing.
- G3: not evaluated.
  Incidental: the README exists only on npmjs.com, which blocks plain curl (HTTP 403).
- G4: not evaluated.
- Final: exit at G2 (no source repository).

### verify-grid

- URL: https://github.com/kirull1/verify-grid
- License: MIT in npm manifest and README badge; no license file in repo (GitHub license detection none, tree has no license file)
- Latest release: npm 0.4.0, 2026-01-25 (no GitHub releases)
- Archived: no
- G1: fail, category mismatch.
  - README: "Run matrix of tasks across services with parallel execution and live status reporting"; `services` are `{ name, cwd }` entries and ordering comes from per-task `priority` (https://github.com/kirull1/verify-grid#-configuration).
  - No relationship between services is modeled; it is a task-matrix runner.
- G2, G3, G4: not evaluated.
- Final: exit at G1 (task by service matrix runner without project relationships).

### buildsure

- URL: https://github.com/clasen/BuildSure
- License: MIT in npm manifest and README; no license file in repo
- Latest release: npm 0.6.0, 2026-09-07 (no GitHub releases)
- Archived: no
- G1: fail, category mismatch.
  - README: "If `[path]` contains a `package.json`, it builds that project. Otherwise it iterates immediate subdirectories that have `package.json` + a `build` script." (https://github.com/clasen/BuildSure#cli).
  - It is an mtime-gated install-and-build wrapper per folder with no relationships between projects.
- G2, G3, G4: not evaluated.
- Final: exit at G1 (per-folder conditional build wrapper).

### kitchen-tools

- URL: https://github.com/JacopoPatroclo/kitchen-tools
- License: MIT in npm manifest; no license file in repo
- Latest release: v0.7.0, 2020-10-23
- Archived: no (last push 2022-12-06)
- G1: fail, category mismatch.
  - README: "Set of tools to generate and run docker-composes service oriented projects"; `bake` scaffolds services and `oven` "under the hood it uses docker-compose" (https://github.com/JacopoPatroclo/kitchen-tools#documentation).
  - Scaffolder plus docker-compose wrapper; no task execution across projects.
- G2, G3, G4: not evaluated.
- Final: exit at G1 (scaffolder and docker-compose wrapper).

### workgraph

- URL: https://www.npmjs.com/package/workgraph
- License: MIT (npm manifest only)
- Latest release: npm 0.0.9, 2026-01-20
- Archived: n/a (no repository)
- G1: pass, monorepo manager.
  - npm README: "Scans workspace projects and builds a directed dependency graph", "Determines which projects are affected by changes (transitive dependents)", "Uses Kahn's algorithm to plan build waves".
- G2: fail. No `repository` or `homepage` field in the npm manifest, and a GitHub repository search for `workgraph in:name` returns only unrelated projects (aiidateam/aiida-workgraph, GPUOpen WorkGraph samples).
- G3: not evaluated.
  Incidental: the README exists only on npmjs.com, which returned HTTP 403 "Just a moment... Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue" to plain curl (no-JS exit); it also links `./RELEASING.md`, which has no target on npm.
- G4 (incidental, npm README):
  - d: `workgraph watch` rebuilds affected projects on change and can start dev servers.
  - e, f: none documented (terminal UI only).
  - g: `workgraph.sources` runs configured code generators before dependent builds.
- Final: exit at G2 (no source repository).

### affected-ci

- URL: https://github.com/Cst2989/affected-ci
- License: MIT (`LICENSE`)
- Latest release: v1.0.2, 2026-07-28
- Archived: no
- G1: fail, category mismatch.
  - README: "Run lint, typecheck, tests and Playwright specs on only what your diff can reach — derived from your import graph, with no workspaces required" and "it works in a single app in a single repo with no package boundaries at all" (https://github.com/Cst2989/affected-ci#readme).
  - It selects files from a module import graph and passes them to fixed tool tiers; there is no workspace-of-projects model.
- G2, G3, G4: not evaluated.
- Final: exit at G1 (file-level affected selector, no project model).

### @monoloom/cli

- URL: https://git.fallet.net/monoloom/workspace
- License: GPL-3.0 (`LICENSE` at repo root, https://git.fallet.net/monoloom/workspace/raw/branch/main/LICENSE)
- Latest release: v1.0.1, 2026-06-07 (Forgejo releases API)
- Archived: no
- G1: pass, monorepo manager.
  - README: `npx monoloom affected:<npm-script-name>` "will calculate your dependency graph based on what you have declared in the `dependencies` key of your `package.json` files, then execute the provided npm script in a fail fast way".
- G2: pass. GPL-3.0 license file in the source repository.
- G3: fail, confusion.
  - Trigger: https://git.fallet.net/monoloom/workspace (README "Github Actions/Forgejo Actions usage") runs `npx workspace-tools affected:lint`, while "Usage" documents the command as `npx monoloom affected:<npm-script-name>`; the docs never mention a `workspace-tools` binary.
    No-JS check: HTTP 200, README text present after the Forgejo "This website requires JavaScript." banner.
  - Also contradictory: the example says "The `test-billing` workspace declares a dependency to the `application` workspace" while its JSON declares `"billing": "*"`.
  - Coverage would also fail on (a) and (c): the tool is zero-config with no configuration reference and has no extension mechanism.
- G4 (incidental):
  - d, e, f: none.
  - g: writes `.workspaces-state` at the repo root after each successful run.
- Final: exit at G3 confusion (CI example uses an undocumented `workspace-tools` command name).

### @blaze-js/cli

- URL: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blaze-js/cli
- License: ISC (npm manifest only)
- Latest release: npm 0.0.5, 2022-09-11
- Archived: n/a (no repository)
- G1: provisional pass. The npm packument has no README ("ERROR: No README data found!"); the only category signal is the description "Monorepo manager".
- G2: fail. No `repository` field; a GitHub repository search for `blaze-js in:name` returns only unrelated projects.
- G3: not evaluated. Incidental: no docs exist.
- G4: not evaluated.
- Final: exit at G2 (no source repository; also no docs).

### nasti-task (Nasti Plus)

- URL: https://github.com/nasti-toolchain/nasti-task
- License: MIT (`LICENSE`)
- Latest release: npm `@nasti-toolchain/nasti-task` 0.1.0, 2026-07-28 (no GitHub releases)
- Archived: no
- G1: pass, monorepo manager.
  - README: "the dependency-aware monorepo task runner behind `np run` ... provides package graph scheduling"; config example uses `"dependsOn": ["^build"]`.
- G2: pass. MIT license file.
- G3: fail, confusion and coverage.
  - Trigger: https://github.com/nasti-toolchain/nasti-task quick start runs `nt run -r build` and `nt run @scope/app#build`, but neither `-r` nor the `#` target syntax is explained anywhere; the README's behavior summary defers to "inspired by Vite Task" and "behind `np run`" with no link.
    No-JS check: HTTP 200, text present.
  - Coverage: no CLI reference (b), no configuration reference beyond one example (a), no extension mechanism (c). The README is the only doc (repo tree has `README.md` and `LICENSE` only).
- G4: not evaluated.
- Final: exit at G3 confusion (undocumented CLI flag and target syntax; README is the only doc).

### Hark (@hark/plugin-monorepo)

- URL: https://github.com/sparebytes/hark
- License: MIT (`LICENSE`)
- Latest release: tag v0.11.5 (no GitHub releases); npm `@hark/plugin-monorepo` 0.11.4, 2020-04-26

  - README: "Hark - The Reactive Task Runner ... Powered by RxJS ... Hard-forked from nextools @start ... See ./harkfile.ts for an example." (https://github.com/sparebytes/hark#readme).
  - Hark is a generic task runner; monorepo support is a plugin (`@hark/plugin-monorepo`) whose npm packument has no README and whose description reads "🐣 Spawn new child process".
- G2, G3, G4: not evaluated.
- Final: exit at G1 (generic task runner; the monorepo part is an undocumented plugin; archived).

### gmm

- URL: https://github.com/k-koehler/gmm
- License: MIT (npm manifest only)
- Latest release: npm 0.0.3, 2021-09-19
- Archived: n/a (repository missing)
- G1: provisional pass. No README in the npm packument; description "GMM Monoepo Manager".
- G2: fail. `gh api repos/k-koehler/gmm` returns 404 and the user's public repo list has no `gmm`.
- G3: not evaluated. Incidental: no docs exist.
- G4: not evaluated.
- Final: exit at G2 (source repository missing; also no docs).

### rumos

- URL: https://github.com/remirobichet/rumos
- License: MIT in npm manifest; no license file in repo (tree: 6 entries, none a license)
- Latest release: npm 0.2.1, 2023-05-16
- Archived: no
- G1: provisional pass. README: "CLI tool to run faster monorepo scripts"; usage is only `pnpm rumos`.
- G2: fail. No license file in the repository.
- G3: not evaluated.
  Incidental: the README (https://github.com/remirobichet/rumos#readme) documents nothing beyond install and `pnpm rumos`, so it would also exit at G3.
- G4: not evaluated.
- Final: exit at G2 (no license file; docs are one command).

### npm-mono-repo (Sodaru)

- URL: https://github.com/sodaru/mono-repo
- License: MIT (`LICENSE`)
- Latest release: tag v1.2.0; npm 1.2.0, 2022-09-27
- Archived: no
- G1: pass, monorepo manager.
  - README `run`: "Runs the npm script in every (or selected) package (**In the 'dependency first' order**)"; `publish` also runs in dependency-first order.
- G2: pass. MIT license file.
- G3: fail, confusion.
  - Trigger: https://github.com/sodaru/mono-repo `create` "creates a new package at `packagesDir/packageDirName`", but `packagesDir` is not defined or configurable anywhere in the docs.
    No-JS check: HTTP 200, text present.
  - Coverage would also fail on (a) and (c): no configuration reference, no extension mechanism.
- G4: not evaluated.
- Final: exit at G3 confusion (undefined `packagesDir` setting).

### @yamato-daiwa/monorepo-helper

- Archived: no
- G1: fail, category mismatch.
  - README: "The alternative approach to npm workspaces, pnpm, yarn workspaces and Lerna ... Using symlinks during local development"; the only commands are `ydmh version` (set versions, rewrite internal deps to relative paths, `npm install`, `npm audit fix`) and `ydmh publish` (build all, then publish sequentially).
  - It is a linking, versioning, and publishing helper; it runs no user-selected tasks, and builds run in `packages` list order.
- G2, G3: not evaluated.
  Incidental confusion triggers: the install command names `@yamato-daiwa/yamato-daiwa-monorepo-helper` while the package is `@yamato-daiwa/monorepo-helper`, and the publish heading reads `ydmn publish`.
- G4: not evaluated.
- Final: exit at G1 (link, version, and publish helper).

- G1: provisional pass. README: "a powerful and feature-rich tool used for handling, managing and scaling monorepositories"; no task-running behavior is described.
- G2: pass. MIT license file.
- G3: fail, confusion.
  - Trigger: the README sends readers to "the [wiki] and the [docs](./docs/README.md)"; `[wiki]` has no link target, and https://github.com/nikeokoronkwo/rex/blob/main/docs/README.md is 11 bytes containing only "# Rex Docs".
    No-JS check: HTTP 200, text present.
  - https://github.com/nikeokoronkwo/rex/blob/main/docs/hooks.md ends its list sentence "The Git Hooks supported by Rex are:" with no list.
- G4: not evaluated.
- Final: exit at G3 confusion (empty docs index, truncated hooks page, dead wiki link).

### fraktos

- URL: https://github.com/holasoymalva/fraktos
- License: MIT in npm manifest and README; no license file in repo
- Latest release: npm 0.1.0, 2026-06-08
- Archived: no
- G1: pass (minimal), monorepo manager.
  - README: `fraktos.config.json` lists projects with `path`, `command`, and `depends_on`; it "launches them in a coordinated, dependency-aware DAG".
  - One command per project and no RPC/IPC/HTTP interface (only an in-process API), so it is not a component.
- G2: fail. No license file; the README license badge links to `https://github.com/fraktos/fraktos/blob/main/LICENSE`, a different repository.
- G3: not evaluated.
  Incidental: no extension mechanism documented (c) and no CLI reference beyond `--config`.
- G4: not evaluated.
- Final: exit at G2 (no license file).

### robonaut

- License: MIT (npm manifest; https://github.com/f1lt3r/robonaut redirects to markserv/robonaut, whose license GitHub detects as MIT)
- Latest release: npm 2.2.1-alpha.0, 2017-01-13 (markserv/robonaut last push 2017-02-10)
- Archived: listed URL returns 404; markserv/robonaut not archived
- G1: fail, category mismatch.
  - npm README: commands `embed`, `prime`, `assemble` (git clone and npm install dependencies), `fuse` (`npm link`), `scan` (git diff), `numerate` (version bumps), `transmit` (git push and npm publish).
  - It is a multi-repo clone, link, and release helper; it runs no tasks across projects.

  - The repo homepage field points to https://www.npmjs.com/package/antiscaler, a different package name.
- G4: not evaluated.
- Final: exit at G3 confusion (getting-started run output contradicts `dependsOn` semantics).

### reckon (@andrew24601/reckon)

- URL: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@andrew24601/reckon
- License: MIT (npm manifest; source https://github.com/andrew24601/reckon found by repository search)
- Latest release: npm 0.1.2, 2026-05-14
- Archived: no
- G1: fail, category mismatch (library).
  - npm README: "Reckon is a library-first incremental build system ... It currently does not include a standalone CLI, watch mode"; builds are JS task graphs with C and macOS app helpers, with no workspace model.
- G2, G3, G4: not evaluated.
  Incidental: the README installs `reckon` (`npm install --save-dev reckon`), not the published name `@andrew24601/reckon`.
- Final: exit at G1 (build-graph library).

### nalth

- URL: https://www.nalthjs.com
- License: MIT (`LICENSE` in https://github.com/nalikiru-dev/Nalth.js)
- Latest release: npm 0.9.0, 2025-12-19 (GitHub tag v2.2.0)
- Archived: no
- G1: fail, category mismatch.
  - npm README: "the world's first security-first web development framework ... powered by a security-enhanced Vite.js foundation"; `nalth run build` is one command of a single-app toolchain, with no workspace-of-projects model.
- G2, G3, G4: not evaluated.
  Incidental: https://www.nalthjs.com/ returned HTTP 200 with visible text only "nalth — Real Estate Commission Reconciliation", which is not the project's docs.
- Final: exit at G1 (single-app web toolchain).

### machora

- URL: https://github.com/jasonz1987/machora
- License: Apache-2.0 (`LICENSE`)
- Latest release: npm 0.8.1, 2026-09-02 (no GitHub releases)
- Archived: no
- G1: fail, category mismatch.
  - README: "A lightweight, self-hosted development workload orchestrator that turns spare Macs, Windows PCs, and Linux servers into Git-native task machines"; "A project is a local Git repository associated with one task machine".
  - Projects are independent repositories with no inter-project relationships.
    The controller has a local HTTP API (`/api/*`, `http://127.0.0.1:4178`) but watches nothing: jobs start from the CLI, dashboard, or Git push hooks. So it is neither a monorepo manager nor a watch component.
- G2, G3, G4: not evaluated.
- Final: exit at G1 (remote job orchestrator).
