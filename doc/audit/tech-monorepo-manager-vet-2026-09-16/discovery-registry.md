# Monorepo manager discovery registry

Discovery run date: 2026-09-16.
Scope: candidate monorepo managers (task/build orchestrators that run arbitrary command tasks across workspace packages) and component tools that provide a persistent watch or process with an inspection surface that could compose with one.
Screening used registry metadata only (name, description, keywords, last publish, repository link).
No primary-source verification (README, docs, source) was done for any candidate in this round.

Definitions used in this file:

- **result**: one package or crate object returned by the provider on that page.
- **new names**: results whose package or crate name had not appeared on any earlier page of the frozen schedule (schedule order Q1 to Q8).
- **new screening survivors**: distinct tools (package families collapsed, forks and mirrors merged) first recorded as survivors on that page.
- **survivor**: the registry description itself claims a category function (runs tasks across packages, build orchestration, task runner, or a persistent watch/process with dashboard, daemon, monitor or API).
- **survivor (unverified)**: the description plausibly fits but is vague, very short, or has no repository link; verify first in the next round.
- **generic task runner**: a Make/Task/just-class runner with no stated workspace graph.
  It was kept because the brief lists Task as an in-scope example.
- **excluded**: out of category (library, template/scaffold, bundler, package-manager-only, CI service, release/versioning tool, linter, agent orchestration, cron/job queue, script picker, delegating command router, add-on of another manager, multi-repo tool, insufficient description).
- Archived or abandoned status is noted, never a disqualifier.

## Query ledger

### Q1: npm keywords:monorepo

- Literal URL: `https://registry.npmjs.org/-/v1/search?text=keywords:monorepo&size=250&popularity=1.0&quality=0.0&maintenance=0.0&from=<N>`
- Provider: npm registry search API
- Filters: `keywords:monorepo`
- Sort: popularity weight 1.0, quality 0.0, maintenance 0.0
- Pages fetched: 0 to 17 (from=0 to from=4250)
- Provider total: 4145 on pages 0 and 1, 4146 on pages 2 to 17 (the live index grew during the run)
- Rate limiting: pages 14 to 16 first returned HTTP 429; they were refetched successfully with 8 s spacing a few minutes later.
  The refetch introduces a small ordering-drift risk at those offsets.
- Spam: pages 2 to 7 were dominated by lorem-ipsum scoped packages published 2024-04/05 (1121 hidden across the query by a scope/name/date filter during review).
  An audit of every hidden description for task, runner, build system, build tool, orchestrat, watch or daemon signals found one hit, a copied release-it README (spam).
- Per page (results / new names / new screening survivors):
  - p0: 250 / 250 / 18
  - p1: 250 / 250 / 11
  - p2: 250 / 249 / 11
  - p3: 250 / 250 / 3
  - p4: 250 / 250 / 0
  - p5: 250 / 250 / 1
  - p6: 250 / 250 / 3
  - p7: 250 / 250 / 4
  - p8: 250 / 250 / 15
  - p9: 250 / 250 / 17
  - p10: 250 / 250 / 12
  - p11: 250 / 250 / 20
  - p12: 250 / 250 / 9
  - p13: 250 / 250 / 13
  - p14: 250 / 250 / 12
  - p15: 250 / 250 / 7
  - p16: 146 / 146 / 5
  - p17: 0 / 0 / 0
- Stop reason: exhausted (p16 partial, p17 empty).
  Never saturated: p4 had no survivor, but p5 did, so two consecutive empty pages never occurred.
- Coverage gap: `nx`, `turbo`, `wireit`, `lage` and `@moonrepo/cli` do not appear in any npm result page of Q1, Q2 or Q3 (checked by exact name against every saved page), so npm keyword metadata misses several major tools.

### Q2: npm keywords:build-system

- Literal URL: `https://registry.npmjs.org/-/v1/search?text=keywords:build-system&size=250&popularity=1.0&quality=0.0&maintenance=0.0&from=<N>`
- Provider: npm registry search API
- Filters: `keywords:build-system`
- Sort: popularity weight 1.0, quality 0.0, maintenance 0.0
- Pages fetched: 0 and 1
- Provider total: 48
- Per page (results / new names / new screening survivors):
  - p0: 48 / 36 / 5 (12 names already seen in Q1: `@front-ops/domino`, `@nu-art/build-and-install`, three `@fabr-build/*`, `@fiducial/fiducial`, `monox` and four `@monoxon/*` binaries, `@monoloom/cli`)
  - p1: 0 / 0 / 0
- Stop reason: exhausted (single partial page, then empty).

### Q3: npm keywords:task-runner

- Literal URL: `https://registry.npmjs.org/-/v1/search?text=keywords:task-runner&size=250&popularity=1.0&quality=0.0&maintenance=0.0&from=<N>`
- Provider: npm registry search API
- Filters: `keywords:task-runner`
- Sort: popularity weight 1.0, quality 0.0, maintenance 0.0
- Pages fetched: 0 to 2
- Provider total: 330
- Per page (results / new names / new screening survivors):
  - p0: 250 / 223 / 44 (27 names already seen in Q1 or Q2)
  - p1: 80 / 76 / 13 (4 names already seen: `ditoh`, `repo-runner`, `@osndot/osn`, `sleetrepo`)
  - p2: 0 / 0 / 0
- Stop reason: exhausted.
- Noise profile: the keyword is shared by AI-agent task loops, job queues, cron schedulers and Hardhat (smart-contract) forks; all excluded.

### Q4: crates.io q=build system

- Literal URL: `https://crates.io/api/v1/crates?q=build%20system&sort=downloads&per_page=100&page=<N>`
- Provider: crates.io API, User-Agent `monochromatic-vet-discovery`
- Filters: full-text `build system`
- Sort: downloads
- Pages fetched: 1 and 2
- Provider total: 30451
- Per page (results / new names / new screening survivors):
  - p1: 100 / 100 / 0 (hashbrown, syn, getrandom, libc, tokio and similar top-downloaded libraries)
  - p2: 100 / 100 / 0 (system-deps, tauri family, diesel and similar)
- Stop reason: saturated (two consecutive complete pages with no survivor).
- Relevance caveat: under download sort the query matches the broad tokens, so any real build systems in the 30451 results are buried far below the pages the rule allowed.
  Treat this source as low-yield rather than as evidence of absence.

### Q5: crates.io q=task runner

- Literal URL: `https://crates.io/api/v1/crates?q=task%20runner&sort=downloads&per_page=100&page=<N>`

- Per page (results / new names / new screening survivors):
  - p1: 100 / 98 / 10
  - p2: 100 / 100 / 19
  - p3: 100 / 100 / 15
  - p4: 100 / 100 / 12 (cargo-rssc also matched but is merged into the cargo-auto entry)
  - p5: 100 / 100 / 5
  - p6: 100 / 100 / 2
  - p7: 100 / 99 / 2
  - p8: 100 / 100 / 6

  - p13: 100 / 100 / 3
  - p14: 100 / 99 / 2
  - p15: 100 / 100 / 7
  - p16: 100 / 100 / 7
  - p17: 100 / 100 / 5
  - p18: 71 / 70 / 1
  - p19: 0 / 0 / 0
- Stop reason: exhausted (never two consecutive pages without a survivor).
- Noise profile: AI agent runtimes, async executors, embedded crates and rCore tutorial crates.

### Q6: crates.io q=monorepo

- Literal URL: `https://crates.io/api/v1/crates?q=monorepo&sort=downloads&per_page=100&page=<N>`
- Provider: crates.io API, User-Agent `monochromatic-vet-discovery`

  - p6: 100 / 91 / 1
  - p7: 100 / 93 / 0
  - p8: 100 / 90 / 0
- Stop reason: saturated (p7 and p8 complete pages with no new survivor).
- Noise profile: large library families that live in monorepos (nym, zebra, aprender, hjkl, libreoffice-rs `lo_*`, fallow, stac, taceo) plus release/versioning tools.

### Q7: monorepo.tools comparison

- Literal URLs: `https://monorepo.tools` (no comparison table; it links to `/compare`) and `https://monorepo.tools/compare`
- Provider: monorepo.tools (Nx team site), fetched with WebFetch and cross-checked against raw HTML from curl (HTTP 200, 633312 bytes for `/compare`)

- Filters / sort: none (single document, 171 lines)
- Sections screened: Build systems & dependency management tools (24 entries), Repository management tools (10 entries, `oao` listed twice), Version control systems & add-ons tools (Git 14 entries, Mercurial 1 entry), Development process tools: CI tools (6 entries), Migration tools (5 entries).
  Good reads, code review, code ownership, notable public monorepos and development workflows were read and hold no tools in category.

- Saturated sources: Q4, Q6.
- Exhausted sources: Q1, Q2, Q3, Q5, Q7, Q8.
- Blocked sources: none (the npm 429s on Q1 were transient and resolved by retry; no provider capped results before saturation or exhaustion).

## Candidates

Entry format: name, URL, discovered by (query and page), category guess, screening note, taxonomy terms seen.
Unless noted, "last" dates are the last registry publish, not repository activity.
