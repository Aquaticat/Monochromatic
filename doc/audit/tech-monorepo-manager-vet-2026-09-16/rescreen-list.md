# Re-screen list after dropping requirement (c)

Classification of every G3 exit in the eight screening inputs
(`screening-primary-chunk-{1,2,3}.md`, `screening-registry-chunk-{1,2,3}.md`, `screening-promoted-runners.md`, and the `## Screening` section of `discovery-expansion.md`).
G1 exits, G2 exits, and user exclusions are ignored.
Machine-readable RESCREEN list: `rescreen-list.json`.

## Counts

- G3 exits read: 151
  - primary chunk 1: 23; primary chunk 2: 16; primary chunk 3: 17
  - registry chunk 1: 36; registry chunk 2: 14; registry chunk 3: 18
  - promoted runners: 10; discovery expansion: 17
- RESCREEN: 20 (6 of them borderline)
- STAYS OUT: 131

## RESCREEN

- folke/ultra-runner (primary 1): (c) only. Borderline: (a) annotated "partial" but not listed as failing.
- colcon/colcon-core (primary 2): (c) only, extension registration undocumented.
- chrismatix/grog (primary 2): (c) only.
- meslzy/outdo (primary 3): (c) only.
- Bolt (registry 1): (c) only. Borderline: exit text also says config section documents only `bolt.workspaces`.
- drkns (registry 1): (c) only.
- @enspirit/emb (registry 1): (c) only, built-in plugins without authoring docs.
- workspace-utils (registry 1): (c) only.
- rman (registry 1): (c) only.
- lattice (registry 1): (c) only, extension only by editing source.
- monist / monist-tools (registry 1): (c) only.
- cargo-flux (registry 3): (c) only.
- guild (registry 3): (c) only.
- Watchman (registry 3): (c) only.
- dev-process-manager (registry 3): (c) only. Borderline: notes CLI-to-daemon channel not documented as an interface.
- baton-run (Baton) (registry 3): (c) only.
- clier-ai (clier) (registry 3): (c) only. Borderline: notes Unix socket has no protocol reference.
- fbecart/zinoma (promoted runners): (c) only. Borderline: sample output shows 0.19.0 vs latest 0.19.6, not recorded as confusion.
- Invincible (discovery expansion): (c) only.
- affected, Rani367 (discovery expansion): (c) only. Borderline: (a) is one annotated example, which counted as an (a) gap elsewhere.

## STAYS OUT, flags worth a second look

These stay out under the literal rule, but the other failure is thin or tied to (c).

- Confusion located only in extension or plugin docs: Yarn (hook list missing from plugin tutorial), Vite+ task runner (integration client linked off-site, same fact as its (c) gap), Live Test Runner (custom adapter loading undocumented), pantsbuild/pants (plugin debugging sent to Slack), thought-machine/please (plugin authoring path unclear).
- Plugin-docs confusion plus a separate non-plugin signal: gradle/gradle (also three dependency-declaration entry points), sportradar/elixir-workspace (also ExDoc-only navigation structure signal), BindPort (also "docs site is a work in progress").
- devtooie: otherwise (c) only; the block is one GitHub HTTP 429 abuse-detection response on a blob page, while a later GitHub probe returned 200.
- smorsic/pacwich: its own subsection records (c) only, but the bun-workspaces subsection (registry 1) records confusion on the same pacwich.dev docs.
