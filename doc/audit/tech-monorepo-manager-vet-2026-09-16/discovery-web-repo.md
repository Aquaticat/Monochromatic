# Monorepo manager discovery: web and repository

Run date: 2026-09-16.
Scope: monorepo managers that run arbitrary command tasks across workspace packages,
plus components with a persistent watch or daemon process and an inspection RPC, IPC, or HTTP API.
Excluded categories: templates, bundlers, CI services, libraries.

Screening is discovery-depth only.
A "survivor" passed the category screen from result content;
no hard gate, maintenance check, or source audit was run.
Capability claims marked "recall" were not observed in any result and need verification.

## Query ledger

Provider behavior common to every query:

- Provider: Linkup (`mcp__linkup__linkup-search`); it did not fail, so WebSearch was not used.
- Parameters: `depth: fast`, `maxResults: 20`; no domain, date, or image filters.
- Pagination: Linkup exposes no page or offset parameter.
  To test whether more results existed, W1 to W4 were re-requested with `maxResults: 60`.
  Each returned exactly 20 results;
  for W3 a URL diff against the 20-result call showed 0 new URLs,
  and W1, W2, W4 returned the same URLs in the same order.
  W5 to W8 were not re-requested because the cap was already established.
  The "continue until two consecutive pages add no new survivor" rule therefore could not be applied;
  every query stopped after one page.

### W1

- Query: `monorepo build tool daemon watch mode API inspect running tasks`
- Provider: Linkup, depth fast
- Filters: none
- Pages: 1 (re-request at maxResults 60 returned the same 20)
- Result count: 20
- New candidates: Turborepo, Nx, moon, mise, Lerna, pnpm workspaces, npm workspaces, Yarn workspaces, Task (go-task), Melos,
  devenv, Hermit, Develocity, an unnamed remote execution platform and an unnamed Nix environment manager (tool.news listing),
  `monorepo-watch`, RepoOps, `concurrently`, Bazel (plus Nx MCP server and Bazel MCP server mentions)
- New screening survivors: Turborepo, Nx, moon, Bazel, pnpm workspaces and pipeline, Lerna (weak), Task, Melos (weak)
- Stop reason: provider has no pagination; single capped page

- New candidates: Gradle, pitchfork, `git fsmonitor--daemon`, `dmypy`, systemd, `start-stop-daemon`, moadim, MCPProxy,
  Bubbaloop, Aerospike daemon (moon reappeared with `moon daemon status`)
- New screening survivors: Gradle, pitchfork (component), systemd (component, weak)
- Stop reason: provider has no pagination; single capped page

### W3

- Query: `Bazel alternative monorepo build system 2026`
- Provider: Linkup, depth fast
- Filters: none
- Pages: 1 (re-request at maxResults 60 returned the same 20 URLs, verified by diff)
- Result count: 20
- New candidates: Buck2, Buck (v1), Pants, Mill, Rush, Earthly, Aspect (Aspect Build), BuildBuddy, EngFlow, Gazelle,
  Sapling, Sourcegraph, Aviator, Endor Labs, Railway

- Result count: 20
- New candidates: Apache Druid Tasks API, `doowb/composer`, Watchtower HTTP API, Taskcluster, Kiro, Control Plane Task Runner,
  `bvaughn/task-runner`, Anchor Browser, Browser Use, RunningHub, Nowledge Mem watcher, Apify HTTP Request Runner,

  `inotify-hookable`, `inotifywait` (Gradle reappeared with file system watching and continuous build)
- New screening survivors: none

### Saturation status

- New survivors by query: W1 8, W2 3, W3 6, W4 0, W5 0, W6 0, W7 0, W8 0.
- Per-query page saturation: not testable (provider cap of 20, no paging).
- Schedule-level signal: the last five queries in schedule order added no new survivor,
  but that is ordering evidence, not a two-empty-page stop under the frozen rule.

## Candidates

### Monorepo manager survivors

#### Turborepo

- URL: https://turborepo.dev (also https://turbo.build/repo/docs/reference/watch)
- Discovered by: W1, W3, W4, W5
- Category guess: monorepo manager
- Screening note: survivor.
  Runs `package.json` scripts as tasks across workspace packages with caching.
  Results show `turbo watch` restarting dependent tasks, a "daemon mode for background caching",
  `turbo devtools` that hot-reloads package and task graphs,
  `--dry=json`, `--summarize` run reports,
  and experimental OpenTelemetry run metrics.
  No result showed a documented API for inspecting what a running `turbo watch` is doing.
  Non-JS projects still need a `package.json` wrapper (nx.dev comparison page).
- Taxonomy terms: daemon, watch mode, persistent tasks, devtools, package graph, task graph, dry run JSON,
  run summary, OTLP run metrics, boundaries, remote cache

#### Nx

- URL: https://nx.dev
- Discovered by: W1, W3, W4, W5, W7
- Category guess: monorepo manager
- Screening note: survivor.
  Task runner with caching, affected selection, plugins, and generators;
  results mention an Nx MCP server for agents, `nx graph`, task sandboxing, inferred tasks,
  and `nx sync`, which keeps TypeScript project references synchronized and checks them before `build`, `serve`, or `dev`.
  Nx Cloud is a separate hosted layer and is excluded.
- Taxonomy terms: sync generators (`nx sync`), generators, inferred tasks, project graph, affected, task sandboxing,
  MCP server, agent skills, distributed task execution, self-healing CI

#### moon (moonrepo)

- URL: https://moonrepo.dev (daemon status page https://moonrepo.dev/docs/commands/daemon/status)
- Discovered by: W1, W2, W3, W4, W5
- Category guess: monorepo manager
- Screening note: strongest observed match for the watch plus inspection requirement.
  moon v2 documents `moon daemon status`, which reports PID, a Unix socket or Windows named pipe IPC endpoint,
  uptime, PID file, and log file.
  Whether the IPC protocol is documented for third-party inspection was not observed.
  Polyglot task runner with toolchain management (proto).
- Taxonomy terms: daemon, IPC socket, named pipe, daemon guide, cache inspection, project:task targets, toolchain

#### Bazel

- URL: https://bazel.build
- Discovered by: W1, W3, W4, W5
- Category guess: monorepo manager (hermetic build system)
- Screening note: survivor; already assessed in `doc/research/bazel-migration-dx.md`.
  Results mention a Bazel MCP server with `bazel query`,
  Build Event Protocol output converted to OpenTelemetry traces (EngFlow Munich meetup link),
  and Gazelle BUILD file generation.
- Taxonomy terms: hermetic builds, remote execution, Build Event Protocol (BEP), MCP server, BUILD file generation

#### Buck2

- URL: https://buck2.build
- Discovered by: W3, W4
- Category guess: monorepo manager (hermetic build system)
- Screening note: survivor; results only place it with Bazel and Pants for polyglot hermetic builds.
- Taxonomy terms: hermetic

#### Pants

- URL: https://www.pantsbuild.org
- Discovered by: W3
- Category guess: monorepo manager (build system)
- Screening note: survivor; described as Python-oriented with automatic dependency inference.
- Taxonomy terms: dependency inference

#### Gradle

- URL: https://gradle.org (daemon doc https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_daemon.html)
- Discovered by: W2, W3, W8
- Category guess: monorepo manager (multi-project build system)
- Screening note: survivor; already used in this repository for two Kotlin packages (see R3).
  Long-lived daemon reached over a local socket, `gradle --status` lists daemons as IDLE or BUSY,
  file system watching keeps a virtual file system current between builds,
  and continuous build reruns tasks when declared inputs change.
  `gradle --status` shows daemon state, not per-task activity.
- Taxonomy terms: daemon, local socket, daemon status, continuous build, file system watching, virtual file system (VFS),
  incremental build, up-to-date check, multi-project builds

#### Mill

- URL: https://mill-build.org
- Discovered by: W3 (Sourcegraph list)
- Category guess: monorepo manager (JVM build tool)
- Screening note: survivor; only named in a list recommending it for JVM-heavy teams.

#### Earthly

- URL: https://earthly.dev
- Discovered by: W3 (Sourcegraph list)
- Category guess: monorepo manager (containerized build tool)
- Screening note: survivor pending maintenance check.
  Recall, not observed: Earthly's company announced it was ending Earthly development;
  verify project status before any further work.
- Taxonomy terms: none observed

#### Task (go-task)

- URL: https://taskfile.dev
- Discovered by: W1
- Category guess: monorepo manager (task runner)
- Screening note: survivor; a Python monorepo article uses `Taskfile.yml` includes to build packages in dependency order
  with outputs cached in `.task/`.
- Taxonomy terms: includes, checksum cache

#### pnpm workspaces and pnpm pipeline

- URL: https://pnpm.io
- Discovered by: W1, W3, W4
- Category guess: monorepo manager (package-manager workspace runner)
- Screening note: survivor already under assessment in
  `doc/audit/tech-mpm-and-pnpm-as-a-mise-replacement-vet-2026-09-12.md`; no watch or inspection feature observed.
- Taxonomy terms: recursive run, pipeline

#### Lerna

- URL: https://lerna.js.org
- Discovered by: W1, W3, W4, W7
- Category guess: monorepo manager
- Screening note: weak survivor; results state Lerna v6+ delegates task running and caching to Nx
  and mainly adds versioning and publishing.
- Taxonomy terms: versioning, publishing

#### Melos

- URL: https://melos.invertase.dev
- Discovered by: W1, W7
- Category guess: monorepo manager

  Same author as mise, which matters given the documentation-quality motivation in `doc/planning/mise-removal-coverage.md`.
  No file-watch rebuild behavior observed.
- Taxonomy terms: daemon supervisor, JSON status

#### systemd user units

- URL: https://systemd.io
- Discovered by: W2
- Category guess: component (process supervisor)
- Screening note: weak survivor; `systemctl status` and `systemctl show` expose unit state, logs, and restart policy.
  Linux-only.
  Recall, not observed: `.path` units can trigger services on file changes, and state is also reachable over D-Bus.
- Taxonomy terms: service supervisor, unit status

#### Aspect CLI

- URL: https://aspect.build
- Discovered by: W3
- Category guess: component (Bazel front end)
- Screening note: unverified survivor; results only show Aspect as a Bazel ecosystem company.
  Recall, not observed: Aspect CLI wraps Bazel and adds watch-style workflows.
- Taxonomy terms: none observed

### Screened out

- mise (https://mise.jdx.dev), W1: incumbent that the migration is leaving; monorepo tasks, task templates, task stubs, `mise watch`.

## Repository findings

### R1: candidate ledger in the MPM and pnpm vet report

Source: `doc/audit/tech-mpm-and-pnpm-as-a-mise-replacement-vet-2026-09-12.md`, "Candidate ledger" and "Query outcomes".

- Meta Package Manager 7.6.1 plus pnpm 12.4.1:
  serious alternative with unresolved composition;
  native providers and repository-owned adapters must be named before hard-gate confirmation,
  and stable MPM cannot reproduce several current pins through default restore adapters.
- pnpm 12.4.1 plus repository-owned orchestration and focused native providers:
  serious migration architecture, not a validated candidate stack;
  non-pnpm toolchain, environment, and secret providers unselected;
  watcher process-lifecycle parity under pnpm unverified; no adoption recommendation.
- Mise 2026.9.5 plus pnpm 12.3.4:
  excluded from the requested endpoint; rollback baseline only.
- metapac:
  not promoted; declarative wrapper over package managers that does not answer task, environment, or secret boundaries.
- pacdef:
  hard-gate exit; repository archived 2025-08-05, points to metapac.
- Topgrade:
  category mismatch; upgrades existing installations, not a declarative provisioner or task runner.
- Named in "Query outcomes" but without a ledger entry: `repo-run` and "unrelated task runners" (not individually named).
  The report states its search was not a saturated selection of every task runner.

### R2: candidates and fallbacks in the keep-mise audit and the removal coverage plan

`doc/audit/mise-keep-vs-build-own.md` (2026-06-02):

- mise: kept; no alternative monorepo manager or task runner is named.
- Build our own toolchain and monorepo manager: rejected as disproportionate.
- rustup: named as the provider for a boundary reconcile task, not a replacement candidate.
- No other tool is named as a candidate or fallback.

`doc/planning/mise-removal-coverage.md`:

- Hard requirement fallback order: existing tool on the market, then plug file-enforcer and watch plus RPC into an existing tool,
  then build a Bazel replacement.
- Bazel: assessed as a broader alternative (`doc/research/bazel-migration-dx.md`).
- `@monochromatic-dev/dev-script-file-enforcer`: canonical TypeScript configuration compiler and toolchain-convergence orchestrator.
- pnpm 12.4+ (`pnpm pipeline`, runtimes, Cargo and Python installs, shims): primary surface candidate for tools and tasks.
- Meta Package Manager 7.6.1: serious orchestration candidate for machine packages, not selected.
- Nadle: named fallback, together with "a focused repository task runner", if pnpm cannot preserve task semantics.
- Thin Mise adapters: allowed during migration.
- Watching: "direct watcher processes or a focused task runner", unselected.
- Focused native providers: rustup, Android `sdkmanager`, a verified standalone-binary installer, file-enforcer OS package dispatch.
- Secrets: SOPS and age retained as primitives; child-environment launcher unselected.
- CI: `jdx/mise-action` current owner; replacement blocked on selections.

### R3: tool-name search

Command run as specified; it matched 99 files.
Zero matches for `moonrepo`, `rushjs`, `pantsbuild`, `please.build`, and `process-compose`.
No `turbo.json`, `nx.json`, `moon.yml`, `rush.json`, Bazel, Pants, Taskfile, `process-compose`, Tiltfile, Buck, or Mill configuration exists;
only `package/linter/kotlin/settings.gradle.kts` and `package/music-player/android-app/settings.gradle.kts` matched a config-file search.

- Gradle (67 files): actually used, as a per-package build tool invoked from Mise tasks, not as a monorepo manager.
  Used in `package/linter/kotlin/` (`build.gradle.kts`, `gradlew`, wrapper properties, `mise.toml` publication tasks)
  and `package/music-player/android-app/` (`build.gradle.kts`, `gradlew`, `gradle.properties`, `mise.toml` that shells to the committed wrapper).
  Root `mise.toml` and `mise.no-env.toml` only mention Gradle in JDK and Android SDK comments.
  The remaining matches are documentation: Kotlin and Android decision and vet reports under `doc/decision/`,
  troubleshooting docs such as `doc/troubleshooting/intellij-gradle-kotlin-dsl-symlink.md` and `doc/troubleshooting/kotlin-2-2-10-parallel-gradle-cache.md`,
  `doc/research/bazel-migration-dx.md` (no Gradle interop documented for Bazel), and `README.md`.
  One false positive: `package/cli/forbidden-strings/data/betterleaks-default-config.toml`.
- Turborepo or `turbo` (13 files): mentioned only.
  Real mentions: `doc/audit/file-enforcer.md` (build-graph reconciler tier; registry-present but never surfaced),
  `doc/audit/tech-monorepo-manager-vet-2026-09-16.md` (query schedule), `doc/decision/workspace-ts-source-imports.md` and
  `doc/planning/issue-486-workspace-ts-source-imports.md` (just-in-time internal packages precedent),
  `doc/research/typescript-monorepo-cross-package-imports.md` (docs pinned at a commit), `doc/troubleshooting/oxlint.md`.
  False positives: `gpt-3.5-turbo` and a `turbo` model-speed signal in `package/pi-shared/model-selection/` and `package/pi-plugin/auto-mode/README.md`,
  `libjpeg-turbo` in `package/dev-script/file-enforcer/src/data/packages.generated.ts`, and the betterleaks config.
- Nx (22 files): mentioned only.
  Real mentions: `doc/audit/file-enforcer.md`, `doc/audit/tech-monorepo-manager-vet-2026-09-16.md`,
  `doc/decision/workspace-ts-source-imports.md`, `doc/planning/issue-486-workspace-ts-source-imports.md`,
  `doc/research/typescript-monorepo-cross-package-imports.md` (27 matches), `doc/troubleshooting/oxlint.md`.
  False positives: `\nx` escapes in unit tests, `nx` normal-vector variables (`deps-cube`, `typeface/aquaticat`, `doodle-widget`),
  the `nx-libs` OS package entry, and base64 blobs in HTML files.
- wireit (2 files): mentioned only, in `doc/audit/file-enforcer.md` (build-graph reconciler tier) and the monorepo manager vet report.
- Nadle (2 files): mentioned only, as the fallback in `doc/planning/mise-removal-coverage.md` and in the vet report.
- lage (1 file) and Buck2 (1 file): mentioned only, in `doc/audit/tech-monorepo-manager-vet-2026-09-16.md`.
- Tilt (6 files): one real mention in the vet report;
  the rest are false positives (camera tilt in `deps-cube`, "platform-tilt" in `doc/decision/ios-iphone-x-vet-report/vet-onsen.md`,
  glyph tilt in `package/webapp-productivity/wc/src/favicon.ts`).
- Outside the regex: `doc/audit/file-enforcer.md` also names `moon`, `make`, `ninja`, `redo`, and `tup`
  as registry-absent or build-graph peers of file-enforcer.

### R4: `mise watch` use

178 `mise.toml` files exist under `package/`.

- Active packages invoking `mise watch` (6 files):
  `package/kwin/key-helper/mise.toml`, `package/desktop-daemon/hall-monitor/mise.toml`, `package/ssg/aquati.cat/mise.toml`,
  `package/webapp-productivity/done/mise.toml`, `package/webapp-productivity/done-postcss/mise.toml`, `package/webapp-productivity/rss/mise.toml`.
- Paused packages invoking `mise watch` (5 files):
  `package-paused/webapp-content/messages-demo/mise.toml`, `package-paused/webapp-search/exa-search/mise.toml`,
  `package-paused/dev-script/inference-canary-viewer/mise.toml`, `package-paused/desktop-daemon/editord/mise.toml`,
  `package-paused/webapp-forge/server/mise.toml`.
- Root `mise.toml` and `mise.no-env.toml`: only the comment `# Required by mise watch` above `watchexec = "latest"`.
- Other watch paths in root `mise.toml`: `watch:*` task templates fan out unbounded to package tasks,
  `rolldown --watch`, `tsc --watch`, `node --watch` per test file, and `watch:sync:files` running file-enforcer `--watch`.
- Parallel system: `package/dev-script/watch-restart/` replaces `watchexec` in editord's dev loop
  after documented SIGINT-hang and signal-propagation failures through `watchexec`, `mise`, `sh`, `node`.
- None of these paths exposes an inspection RPC or IPC channel in the lines read.
