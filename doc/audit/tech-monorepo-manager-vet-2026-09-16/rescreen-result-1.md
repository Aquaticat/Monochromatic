# Monorepo manager re-screen, chunk 1

Re-screened 2026-09-16.
Input: `rescreen-chunk-1.json` (11 candidates that earlier exited only on the extension or plugin requirement).
That requirement is withdrawn; G3 was re-run under the remaining rules.

Method:

- Earlier evidence came from `doc/audit/tech-monorepo-manager-vet-2026-09-16/screening-primary-chunk-1.md`, `screening-primary-chunk-2.md`, `screening-primary-chunk-3.md`, and `screening-registry-chunk-1.md`.
  G1 and G2 were not re-decided; one doubt is noted under Bolt.
- Every relied-on page was fetched once with `curl --location --silent --show-error --user-agent 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:130.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/130.0'`, with `--output` and `--write-out '%{http_code} %{url_effective}'` added only to save the body and record status.
  Bot-challenge markers (`cf-challenge`, `challenge-platform`, `captcha`, `Just a moment`, `Attention Required`, `Access denied`, `verify you are human`, `Enable JavaScript and cookies`) were searched outside `<script>` elements; none matched on any page.
  Visible text (scripts, styles, and tags removed) was read for each page, and the docs text was present on every 200 response.
- One github.com page returned 429; per the rate-limiting exception, the same Markdown was read with `gh api repos/<o>/<r>/contents/<path>` (recorded under rman).
- Repository trees, releases, and a docs source clone (`colcon/colcon.readthedocs.org`, shallow) came from `gh`; release dates from `registry.npmjs.org` and PyPI JSON.
- No candidate tool was installed or executed.
- Rule numbers: rule 1 is the confusion cull, rule 2 is no-JS and bot blocking, rule 3 is coverage.
  A rule 1 trigger is an immediate exit; further triggers are listed only as corroboration.

### folke/ultra-runner

- Earlier reason: G3 coverage (c), README-only docs; (a) annotated "partial".
- Release: npm `ultra-runner` 3.10.5 published 2021-02-28 (GitHub release `v3.10.5`, same day).
- Rule 2: https://github.com/folke/ultra-runner returned 200; README text present, no block markers.
- Rule 1 trigger (broken links): in the README sections "⚡ Fast" ("you can configure which scripts should be ran concurrently") and "💫 Getting Started" ("See optional configuration"), both links point to `##gear-optional-configuration` (double `#`).
  The heading anchor is `#gear-optional-configuration` (`id="user-content-gear-optional-configuration"`), so neither link reaches the configuration section.
- Rule 3, also failing:
  - (a) "⚙️ Optional Configuration" is a single annotated `package.json` example (`"ultra": { "concurrent": ["lint"] }`) plus `.ultraignore` prose; no key list or reference.
  - (b) present: `ultra --help` output under "🚀 Usage".
  - (d) to (f) not claimed natively: `--watch` appears only as a flag passed to child build commands, and `--monitor` is a local process list, not IPC.
- Final: exit, G3 rule 1 (broken configuration anchor links); rule 3 (a) also fails.

### colcon/colcon-core

- Earlier reason: G3 coverage (c), extension-point page names extension points without registration or interface; (a) and (b) present.
- Release: no GitHub releases; newest tag `0.21.2` per earlier evidence.
- Rule 2:
  - https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/ returned 200, text present.
  - https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/user/configuration.html returned 200, text present.
  - https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/reference/verb/build.html returned 200, text present.
- Rule 1 trigger (reference incomplete, feature location unknown), on https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/user/configuration.html:
  - The `colcon.pkg` key `type` is described as "to explicitly declare which colcon extension should process the package", with no accepted values.
    A search of every `.rst` file in the docs source (`colcon/colcon.readthedocs.org`) found no page listing package type values.
  - "Using .meta files" says "Some configuration files are being picked up by default. The following are a few examples (see e.g. `colcon build --help`)", so the reference itself is a partial list that defers to CLI help.
- Corroboration: the build verb page renders flag cross-references as `–cmake-target-skip-unavailable` and `–cmake-target clean` (en dash) while the flag heading is `--cmake-target-skip-unavailable`.
- Rule 3: (b) present (build verb page); (d) to (f) not claimed natively.
- Final: exit, G3 rule 1 (configuration reference leaves `type` values undocumented and calls its default-file list "a few examples").

### chrismatix/grog

- Earlier reason: G3 coverage (c), no plugin or extension mechanism; (a) and (b) present.
- Release: GitHub `v0.46.1` published 2026-09-04.
- Rule 2:
  - https://grog.build/ returned 200, text present.
  - https://grog.build/reference/configuration/ returned 200, text present.
  - https://grog.build/reference/commands/ returned 200, text present.
  - https://grog.build/build-configuration/ returned 200, text present.
  - https://grog.build/reference/target-configuration/ returned 200, text present.
- Rule 1 trigger (reference table contradicts field details), on https://grog.build/reference/target-configuration/:
  - The "Fields Reference" table lists `bin_output` with type `Output`, but there is no `bin_output` field detail (no `id="bin_output"` heading, absent from "On this page") and `Output` is not defined on the page.
  - "Field Details" documents `oci_push` (`id="oci_push"`), which the "Fields Reference" table omits.
- Corroboration:
  - https://grog.build/reference/configuration/ offers "a complete example of a grog configuration file", but `skip_workspace_lock`, explained further down the same page, is not in it (one occurrence in the page HTML).
  - https://grog.build/build-configuration/ pins the Pkl package to `package://grog.build/releases/v0.44.0/grog@0.44.0` while the latest release is `v0.46.1`.
- Rule 3: (a) and (b) otherwise present; (d) to (f) not claimed.
- Final: exit, G3 rule 1 (target configuration table and field details disagree).

### meslzy/outdo

- Earlier reason: G3 coverage, no extension or plugin mechanism ("no plugin ecosystem"); (a), (b), and (d) watch documented.
- Release: npm `@meslzy/outdo` 0.0.1 published 2026-08-26.
- Rule 2:
  - https://meslzy.github.io/outdo/ returned 200, text present.
  - https://meslzy.github.io/outdo/reference/task-api returned 200, text present.
  - https://meslzy.github.io/outdo/reference/cli returned 200, text present.
  - https://meslzy.github.io/outdo/guide/watch-and-services returned 200, text present.
- Rule 1 trigger (prose contradicts examples and registry), on https://meslzy.github.io/outdo/reference/task-api:
  - The page says "Everything in outdo's public surface is exported from "outdo"", but its own example imports `defineTasks` and `task` from `"@meslzy/outdo"`, as does the home page example.
  - `https://registry.npmjs.org/outdo` returns 404; the published package is `@meslzy/outdo`.
    The home page quick start `bunx outdo init` names the unscoped package that does not exist.
- Corroboration: the same page, introduced as "Everything do.ts can export, in one place", truncates its type list with "…".
- Final: exit, G3 rule 1 (package specifier contradiction between prose, examples, and registry).

### Bolt

- Earlier reason: G3 coverage (c), README-only docs with no extension documentation; configuration documents only `bolt.workspaces`; several commands marked not implemented.
- Release: npm `bolt` 0.24.10 published 2021-09-28; repository last push 2024-06-01; not archived.
- Rule 2: https://github.com/boltpkg/bolt returned 200, README text present.
  `gh api repos/boltpkg/bolt/contents/` shows no docs directory, so the README is the only doc.
- Rule 1 triggers:
  - Undefined status marker: the "Commands" table marks commands ✅, ❌, or 🖌; 🖌 (on `bolt build`, `bolt test`, `bolt format/fmt`, `bolt lint`, `bolt doc`, `bolt check`) is never explained, so whether those commands exist cannot be read from the docs.
  - Obsolete docs: "But Bolt (will soon) do lots of other stuff ... Well that's what Bolt will do for you (once we get around to implementing it)", with the last release in 2021.
- Rule 3 (a) also fails: "Configuration" is one example ("For examples, for declaring workspaces in sub-directories") of `bolt.workspaces`.
- G1 doubt, not re-decided: the README says `bolt ws run [script]` runs "a script in every package" and documents no dependency ordering.
- Final: exit, G3 rule 1 (undefined command status marker; obsolete roadmap text); rule 3 (a) also fails.

### drkns

- Earlier reason: G3 coverage (c); README has `drkns.yml` fields (a) and a command list (b).
- Release: PyPI `drkns` 4.0.0 uploaded 2026-08-25.
- Rule 2: https://github.com/frantzmiccoli/drkns returned 200, README text present.
- Rule 1 trigger (config keys only in test fixtures): README "Steps" says a step can "Have a command to run, string, required" and "Have a background flag", without naming the keys.
  The keys `command:` and `background: true` appear only in the test fixture `testprojects/nominalcase/project3/drkns.yml`, and the README sends readers to "a dummy project on which our tests are based".
- Corroboration:
  - "Troubleshooting" runs `drkns sync forget dir1_project2/fedd32a-adbcc445555`, while "drkns CLI > Commands" documents `drkns forget UNIT_NAME[/HASH]` and `drkns sync DIRECTION` with DIRECTION `in` or `out`.
  - "In your CI" comments `drkns sync out --delete` as "Persist all execution statuses from S3".
- Final: exit, G3 rule 1 (step keys learnable only from test fixtures; `forget` command spelled two ways).

### @enspirit/emb

- Earlier reason: G3 coverage, configuration reference documents only built-in plugins.
- Release: npm `@enspirit/emb` 0.31.1 published 2026-08-17.
- Rule 2:
  - https://enspirit.github.io/emb/ returned 200, text present.
  - https://enspirit.github.io/emb/getting-started/introduction/ returned 200, text present.
  - https://enspirit.github.io/emb/reference/configuration/ returned 200, text present.
  - https://enspirit.github.io/emb/reference/cli/ returned 200, text present.
- Rule 1 trigger (self-described complete reference contradicts itself), on https://enspirit.github.io/emb/reference/configuration/, which says "This is the complete reference for EMB configuration files":
  - "Variable Expansion > Syntax" lists only the `${env:...}`, `${vars:...}`, and `${vault:...}` forms, while the same page documents `${op:...}` expansion under `plugins` and uses `${op:Private/db-credentials#connection_string}` in the `file` resource example.
  - "Rebuild triggers" names `flavors.<flavor>.defaults.rebuildPolicy['docker/image']`, but both `flavors` sections (project and component) document only `patches`.
- Corroboration: https://enspirit.github.io/emb/reference/cli/ ("Complete reference for all EMB commands") states "`emb <command> --help` is always authoritative".
- Final: exit, G3 rule 1 (configuration reference omits keys and syntax it uses on the same page).

### workspace-utils

- Earlier reason: G3 coverage (c), no plugin, extension, or hook mechanism.
- Release: npm `workspace-utils` 2.1.2 published 2026-08-21.
- Rule 2:
  - https://torstendittmann.github.io/workspace-utils/ returned 200, text present.
  - https://torstendittmann.github.io/workspace-utils/configuration/ returned 200, text present.
  - https://torstendittmann.github.io/workspace-utils/commands/overview/ returned 200, text present.
  - https://torstendittmann.github.io/workspace-utils/commands/run/ returned 200, text present.
  - https://torstendittmann.github.io/workspace-utils/commands/build/ returned 200, text present.
- Rule 1 trigger (broken links): the configuration page's "Next Steps" links `./concepts/workspace-detection.md`, `./concepts/package-managers.md`, and `./advanced/performance.md`.
  The first resolves to https://torstendittmann.github.io/workspace-utils/configuration/concepts/workspace-detection.md, which returned 404; `docs/src` in the repository has no `concepts` or `advanced` directory.
- Corroboration:
  - The configuration page example `"typecheck": "workspace-utils run typecheck --parallel"` uses `--parallel`, which none of the configuration, commands overview, run, or build pages document (only `--sequential`).
  - The configuration page calls `--filter` a "Repeatable relationship-aware package selector" (`--filter "app..."`), while the run page says "Filter packages by glob pattern" and the configuration page's "Multiple Filters" says "Use multiple invocations".
- Final: exit, G3 rule 1 (404 links from the configuration page; undocumented flag in its example).

### rman

- Earlier reason: G3 coverage (c), CLI and programmatic API documented; only pre/post script hooks.
- Release: npm `rman` 1.0.12 published 2026-09-16.
- Rule 2:
  - https://github.com/panates/rman returned 200, README text present.
  - https://github.com/panates/rman/blob/main/docs/cli.md returned 200, text present.
  - https://github.com/panates/rman/blob/main/docs/cli/run.md returned 200, text present.
  - https://github.com/panates/rman/blob/main/docs/api.md returned 429 (GitHub rate limiting of our request volume, not a project bot wall); the same Markdown was read with `gh api repos/panates/rman/contents/docs/api.md`.
- Rule 1 trigger (contradiction between summary and reference):
  - README "Commands" table: `publish` "Publishes every package to its configured target(s) - npm, Docker and/or GitHub Releases".
  - README section `rman github-release`: "It is deliberately neither a publish.target nor opt-in".
  - `docs/api.md` "Config keys reference", row `publish.target`: `'npm' | 'docker'`, "The repository's GitHub Release is not a target here".
  - The README "Commands" table also omits `github-release`, which the README documents further down.
- Corroboration: in `docs/api.md`, the `run.<script>.concurrency` row says "See `RunService` below", but the `RunService` section never explains `concurrency` (its `Options` type has `parallel`), and its per-script YAML example declares `test:` twice.
  The raw file's header comment records `package-version: 1.0.11`, one release behind npm (not visible in rendered view).
- Final: exit, G3 rule 1 (README says GitHub Releases is a publish target; README section and config reference say it is not).

### lattice (@latticeandcompany/lattice)

- Earlier reason: G3 coverage (c), extension only by editing source; CLI and configuration references exist.
- Release: GitHub `v1.1.1` published 2026-09-10; npm `@latticeandcompany/lattice` 1.1.1 same day.
- Rule 2:
  - https://latticeandcompany.github.io/lattice returned 200 (redirected to `/lattice/`), text present.
  - https://latticeandcompany.github.io/lattice/docs returned 200 (redirected to `/docs/`), text present.
  - https://latticeandcompany.github.io/lattice/docs/configuration returned 200, text present.
  - https://latticeandcompany.github.io/lattice/docs/cli returned 200, text present.
  - https://latticeandcompany.github.io/lattice/docs/nested-repos returned 200, text present.
  - https://latticeandcompany.github.io/lattice/docs/dev-servers returned 200, text present.
- Rule 1 trigger (contradiction between pages): https://latticeandcompany.github.io/lattice/docs/ says "Nested repos covers a repo that contains another repo with its own `lattice.json`".
  The linked page, https://latticeandcompany.github.io/lattice/docs/nested-repos, is titled "Wrap a repo that has its own task runner" and wraps a turbo subtree; its only `lattice.json` is the root one (one occurrence on the page), and the repository example `examples/nested-repo` has a single root `lattice.json` with `frontend/turbo.json`.
  The configuration page says commands walk up "to the nearest lattice.json", so an inner `lattice.json` has behavior, but the page the introduction promises for it does not cover it.
- Context for the caller: this was the only trigger found; the configuration and CLI references read consistently otherwise.
- Rule 3 otherwise: (a) https://latticeandcompany.github.io/lattice/docs/configuration and (b) https://latticeandcompany.github.io/lattice/docs/cli are field-level and flag-level references; (d) to (f) not claimed natively (dev servers are `persistent: true` tasks; the dev servers example uses `cargo watch` as a user command).
- Final: exit, G3 rule 1 (introduction misdescribes the nested repos page).

### monist / monist-tools

- Earlier reason: G3 coverage (c), README documents `monistrc.json` and commands; README says Monist is being phased out.
- Release: npm `monist` 1.7.0 published 2020-02-10; npm `monist-tools` 2.0.0 published 2021-11-06.
- Rule 2:
  - https://github.com/lddubeau/monist returned 200, README text present.
  - https://github.com/lddubeau/monist-tools returned 200, README text present.
- Rule 1 trigger (obsolete docs): the monist README opens "IMPORTANT NOTE: Monist is being phased out in favor of npm workspaces".
- Corroboration:
  - "Issues With Parallelism" refers to `monist run-all some-script`, a command absent from "Usage" (`npm`, `run`, `update-versions`, `set-script`, `verify-deps`).
  - `--local-deps=link` says "Monist 2 will remove this option", but npm `monist` has no 2.x version; the forked `monist-tools` started at 2.0.0 and dropped `run`, so whether it is "Monist 2" is not stated.
  - "Usage" gives one-line summaries and says "Please use monist [cmd] --help to get a more comprehensive description", deferring the CLI reference (rule 3 (b)) to the binary.
  - monist-tools: its README lists only `update-versions`, `set-script`, and `verify-deps` (no task running, so it does not fit G1 alone) and says "You invoke monist with monist" while its commands are `monist-tools ...`.
- Final: exit, G3 rule 1 (docs declare the tool phased out).

## Survivors

None.
All 11 candidates exit at G3 rule 1; none reached G4.
Rule 2 blocked no candidate (one github.com 429 was handled by the rate-limit exception).
