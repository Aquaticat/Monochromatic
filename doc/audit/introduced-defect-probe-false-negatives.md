# The introduced-defect probe misses the damage that actually ships

Measured 2026-08-20 from settled artifacts alone.
Zero quota, and NO HUMAN GRADING, which is the point of the exercise:
`#66` had been recorded as waiting on graded regions,
and it did not need them.

## The ground truth was already in hand

Two pieces of damage were established earlier by reading shipped output,
not by grading a sheet:

-   `lintong` ships a farewell that offers the same thing twice,
    counted as two occurrences of each of two distinguishing noun phrases
    against one occurrence in the translate lane
-   `saurikissa` slice 7 ships a sentence severed after its preposition,
    spliced onto an unrelated independent clause

Both are damage the repair lane introduced.
Both are exactly what an introduced-defect probe exists to catch.

## What the probe said about them

```text
saurikissa chunk 7    probe records 3   regions 3   all three probers found nothing   claims 0
saurikissa chunk 8    probe records 2   regions 2   all three probers found nothing   claims 0
saurikissa chunk 9    probe records 4   regions 4   all three probers found nothing   claims 0
```

The full roster was heard on every one of them,
so this is not a quiet stage or a lost voice:
three probers looked at the region and each reported nothing.

Across the whole flagged pool:

```text
entry            probe records   regions   regions with any claim   all probers found nothing
lintong                     27        27                        3                         24
saurikissa                  27        28                        3                         25
GLaDOSister                 49        50                        3                         47
dogesir_                    42        42                       10                         32
wangzihao980                18        18                        0                         18
```

The probe is not silent in general, which matters:
it raised 3 corroborated claims on `lintong` and 10 claim-bearing regions on `dogesir_`.
It simply did not raise either of the two defects that reached the finished documents.

## The two misses have different causes, and only one is fixable at the probe

`saurikissa` SLICE 7 IS AN IN-SCOPE FALSE NEGATIVE.
The slice was edited, its regions were probed, the full roster answered,
and a sentence severed mid-clause is precisely a within-region defect.
Three probers reading a region containing a broken sentence reported nothing wrong with it.

`lintong` IS OUT OF SCOPE BY CONSTRUCTION, and this is the more important half.
The probe compares a region before and after the edit that touched it.
The duplication is not inside any one region:
slice 3's edit legitimately kept wording it was not asked to remove,
slice 2's edit legitimately wrote a new rendering,
and the damage is that the assembled document now says the same thing twice.
Every region is defensible on its own.
No region-scoped instrument can see it,
however many probers vote and however well they read.

## Why this matters more than a rate

`#57` built this probe as telemetry and `#60` measured its FALSE POSITIVES.
Neither asked the question this answers:
of the damage that actually reached a finished document,
how much did the probe name.
On the two cases where damage is established, the answer is none.

THE SCOPE FINDING IS THE SAME ROOT CAUSE AS `#107`.
A per-slice pipeline gets per-slice instruments,
and both go blind to anything that crosses a boundary.
`#107` widened what the critic, panel and editor are SHOWN.
The probe was not widened with them,
so the pipeline can now discuss a relocation while its damage instrument still cannot see one.

## What follows, in order

1.  The probe's window should match the stages it audits.
    It is handed regions; it should be handed the neighbouring slices' shipped text too,
    for the same measured reason `#107` gives, and with the same one-section bound.
2.  A DOCUMENT-SCALE repetition check belongs beside it rather than inside it.
    The `lintong` case is detectable with no model at all
    once the whole assembled document is in view,
    and `window-gates.mjs` already does exactly that by deriving repeated phrases.
    That derivation is the prototype; it wants to become a stage.
3.  Only then is a false-negative RATE worth computing,
    because a rate over an instrument with a known blind spot measures the blind spot.

## What this does not claim

TWO CASES ARE TWO CASES.
This is a floor on the false-negative rate rather than an estimate of it,
and the pool is five hand-picked entries that may serve this comparison only.
What it establishes is that the probe misses damage that ships,
and that one of the two misses is structural rather than a matter of tuning.

## The document-scale check is built, and it catches the case that shipped

`findIntroducedRepetitions` in `src/assembly-repetition.ts`, landed 2026-08-20.
No model, no roster, no quota.
A phrase the archive says once and the shipped document says twice is a repetition this
pipeline added, which is a fact about two strings.

Run over the five settled artifacts, taking the archive from the comparison rows'
`incumbentText` since these predate the stored archive field:

```text
entry            lane        introduced repetitions
lintong          repair                           3     longest 6 words, archive 1, shipped 2
lintong          translate                        0
saurikissa       repair                           0
saurikissa       translate                        1     4 words, archive 1, shipped 2
GLaDOSister      repair                           0
GLaDOSister      translate                        0
dogesir_         repair                           0
dogesir_         translate                        1     5 words, archive 0, shipped 2
wangzihao980     repair                           0
wangzihao980     translate                        0
```

IT REPRODUCES THE KNOWN CASE AND THE KNOWN LANE SPLIT. `lintong`'s repair lane is the
document that ships the duplicated farewell, and its translate lane is the one that does not.
That split was found by reading the finished text; the check now derives it from the
artifacts without being told what to look for.

TWO FINDINGS NOBODY HAD, both in the translate lane, which had not been suspected of this at
all. `dogesir_`'s is the more interesting shape: the archive never carried the wording and
the shipped document says it twice, so the lane invented a passage and then said it again.

`saurikissa`'s REPAIR lane reads zero, correctly. Its defect is a severed sentence rather
than a repetition, so this check is silent on it by design, and that remains the in-scope
false negative belonging to the probe.

### What is still owed

The check is a function with tests, not yet a stage. Nothing calls it during a run, so it
reports on artifacts after the fact rather than putting a finding in one. Wiring it into the
document driver, beside the existing assembly guards, is the remaining step, and it is cheap
because it needs nothing from the network.
