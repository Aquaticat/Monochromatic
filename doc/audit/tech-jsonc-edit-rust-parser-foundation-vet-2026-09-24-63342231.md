# Vet the parser foundation for a native Rust jsonc-edit

## Status and fingerprint

- Status: Discovery and targeted source screening, incomplete. No candidate is recommended or adopted.
- Subject: jsonc-edit Rust parser foundation.
- Scope: Choose a parser and token source for the published native Rust comment-as-data JSONC editor.
- Started and last updated: 2026-09-24.
- Owner: current coding-agent session.
- Governing skill: `.agents/skills/choosing-technology/SKILL.md` at `a05818ad7`, SHA-256 `393eb68c5b2b2f7b16c8f7f90c100fb8be43eefa4501511360cd0572e4ae8087`.
- Fingerprint, RFC 8785 canonicalized schema version 1: `63342231cc8d34fcdb2effc92f9c276181ddde482f704a397f3eb0b25fe8cf26`.
- No compatible prior parser-foundation report was found by a `rg --files doc/audit` search for JSONC or Rust parser.
- Category: inspectable open-source local technology, including a repository-owned translation as baseline. Overlays: native, multi-platform and untrusted parsing input. No browser, credential, or CI-execution overlay for the library itself. The maintained TypeScript library is a behavior reference, not removed.
- Hard constraints: strict JSONC-only container roots, original numeric and quoted-string lexemes, escaped unpaired UTF-16 surrogate support, separately queryable normalized comments on keys and values after adaptation, inspectable source and reproducible validation, compatible licensing, and no regex-backed production parsing or lexing in required dependencies.
- Deployment: native Rust crate on Linux, macOS and Windows, crates.io release.
- Criteria, frozen before candidate rating with default weight 1 each: source auditability, API clarity for the comment model, dependency and build surface, maintenance evidence, and measured parse performance. Ratings and sensitivity remain pending.

## Discovery schedule and limits

The delegated research froze its literal initial queries before discovery:

- In-repo: `rg --files doc package | rg 'rust-structured-edits|jsonc|json-five|biome_json|edikt'` and `rg --line-number 'jsonc-parser|edikt-jsonc|json-five|biome_json_parser|attached.comment|surrogate' doc package`.
- Registry/web: `site:crates.io/crates/ jsonc-parser edikt-jsonc json-five biome_json_parser latest version repository` and `Rust JSONC parser lossless comments tokens raw string escapes exact numeric literals crates source` via Exa fast/Linkup fallback.
- Repository host: targeted official source linked from crates and repository decision records; broad GitHub query and registry pagination remain to be run. One de-duplicated expansion round must be frozen and recorded from taxonomy terms before further discovery.

Both local delegated `rg` queries were blocked by its security guardrail, so targeted reads were used instead. No class is saturated; counts and page cursors are still needed. The browser/page source findings here are leads, not hard-gate confirmations until pinned repository source is read and behavior probed.

## Candidate ledger

### Repository-owned parser translation

- Discovery: `package/module/jsonc-edit/src/parse.ts`, `src/scan.ts`, `src/parse-trivia.ts` and accepted `doc/decision/jsonc-edit-parser-foundation.md`.
- Category: inspectable repository-owned implementation, native and multi-platform overlays.
- Screening: plausible semantic fit. Rust UTF-16 values and exact numeric model differ from TypeScript, so direct translation needs design and verification; not automatically recommended.

### `jsonc-parser` 0.33.2

- Discovery: [versioned source and API](https://docs.rs/jsonc-parser/0.33.2/jsonc_parser/) and prior in-repo [Rust edit survey](../planning/monorepo-manager-route-research/rust-structured-edits.md).
- Category: inspectable open-source Rust parser with native and multi-platform overlays.
- Screening: source at private clone `~/temp/agent/jsonc-parser-2026-09-16`, revision `e6e3837`, `src/scanner.rs:175-201` decodes escaped strings during scanning; `src/string.rs:214-261` rejects unpaired high and low surrogates. It cannot parse the required accepted string domain as-is. An upstream fork modifying its string scanner would be a distinct custom candidate. It exposes comments and raw number tokens, but normalized key/value attachment and canonical emission would still be repository code.

### `edikt-jsonc` 0.4.0

- Discovery: [crates.io entry](https://crates.io/crates/edikt-jsonc) and [lexer source](https://docs.rs/crate/edikt-jsonc/0.4.0/source/src/lexer.rs).
- Category: inspectable open-source Rust lexer/CST with native and multi-platform overlays.
- Screening: raw comments, strings, and numbers are available. [Comment projection](https://docs.rs/crate/edikt-jsonc/0.4.0/source/src/comments.rs) puts key-side and value-side comments together on the value, so an attachment layer is still needed. [Value projection](https://docs.rs/crate/edikt-jsonc/0.4.0/source/src/project.rs) uses `f64` for some numbers and Rust `String`; bypassing it may allow a compliant projection from raw tokens. JSON5 and malformed-input acceptance requires strict validation. Pin clone and probe before any conclusion.

### `json-five` 0.3.1

- Discovery: [round-trip token source](https://docs.rs/crate/json-five/0.3.1/source/src/rt/tokenize.rs) and [parser source](https://docs.rs/crate/json-five/0.3.1/source/src/rt/parser.rs).
- Category: inspectable open-source Rust parser with native and multi-platform overlays.
- Screening: raw scalar text and comment-bearing whitespace contexts may support an adapter, but JSON5 grammar and scalar roots need strict validation. The prior in-repo survey records a malformed block-comment emission; the canonical emitter in this port may avoid that path. UTF-16 behavior not yet verified.

### `biome_json_parser` 0.5.7

- Discovery: [lexer source](https://docs.rs/crate/biome_json_parser/0.5.7/source/src/lexer/mod.rs) and [parser source](https://docs.rs/crate/biome_json_parser/0.5.7/source/src/lib.rs).
- Category: inspectable open-source Rust parser with native and multi-platform overlays.
- Screening: lossless trivia and raw scalar ranges may support an adapter. [Prior repository research](../planning/monorepo-manager-route-research/rust-structured-edits.md) corrected its build pin count to three exact companion crates. Strict container-root validation and the attached-comment layer remain repository work. Token support for unpaired escapes must be probed.

### `jwc` 0.1.0

- Discovery: [AST source](https://docs.rs/crate/jwc/0.1.0/source/src/ast.rs) and [parser source](https://docs.rs/crate/jwc/0.1.0/source/src/single_pass_parser.rs).
- Category: inspectable open-source Rust parser with native and multi-platform overlays.
- Screening: key and value trivia are distinguished, but its parser rejects unpaired surrogate escapes according to source in the delegated research. It cannot parse the required domain as-is. Numeric values use approximate `f64` beyond bounded integers, so an exact adapter would also be needed.

## Current source checks, not a recommendation

- `jsonc-parser` 0.33.2, private clone `~/temp/agent/jsonc-parser-2026-09-24` at `e6e3837` (`Cargo.toml:3` names the version): `src/scanner.rs:175-201` calls the string decoder for escaped tokens, and `src/string.rs:214-261` explicitly returns `InvalidUnicodeEscapeSequence` for an unpaired high or low surrogate. The existing crate cannot parse `{"s":"\uD800"}` in its required JSONC grammar. Using its scanner would require an upstream fork, which is a distinct custom candidate.

  ```rust
  // src/scanner.rs:199-201
  crate::string::parse_string_with_char_provider(self)
    .map(Token::String)
    .map_err(|err| self.create_error_for_start(err.byte_index, ParseErrorKind::String(err.kind)))
  ```

- `edikt-jsonc` 0.4.0, private clone `~/temp/agent/edikt-2026-09-24` at `c87295c` (`crates/edikt-jsonc/Cargo.toml:3`): its `project.rs:122-131` converts a large integer to `f64`, and its `project.rs:140-185` unescapes `\u` via `char::from_u32`. An unpaired surrogate has no Rust `char` and falls through without appending a code unit. A compliant adapter must bypass that projection, read raw lexer tokens, decode to UTF-16, and implement the library's own comment attachment. `crates/edikt-jsonc/Cargo.toml:9-15` lists `edikt-core`, `edikt-syntax`, `logos`, `rowan` and `thiserror` as direct dependencies. License, CI, tests and full transitive tree remain to be checked.

  ```rust
  // crates/edikt-jsonc/src/project.rs:172-175
  let hex: String = chars.by_ref().take(4).collect();
  if let Some(ch) = u32::from_str_radix(&hex, 16).ok().and_then(char::from_u32) {
      out.push(ch);
  }
  ```

- `json-five` 0.3.1, private clone `~/temp/agent/json-five-rs-2026-09-24` at `650be6a` (`Cargo.toml:3`): `src/rt/parser.rs:94-145` stores number and quoted-string lexemes verbatim; `src/rt/parser.rs:21` calls whitespace/comment context `Wsc = String`. It needs strict JSONC validation and a separate attached-comment parser and canonical emitter. Its `Cargo.toml:14-24` lists `unicode-general-category` and optional `serde` as production dependencies. Unpaired-surrogate acceptance in the round-trip parser remains to be probed.

`edikt-jsonc` and `json-five` remain serious composed candidates, not validated finalists. The repository-owned parser translation remains a baseline. `biome_json_parser` and other discovered candidates remain unscreened against the exact surrogate and comment boundary; no elimination or ranking is justified yet.

## Parser expansion findings and registry pages

The frozen expansion searched crates.io using `jsonc comments` and `lossless json parser`.
For the first query, page 1 and page 2 each returned 100 records, and page 3 was empty (page 2 metadata reported total 200).
For the second, pages 1 and 2 each returned 100, and page 3 returned 86 with no next page (total 286).
These registry queries are exhausted, not evidence that every library is viable or that the broader discovery is complete.
The two frozen `gh search repos` queries returned no records; broaden to comparable linked upstream repositories before calling the repository-host class saturated.
Web searches discovered `jwc`, `hifijson`, `fjson`, `tokora`, and lexer-only `any-lexer` as leads; most lack evidence of the attached JSONC comment model.

### `fjson` 0.3.1

- Discovery: crates.io `jsonc comments` page 1, [registry](https://crates.io/crates/fjson/0.3.1), private clone `~/temp/agent/fjson-2026-09-24` at `fe5a04a`, `Cargo.toml:3` confirms 0.3.1 and `:13-15` names `arrayvec` and `unicode-width` as runtime dependencies.
- Screening: `src/scanner.rs:142-181,186-215,223-271` returns raw JSON numbers, quoted strings (without outer quotes) and C-style comments. Its `src/ast.rs:12-60` holds same-line value comments but keeps most comments as separate `Metadata` objects, not distinct key/value comment fields. An attachment and merge layer, UTF-16 decoder and canonical writer are still needed. `src/ast.rs:64,83` caps parser recursion at 128 levels, while the TypeScript structured parser allows 512 (`package/module/jsonc-edit/src/parse.ts:21,54`). Its scanner also skips Unicode whitespace outside strings (`src/scanner.rs:335-339`), whereas strict JSONC uses JSON whitespace. These are source observations, not a completed upstream-behavior diagnosis or a validated workaround.

  ```rust
  // src/scanner.rs:335-339
  fn skip_whitespace(&mut self) {
      while let Some(c) = self.peek_char() {
          if c.1.is_whitespace() && c.1 != '\n' {
              self.skip_char();
  ```

- Source quality lead: `src/lib.rs:151` forbids unsafe code. `.github/workflows/test.yml` runs Cargo fmt, build, clippy and test, with no build script in this crate's manifest; transitive command trees are not yet audited. This is a serious lexer/AST candidate, not a finalist.

### Other registry leads

- `jsonc` 0.1.0 has no repository URL in registry metadata; the published source in the local Cargo cache (`jsonc_document.rs:2-4,62-73,107-119`) wraps `jsonc-parser` and projects through `serde_json::Value`. It inherits the upstream scanner's surrogate constraint and cannot provide the full contract as-is.
- `jsonc_tools` 0.0.1 published source (`src/lib.rs:1-18`, `src/parser/parser.rs:1-13`) is a scaffold with no JSONC parser implementation. Category mismatch.
- `jsontape`, `hifijson`, `tokora`, `purrdf-json`, and `momoa` remain discovery leads requiring category screening; none is yet recommended or rejected on registry description alone.

## Regex screening, 2026-09-24

The user explicitly excludes production regex. The original TypeScript scanner in `package/module/jsonc-edit/src/scan.ts` uses direct character scans. `edikt-jsonc` 0.4.0 is now **excluded**: `crates/edikt-jsonc/src/lexer.rs:47-69` uses repeated `#[regex(...)]` patterns through `logos::Logos` (`:23`), not merely a dev-only regex dependency. See [versioned lexer source](https://docs.rs/crate/edikt-jsonc/0.4.0/source/src/lexer.rs). Stop its audit at this hard gate.

`json-five` 0.3.1 lists `regex = "1"` only under `[dev-dependencies]` in `Cargo.toml:30-32`; its inspected production `src/` has no `regex::`, `Regex::`, `#[regex]`, or `logos` use. Do not cull on test-only dependencies. Direct source/manifests for `fjson`, `jsonc-parser`, `biome_json_parser`, `jwc`, and `hifijson` yielded no matching regex calls or macros under the same targeted search, but their required transitive production paths still need audit. This is **pending**, not a claim of global absence.

## Evidence and validation still required

- Finish the scheduled registry, repository-host and broader-web discovery with pagination saturation and an expansion round. Log every query, filters, result counts and newly discovered survivor.
- Clone every serious alternative under private `~/temp/agent/`, pin release revision, inspect licenses, manifests, source, tests/CI and maintenance. The delegated research read remote sources and did not execute code; its findings are not final validation.
- Audit relevant parser and serializer paths for original scalar tokens, comments, escaped unpaired surrogates, strict JSONC, resource bounds and errors. Compare a repository-owned parser with any third-party raw-token adapter at equal depth.
- Inspect every third-party execution tree and isolate any build/test/probe before running it. Exercise the TypeScript conformance corpus, comment queries, malformed cases, exact numbers and surrogates from a disposable Rust consumer.
- Rate validated finalists with the frozen rubric, run sensitivity and publish a full ranking with pros, cons and adjacent reasons. Present the result for separate adoption. No product dependency, decision record, or release change before adoption.
