# Every volume guard is blind to one model, and the straggler window is all that stops it

Measured 2026-08-25 against the live full-roster editor calibration
(`editor-calibrate.mjs 40`, 15 of 40 slices, 3 hours 44 minutes elapsed, zero `[error]` lines).
Read from the run log alone.
No corpus wording appears here: model ids, counts and durations only.

## What was measured

Every model was asked exactly 120 times, so the denominators need no adjustment.
Streams that completed, plus voices abandoned, per model:

-   `minimax-m3`: 120 completed, 0 abandoned.
-   `hf:openai/gpt-oss-120b`: 120 completed, 0 abandoned.
-   `hf:nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-NVFP4`: 120 completed, 0 abandoned.
-   `hf:moonshotai/Kimi-K3`: 120 completed, 0 abandoned.
-   `deepseek-v4-pro-0813`: 120 completed, 0 abandoned.
-   `deepseek-v4-flash-0731`: 120 completed, 0 abandoned.
-   `gemma-4-26b-a4b-it`: 120 completed, 0 abandoned, 4 schema mismatches.
-   `hf:Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B`: 118 completed, 2 abandoned, 1.7 percent.
-   `hf:zai-org/GLM-5.2`: 109 completed, 11 abandoned, 9.2 percent.
-   `qwen3.8-max`: 98 completed, 21 abandoned, 17.6 percent.

Seven of ten seats lose no voice at all.
The loss is 34 voices, and 21 of them are one model.

## The finding

`qwen3.8-max` reports content characters of 0 at the median AND at the 95th percentile,
across all 100 of its completed streams in this run.
Not one byte it has sent in this run was accounted to the content channel.
Its 34,202 character maximum is entirely reasoning.

Every other seat reports content between 303 and 619 characters at the median.

This is `#211` at production scale.
`#211` was proved on a single captured frame sequence: the provider emits two `content_block_start`
frames for the same block index, the second declaring `thinking`, so the `input_json_delta` frames
carrying the tool-call arguments are routed to `reasoning` by `channelFor` in
`src/anthropic-delta-scan.ts`.
`qwen3.8-max` is the one seat on `toolChoice: 'auto'`, so its whole answer arrives as
`input_json_delta`, so its whole answer is filed as reasoning.

## Why that is worse than a telemetry error

`src/stream-runaway-watch.ts` applies its volume cap to the content channel only:

```ts
// src/stream-runaway-watch.ts
const contentChars = ratioDetectors.content
  .charsSeen();
if (contentChars >= contentCap)
  return {
    kind: 'overrun',
    channel: 'content',
    charsSeen: contentChars,
    cap: contentCap,
  };
```

The module note beside it states the intent plainly, that the reasoning channel is untouched.
`#156` measured the answer bound at 32000 and declined a reasoning bound deliberately.
`maxAnswerChars` reaches this cap as `contentCap` through `drainBody` in `src/stream-drain.ts`,
and `producedVolumeBound` scales it per call for the translate lane.

So for `qwen3.8-max` the chain is:
its answer is filed as reasoning,
the volume cap reads content,
content remains zero,
and no volume guard can ever fire on it.
The ratio and recurrence detectors still watch reasoning,
but they did not fire on any of the 21 cuts.

The only thing that stops this model is `STRAGGLER_GRACE_MS`.
That is what the 21 cuts are.

## What the cuts look like

The abandoned voices were cut mid-reply having delivered, per model:

-   `qwen3.8-max`: 106,405 characters once, then 19 of 21 clustered between 293,163 and 350,293.
-   `hf:zai-org/GLM-5.2`: 248,535 to 3,020,068.
-   `hf:Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B`: 656,600 and 1,276,871.

The `qwen3.8-max` cluster is tight because the cut is time-bound rather than volume-bound:
at a steady stream rate, 180 seconds buys a roughly constant number of characters.

## The decision this refutes

`doc/decision/translation-repair-straggler-grace.md`, taken 2026-08-17, moved the window from 60 to
180 seconds. Its central claim:

> NOT ONE HUNG CALL WAS RECORDED. The window exists to stop a model that answers nothing from
> delaying the pipeline, and in 602 exchanges it has never once met that model. Every voice it has
> taken was a slow-but-working one.

That premise does not survive this run.
A voice cut mid-reply after 3,020,068 characters is not slow-but-working.
The decision also records a latency table whose worst observation was 88.6 seconds, and set 180 as
"more than a factor of two" above it.
Against a model emitting millions of characters, the multiple of a healthy maximum is not the
quantity that matters.

The decision should not simply be reverted.
It was right that `hf:zai-org/GLM-5.2` was being cut inside its ordinary operating range at 60
seconds, and that is still true.
What has changed is that the population now contains a second kind of call the window was never
sized against, and one window cannot serve both.

## What this costs

The 34 cut voices fall into 29 distinct straggler events,
grouping voices cut within 5 seconds of each other as one round.
At 180 seconds each that is 1.45 hours of waiting, inside a run that has so far taken 3.73 hours.

That figure is an upper bound and should be read as one.
It holds only where the round's completion actually waits on the straggler.
`runStageRound` in `src/stage-round.ts` assembles its result from the `arrived` map rather than by
awaiting abandoned calls, precisely so a client that ignored an abort could not hang the stage,
so the true cost per event is at most the grace window and may be less.
Confirming it needs the dispatch timestamps the run does not currently record.

## The logging gap this exposes

The question "how concurrent was this run, and where did its wall-clock go" cannot be answered from
the run's own logs.

-   The client logs dispatch at `debug` (`-> modelId: N messages` in `src/synthetic-client.ts`).
-   This run emits only `info` and `warn`, 3,642 and 41 lines.
-   `reportStreamProgress` logs completion at `info` but carries no duration:
    its fields are `firstByte`, `maxGap`, raw characters, unreadable frames, content and reasoning
    characters.

So a stream's start time is not recoverable, and neither is its duration.
Adding a duration field to the existing completion line is the cheaper of the two fixes:
it adds no line volume, and start time follows by subtraction.

## What follows

-   `#211`'s fix routes `input_json_delta` to content, which is what lets any volume guard see this
    model at all. That is its real value, larger than the telemetry correction it was opened as.
-   `#211`'s recorded expectation, that the cut rate falls, is not supported.
    The likelier outcome is that the cut rate holds near 17 percent while each cut costs a fraction
    of the time and bytes, because `contentCap` fires long before 180 seconds.
    Record the outcome either way rather than the prediction.
-   The straggler window needs re-deriving against a population that now contains runaways.
-   Whether the reasoning channel should carry a volume cap of its own is a separate question.
    52 of 1,182 completed streams exceeded 32000 reasoning characters and completed fine,
    `hf:Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B` reaching 99,244, so a naive cap would cut working voices.

## The deepseek anomaly is the same defect, intermittently (resolved 2026-08-25)

`#211` recorded a second, smaller anomaly on `deepseek-v4-pro-0813` and held it open,
because the instrument used then was a 40-line scan window over 9 samples,
and a positive control on `hf:openai/gpt-oss-120b` showed that instrument had a 39 percent hit rate
on healthy calls.
Nine samples against a 39 percent baseline separate nothing, and the honest conclusion was that the
log could not answer it.

The same run answers it now, because the right instrument is the completion line's own content
count and this run carries roughly 1,200 of them.
Zero-content streams per seat, at 15 of 40 slices:

-   `qwen3.8-max`: 104 of 106, 98.1 percent.
-   `deepseek-v4-pro-0813`: 12 of 127, 9.4 percent.
-   `gemma-4-26b-a4b-it`: 0 of 127.
-   `deepseek-v4-flash-0731`: 0 of 127.
-   `minimax-m3`: 0 of 127.
-   `hf:openai/gpt-oss-120b`: 0 of 127.
-   `hf:nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-NVFP4`: 0 of 127.
-   `hf:moonshotai/Kimi-K3`: 0 of 127.
-   `hf:Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B`: 0 of 124.
-   `hf:zai-org/GLM-5.2`: 0 of 115.

THE BASELINE IS EXACTLY ZERO, not 39 percent.
Eight seats across roughly 1,000 streams produce not one zero-content call,
so 12 of 127 is not something a null distribution supplies.
Every one of the 12 carried reasoning characters above zero,
which is the same signature as `qwen3.8-max`: bytes arrived, and none were accounted to content.

The split follows the provider.
Both affected seats are served by Charm Hyper, which speaks the Anthropic protocol that
`src/anthropic-delta-scan.ts` reads, and every `hf:` seat on Synthetic is clean.
Three other Hyper seats are also clean, so this is not "the Hyper path is broken":
it is a frame pattern only some upstream models emit.

### What is still not settled, and the prediction that settles it

Why constant for one seat and intermittent for the other is not readable from the log.
`qwen3.8-max` is the one seat on `toolChoice: 'auto'`, so its whole answer always arrives as
tool-call arguments, which is exactly the delta type `#211` found misrouted.
For `deepseek-v4-pro-0813` two readings remain, and they differ in whether `#211`'s fix helps:

-   Same mechanism, occurring on 9.4 percent of calls because the duplicate
    `content_block_start` is what varies. `#211`'s fix removes all 12.
-   A different delta type, `text_delta` inside a thinking block, which `#211`
    deliberately does NOT exempt. The fix removes none of the 12.

That is a clean falsifiable prediction rather than an open question:
count zero-content streams for `deepseek-v4-pro-0813` on the first post-`#211` run.
Twelve becoming zero confirms the first reading; twelve staying put confirms the second and opens
its own task.
Do not fold the answer into `#211` before that count exists.
