# Screening appendix: every crates.io result

Appendix to [`tech-meow-cache-key-hash-vet-2026-09-17.md`](../tech-meow-cache-key-hash-vet-2026-09-17.md),
 section "Screening".
One entry per distinct crate returned by the crates.io queries CR01 to CR14 and XR01 to XR04,
 at its newest stable version on 2026-09-17.

How outcomes were assigned:

- Reviewed crates carry the outcome written in the report's candidate ledger.
- Crates with matches for both architectures or a SIMD abstraction,
   and not reviewed as hash libraries,
   were read by description and source layout and are category mismatches.
- Every other crate had intrinsic matches for at most one architecture
   and no SIMD abstraction in its non-test Rust sources,
   which fails HC1 regardless of category.
