# Technology vet: cli-git parser migration to CAC

Status:
 in progress.
 Lifecycle phase is discovered.
 Started and last updated on 2026-08-14.

Subject:
 cli-git parser migration to CAC.

Decision scope:
 assess whether CAC is practical for any or all repository-owned parser roles in
`@monochromatic-dev/git-policy-cli`.
Do not evaluate other external CLI parser technologies.

Governing skill:

- Commit is `a05818ad70a40e5769a36de669697ba109891b31`.
- SHA-256 is `393eb68c5b2b2f7b16c8f7f90c100fb8be43eefa4501511360cd0572e4ae8087`.

Compatibility fingerprint:
 `a48b54e274b6d6bda3057027fbcc2ced424ea8c0a00b03a2ce868425a534f986`.

Active audit owner:
 Pi session `01a00016-a9a0-747d-8174-191632f05b8e`.

Prior compatible report:
 none found.
The incompatible broader-scope report is
`doc/audit/tech-cli-git-parser-migration-to-cac-vet-2026-08-14.md`.
It stopped before external evidence collection when the user limited this audit to CAC.

## Context

The user asked whether migrating cli-git to CAC is practical,
then explicitly limited this session to CAC.
CAC is interpreted as the open-source npm CLI framework.
The target is `package/git-policy/cli/`.
The incumbent is inspected only as CAC's replacement-parity baseline.
No other external CLI parser technology will be discovered,
screened,
audited,
scored,
or ranked.
This report is an evaluation,
not adoption authority.
Product code,
dependencies,
configuration,
lockfiles,
and decision records remain unchanged.

The target no longer uses a third-party CLI framework.
Repository history shows that Optique was removed on 2026-07-15 by commits
`1e53f52e02989b152576c0683f6f228b24c40140`,
`4879a44e6a2460ab3c2531744e24a1f2aef27aeb`,
and
`be3c522375d9c2652f44921c7396233c93c2397d`.
The incumbent is therefore the repository-owned parser set.

The current parsing surface has separate roles:

- `src/parse-global-options.ts` locates Git's effective subcommand and applies chained `-C` semantics;
- `src/management-parser.ts` implements the closed `git cli-git` namespace;
- `src/parser/argv.ts` parses declared subsets of Git argv while retaining undeclared options;
- sibling parsers model Git-specific abbreviations,
  short clusters,
  option arity,
  last-option-wins toggles,
  pathspecs,
  and implicit branch creation.

The detailed incumbent inventory and live execution state are in
`doc/handover/cli-git-cac-migration.md`.

## Classification

The incumbent is repository-owned inspectable local technology.
External parser candidates must be inspectable open-source local technologies.

Applicable overlays:

- incumbent dependency replacement;
- high-trust execution,
  because the package shadows `git`,
  classifies and transforms commands,
  and gates safety policies;
- human auditability,
  because parser facts determine whether Git is blocked,
  transformed,
  or forwarded;
- multi-platform behavior across Linux,
  macOS,
  and Windows.

The native,
Wasm,
and prebuilt overlay applies only when a candidate introduces such a boundary.
A candidate with no such boundary records it as not applicable with inspected dependency evidence.
The managed-service,
SaaS,
privacy,
residency,
and browser overlays do not apply because parsing is local and receives argv rather than hosted or browser data.

## Hard constraints

A candidate and its proposed integration shape must satisfy every constraint:

- compatible inspectable open-source license;
- source-to-package provenance;
- no unaudited native,
  Wasm,
  generated,
  downloaded,
  or prebuilt runtime boundary;
- package Node range `^22.18.0 || >=24.11.0`;
- Linux,
  macOS,
  and Windows support;
- one self-contained MJS artifact and side-effect-free package import;
- exact pathspec and raw argv fidelity until cli-git explicitly owns a transformation;
- fail-closed guarded Git command classification;
- complete management grammar,
  output routing,
  early-help,
  and exit contracts from `package/git-policy/cli/SPEC.md`;
- relevant upstream and cli-git consumer-boundary validation;
- wrapper-added `wide-commit` latency at or below the maintained 925-millisecond ceiling.

## Frozen criteria

No priority ordering was supplied,
so every criterion has weight 1:

- net removal of repository-owned parser and adapter code;
- human auditability of parsing and forwarding;
- runtime and bundle overhead;
- direct and transitive runtime dependency surface;
- TypeScript inference and declaration compatibility;
- help and diagnostic control without process-global interception;
- upstream maintenance and release health;
- migration and regression-test burden;
- future management-command extensibility;
- fit with the existing pure-parser plus process-adapter seam.

Each criterion uses the rating scale from 0 through 4.
The maximum score is 40.
Hard-gate failures stay outside arithmetic.
No unresolved preference exists before evidence collection.

## Frozen discovery schedule

This is a CAC-only capability audit rather than a category selection.
Search results naming another parser are out of scope and will not become candidates.

### Npm registry

Use the official npm registry package and search APIs with default relevance order and no negative filter.
Run each literal lookup or query:

- exact package metadata for `cac`;
- exact version metadata for the current `cac` release;
- registry search `cac cli`;
- registry search `cac command line parser`.

Continue each search query until the registry reports exhaustion or two consecutive complete pages add no new CAC provenance,
package,
or taxonomy evidence.

### GitHub

Use the repository named by official npm metadata.
Inspect its code,
license,
releases,
CI,
security policy,
contribution policy,
issues,
pull requests,
and organization ownership.
Run these literal GitHub searches scoped to that repository where the API supports scope:

- `allowUnknownOptions`;
- `--`;
- `rawArgs`;
- `process.exit`;
- `help`;
- `TypeScript`;
- `Node 22`;
- `Windows`.

For tracker maintenance,
inspect every issue created or updated in the last twelve months when at most twenty exist,
otherwise the ten most recently updated issues.
Inspect the ten most recently updated pull requests by the same method.

### Broader web

Use the configured web search provider for each literal query:

- `CAC npm TypeScript CLI framework official`;
- `CAC allow unknown options parse argv`;
- `CAC double dash passthrough raw argv`;
- `CAC process exit help behavior`;
- `CAC CLI framework Git argv`;
- `CAC npm security vulnerability`.

The provider exposes no page cursor through this harness.
Record that limit and follow claims back to npm or CAC's repository.
Do not evaluate another parser surfaced by these searches.

### This repository

Run uncapped searches for:

- lowercase whole-word `cac`;
- uppercase whole-word `CAC`;
- `@optique` and `Optique` for migration history;
- `parseArgv` and `tryParseArgv`;
- `management-parser`;
- `argv` plus `parser`.

Inspect matching manifests,
catalog entries,
lockfile entries,
source,
tests,
troubleshooting records,
plans,
decisions,
audits,
and handovers.

### Expansion round

After the initial schedule:

1. Collect every new CAC synonym or feature term from official metadata.
2. Append one de-duplicated CAC-only query round to each applicable source.
3. Freeze the expanded schedule.
4. Record later terms without adding queries.

## Query ledger and saturation

No external query has run yet.
No source class is saturated.

## Candidate ledger

### Incumbent parity baseline

Discovery source:
 current repository manifest,
source,
tests,
history,
and user request to assess replacement.

Role:
 replacement-parity baseline only.
It is not an external technology candidate in this CAC-only audit.

Screening result:
 not applicable.
Its current behavior and maintained tests define what CAC integration must preserve.

### CAC

Discovery source:
 user-named candidate.

Base category:
 pending confirmation as inspectable open-source local technology.

Overlays:
 incumbent replacement,
high-trust,
human auditability,
and multi-platform.

Screening result:
 pending official registry,
repository,
license,
provenance,
source,
maintenance,
and runtime evidence.

## Evidence records

### Incumbent repository checkpoint

Candidate and revision:
 repository-owned parsers at
`54ad78083e8baf95c62d3b0682843967722c563d` before assessment documentation commits.

Claim and relevance:
 the incumbent is not one generic parser boundary.
The parser directory has twenty production TypeScript files and 3,953 physical lines,
while management parsing is one closed subset.
A migration must name which role it replaces before code-removal claims are meaningful.

Gate:
 replacement parity and human auditability.

Status:
 pass for inspectability;
validation remains pending.

Primary evidence:

- `package/git-policy/cli/src/management-parser.ts`;
- `package/git-policy/cli/src/parser/argv.ts`;
- `package/git-policy/cli/src/parser/branch-create.ts`;
- `package/git-policy/cli/src/parser/commit.ts`;
- `package/git-policy/cli/SPEC.md:500-566`;
- `doc/decision/cli-git-policies-platform.md:318-343`.

Outcome:
retain as replacement-parity baseline for CAC validation.

## Execution manifests

No third-party command tree has been executed.
Execution manifests will be written after source inspection and before any candidate install,
build,
test,
or consumer probe.

## Hard-gate exits

None yet.

## Validation results

Not started.

## Score arithmetic

Not started.
Only validated finalists will be scored.

## Sensitivity

Not started.

## Pros and cons

Not started.

## Ranking

No CAC practicality conclusion exists before discovery,
hard-gate confirmation,
validation of each viable CAC integration shape,
scoring,
and sensitivity analysis finish.
Other external parser technologies are out of scope.

## Evidence limits

The historical Optique timing in repository history is motivation for a latency gate,
not evidence about CAC.
The current audit has not yet inspected CAC source or reproduced candidate behavior.
