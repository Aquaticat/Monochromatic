# Technology vet: meow cache key hash, cryptographic hashes eligible

Status:
 complete.
Lifecycle phase:
 Recommended.
Recommendation:
 `twox-hash` 2.1.4 XXH3-128
 ("Recommendation").
Not adopted:
 this vet is deliberation.
No decision record exists,
 no dependency or configuration changed,
 and the design document is not updated by this vet.

Subject:
 meow cache key hash.

Decision scope:
 select a hash library,
 cryptographic or non-cryptographic,
 for the 128-bit content and cache keys of meow
 (placeholder name of the single-file all-Rust monorepo manager),
 replacing the planned `gxhash128`,
 with hardware acceleration on x86_64 and aarch64 Linux.

Start date:
 2026-09-17.

Last updated:
 2026-09-17.

Revision:
 the aarch64 criterion S5 is measured rather than borrowed.
The user powered `ssh m1` on and asked for the five finalists to be measured on it,
 so S5's ratings now come from five-run medians on one Apple M1 core
 instead of from upstream tables and source reading,
 and the aarch64 correctness gates were re-run on that silicon
 ("The `ssh m1` run").
The superseded inputs stay visible where they were used
 ("S5: aarch64 evidence", "Scoring").
The recommendation is unchanged;
 third and fourth place swapped.

Governing skill:

Prior report and reason for a new one:
 [`tech-meow-cache-key-hash-vet-2026-09-17.md`](tech-meow-cache-key-hash-vet-2026-09-17.md)
 (fingerprint `0c09784add54f3c69ce4d734f0e5a8ffeb0322ef178e4025506c3a173c40fac1`)
 has the same subject slug and date but a different fingerprint,
 because the user changed its hard constraints, deployment, and trust boundary
 ("Premise changes").
It is incompatible,
 so this report takes the same-day qualifier `600031ed`,
 the first eight fingerprint characters,
 which no other report occupies.
No compatible report exists.
Measurements from the prior report are reused only where "Reuse of prior evidence" says why they still apply.

## Context

Measured or read on 2026-09-17:

- meow is designed but not implemented
   (`doc/planning/monorepo-manager-from-scratch-design.md`, "Status");
   no code consumes a cache key hash,
   so the consumer boundary is exercised through probe binaries.
- Planned incumbent:
   `gxhash` 3.5.0 `gxhash128`,
   removed by the user on 2026-09-17 after seed-independent one-byte collisions
   (design doc, "Cache key hash after the collision findings").
- The prior vet recommended `twox-hash` 2.1.4 XXH3-128;
   the design recorded it as adopted and then withdrew it,
   because the user had not seen the brief and their answers changed its premises
   (design doc, "Cache key hash vet result").
- Cache key contents:
   task definition,
   argument vector,
   input file content hashes,
   declared environment,
   tool versions,
   the package's lockfile slice,
   dependency outputs,
   platform,
   and a salt
   (design doc, "Cache").
  Every declared output is recorded with a content hash,
   and dependency output hashes feed downstream keys.
- Workload,
   measured:
  - git-tracked files at `93ec584bf`:
     8,107 files,
     152,883,316 bytes,
     median 4,052 bytes,
     90th percentile 19,395,
     99th percentile 238,507,
     maximum 22,908,459
     (`git ls-files -z | xargs --null stat --format=%s`);
     the design doc records p50 4,043 and p90 19,244 for an earlier commit,
     and files of 64 KiB and above holding 66.15% of tracked bytes.
  - The benchmark corpus is the prior vet's snapshot of all 8,101 tracked files at `88cf6c0e4`
     (152,231,070 bytes,
     `~/temp/agent/hashvet-2026-09-17/data/files.bin`),
     whose distribution matches within a few bytes at every percentile.
  - Outputs up to 3,966,238,720 bytes
     (`package/dev-script/vm-builder/output/qcow2/disk.qcow2`)
     and music player debug binaries of 520 to 663 MB.
  - Short-string key composition carries weight 1 (user, 2026-09-17).
- Hashing premises,
   from the design doc "Hashing" and "Platforms and builds",
   as changed by the user on 2026-09-17:
   see "Premise changes".
- Toolchain:
   floating `nightly` in root `mise.toml:94`;
   this audit builds with `nightly-2026-09-12` (`rustc 1.100.0-nightly (0fc141305 2026-09-11)`),
   the same toolchain as the prior vet,
   and uses `nightly-2026-09-16` only for Miri.
- Target features,
   printed by `rustc --print cfg` with that toolchain:
  - `-Ctarget-cpu=x86-64-v4` enables `avx512f`, `avx512bw`, `avx512cd`, `avx512dq`, `avx512vl`
     on top of `avx2`, `bmi1`, `bmi2`, `fma`, `lzcnt`, `movbe`, `sse4.2`, and the lower levels;
     it does not enable `aes`, `pclmulqdq`, `sha`, `vaes`, `vpclmulqdq`, or `gfni`.
    AES-NI and SHA extension paths in an `x86-64-v4` build therefore come from run-time detection
     or from extra target features beyond the level.
  - `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` enables `neon` only;
     `aes`, `pmull`, `sha2`, `sha3`, and `crc` are not baseline,
     so crypto-extension paths on the release-blocking aarch64 builds need run-time detection
     or a raised aarch64 build with the startup check.
- Repository license for Rust crates:
   `LGPL-3.0-or-later` (`package/cli/forbidden-strings/Cargo.toml:21`).
- Development host:
   AMD Ryzen 7 8700F (Zen 4),
   8 cores and 16 hardware threads (`lscpu`),
   CPU flags including `avx512f`, `avx512bw`, `avx512vl`, `aes`, `vaes`, `pclmulqdq`, `vpclmulqdq`,
   `sha_ni`, and `gfni`,
   no SHA-512 instructions;
   62 GiB RAM;
   btrfs on LUKS on an NVMe drive;
   Fedora Atomic,
   kernel `7.2.0-ogc6.1.fc44.x86_64`.
- aarch64 hardware:
   one machine,
   reachable.
  `ssh m1` was powered off when this report was first written and was not contacted then.
  The user powered it on later the same day for the S5 measurement,
   and it is an Apple M1 `MacBookAir10,1` running macOS 27.0
   ("Execution manifest", aarch64 measurement host).
  It measures `aarch64-apple-darwin`,
   which is not a release-blocking target;
   the release-blocking aarch64 Linux targets are still checked for output equality under QEMU user mode.

## Premise changes

Relayed by the coordinator from the user on 2026-09-17,
 after the prior vet finished,
 and recorded in the design doc ("Hashing", "Platforms and builds"):

1.  "non-crypto isn't a requirement.
    I only said we don't necessarily need a crypto hash."
    Cryptographic hashes and MACs are eligible candidates,
     not controls.
2.  Weighting,
     answered "A",
     speed first:
     cryptographic hashes compete under the existing weights,
     whole-file throughput at weight 5 and quality beyond the one-byte gate at weight 1.
    The reasoning the user accepted:
     the cache is local and rebuildable,
     a repository able to craft collisions already runs its own tasks,
     and changing the hash later costs one cache rebuild.
3.  Builds:
     "We're planning to ship as many builds as possible.
     Shipping x86-64-v3 and x86-64-v4 as separate builds is fine."
    Then "v4 block only":
     among x86-64 builds only `x86-64-v4` is release-blocking;
     the baseline, `x86-64-v2`, and `x86-64-v3` builds ship without blocking.
    aarch64 glibc and static musl
     (the musl build a static-pie binary from a custom target)
     stay release-blocking.
    Every build raised above its target baseline gets meow's own startup check for its compiled target features
     (design doc, "Missing CPU capabilities"),
     so compile-time kernel selection is not a defect in a raised build.
4.  SIMD kernels count as hardware acceleration,
     and so do dedicated instructions
     (AES-NI, SHA extensions, PMULL, the Arm Cryptography Extension).
    The prior vet's two readings of the phrase collapse into one:
     either kind of path satisfies HC1.

Unchanged requirements:
 hardware acceleration on both x86_64 and aarch64,
 128-bit keys (a longer digest truncated to 128 bits is acceptable),
 stable output for persisted keys,
 streaming with chunking-independent output and bounded memory,
 and static musl builds on both architectures.

Effect on this report,
 against the prior report:

- HC1 now names both kinds of acceleration.
- HC2 admits truncation of a longer digest;
   concatenating two 64-bit hashes still does not qualify,
   because their collisions are correlated by construction.
- HC5 is met by meow's startup check in a raised build as well as by run-time dispatch.
- The decision scope,
   deployment,
   and trust boundary name cryptographic hashes,
   the build tiers,
   and the accepted collision reasoning,
   which changes the fingerprint.
- Soft criteria are refrozen ("Frozen soft criteria"):
   x86_64 throughput is decided on the `x86-64-v4` build,
   aarch64 throughput is reweighted,
   the lower builds get their own criterion,
   crafted-collision resistance joins quality at weight 1,
   and the CPU capability criterion is retired.

## Classification

- Base category for every library candidate:
   inspectable open-source local technology.
- Overlays:
  - Incumbent dependency replacement:
     the planned `gxhash` 3.5.0 `gxhash128` is replaced;
     keeping it is a candidate that exits on HC9.
  - High-trust execution:
     the library runs inside meow,
     which runs tasks locally and in CI with repository access;
     human-auditability measurements apply.
  - Native and generated-code boundary:
     SIMD, AES, and SHA intrinsics are `unsafe` native paths,
     and any build script, C, or assembly source is a provenance boundary.
  - Multi-platform claim:
     identical output on x86_64 and aarch64 and across dispatch paths.
- Not applicable:
   SaaS gates (no hosted component)
   and the sensitive-data overlay (inputs are repository files already on the machine, and nothing leaves it).

## Frozen hard constraints

A candidate must satisfy every constraint.
Hard gates stay outside score arithmetic.
Candidates are library and function pairs:
 one library exposing two functions with different speed or quality
 (for example SHA-256 and SHA-512)
 gives two candidates that share library-level evidence.

- HC1 hardware acceleration:
   a hardware-accelerated code path on both x86_64 and aarch64,
   either a designed SIMD kernel or dedicated instructions
   (AES, SHA, carry-less multiply, CRC).
  Scalar multiply-and-fold designs and compiler auto-vectorization without a designed vector path do not qualify.
- HC2 128-bit keys:
   a native 128-bit output,
   or a longer digest truncated to 128 bits.
  Concatenating two 64-bit hashes does not qualify.
- HC3 stability:
   output of the used function is documented or specified as stable across library releases
   (a published standard counts),
   and is identical on x86_64,
   aarch64,
   and every dispatch path.
- HC4 build:
   builds for `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`,
   `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`,
   `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`,
   and the aarch64 musl static-pie target
   with the repository's nightly toolchain,
   the accelerated paths compiled by rustc alone
   and linked by `rust-lld` on aarch64 musl,
   without a C or assembly toolchain.
  This follows today's build
   (design doc, "Build matrix": the static-pie aarch64 musl binary is built with `rust-lld` and no C cross compiler).
  Whether a C toolchain would be acceptable is an unresolved preference;
   "C toolchain branch" evaluates it conditionally.
- HC5 CPU capabilities:
   a missing required CPU capability yields a clear diagnostic instead of a crash,
   through run-time dispatch with a fallback
   or through meow's startup check for the compiled target features of a raised build.
- HC6 license:
   permits distribution inside an `LGPL-3.0-or-later` binary.
- HC7 provenance:
   inspectable source,
   a crates.io package that maps to repository source,
   and no prebuilt or downloaded artifacts.
- HC8 collision gate:
   zero full-width 128-bit collisions on the one-byte keysets
   (every single-byte variant of a zero 4096-byte base and of a random 4096-byte base,
   under several seeds or keys),
   checked after a positive control shows the harness finds known collisions.
- HC9 not gxhash:
   neither `gxhash` nor output derived from it.
- HC10 streaming:
   an incremental API whose output does not depend on chunking and equals the one-shot result,
   with memory bounded independent of input size.

### C toolchain branch

HC4-C is HC4 with a C compiler and assembler allowed for all four targets,
 including a C cross compiler for the aarch64 musl static-pie target.
Candidates that fail only HC4,
 or fail HC1 only because their accelerated path is C or assembly,
 are carried as branch candidates:
 they receive the speed measurements that decide their possible rank
 and bounded ratings for the rest.
If any branch candidate could enter the ranking above a finalist under the frozen weights,
 the question goes to the user with options;
 otherwise it closes with the bound that rules it out.

## Frozen soft criteria

Frozen before any candidate rating in this report.
Each rating uses 0 through 4 with a confidence;
 low-signal ratings carry a range.

### Criteria and weights

- S1 key-composition speed, weight 1:
   `x86-64-v4` build,
   workloads `fp` (70 to 242 byte fingerprint material)
   and `keymat` (per-package key material of 50 bytes to 50 KiB).
- S2 whole-file throughput, KiB to tens of MiB, weight 5:
   `x86-64-v4` build,
   workloads `files` (one call per tracked file),
   `files-stream64k` (a streaming hasher per file fed 64 KiB slices),
   and `hot16k` (one cache-resident 16 KiB buffer).
- S3 multi-GB throughput from disk, weight 5:
   `x86-64-v4` build,
   single-threaded streaming of the 3.97 GB image and the 663 MB debug binary,
   page-cache cold and warm,
   against read-only throughput of the same files.
- S4 multi-core hashing of one large input with stable output, weight 1.
- S5 aarch64 throughput, weight 5:
   in-memory whole-file and large-stream speed of each candidate's aarch64 path,
   from upstream-published or independent aarch64 measurements and from source analysis of that path;
   low-signal ranges,
   because no aarch64 hardware run happens here.
- S6 quality beyond HC8,
   including resistance to crafted collisions,
   weight 1.
- S7 stability assurance, weight 1:
   documented freeze or standard,
   golden vectors,
   tests comparing dispatch paths,
   and local cross-architecture equality.
- S9 auditability and dependency surface, weight 1:
   non-test lines on the used path,
   `unsafe` occurrences,
   runtime dependencies,
   build scripts and native code.
- S10 upstream verification, weight 1:
   tests,
   CI matrix,
   fuzzing,
   mutation testing,
   reference-vector comparisons.
- S11 maintenance, weight 1:
   releases,
   issue and pull request handling in the last 12 months,
   maintainer concentration.
- S12 throughput on the non-blocking x86-64 builds, weight 1:
   the S2 workloads on the baseline, `x86-64-v2`, and `x86-64-v3` builds.

Weights sum to 23,
 so the maximum is 92 points.

### Why these weights

- S2 and S3 stay at 5:
   the user's speed-first answer kept whole-file throughput at weight 5.
  They are decided on the `x86-64-v4` build because it is the only release-blocking x86-64 build.
- S5 rises from 1 to 5.
  aarch64 builds are release-blocking exactly as the `x86-64-v4` build is,
   and the user's weight 5 is for whole-file throughput,
   not for one architecture.
  The prior weight 1 described source-level evidence of what the aarch64 path accelerates;
   this criterion rates aarch64 throughput itself.
  It is one criterion rather than a mirror of both S2 and S3,
   because no aarch64 storage or page cache can be measured here,
   and the only aarch64 evidence is kernel speed,
   which would otherwise be counted twice
   (the skill counts overlapping evidence once under a primary criterion).
  So x86_64 carries 10 points of weight and aarch64 5;
   sensitivity raises S5 to 10 as a defined extra test.
- S12 is weight 1:
   the lower builds "ship but carry lower weight",
   and no number was given,
   so the skill's default for an unspecified priority applies.
  Multi-GB streaming is not repeated for these builds:
   storage and page-cache copy bound it,
   and those ceilings do not depend on the x86-64 level
   (the prior vet's read-only passes were within band between the baseline and `x86-64-v3` builds).
- S1 is weight 1 by the user's statement.
- S6 is weight 1 by the user's speed-first answer,
   which also moves crafted-collision resistance into it;
   the prior report had removed adversarial resistance from every denominator.
- S4, S7, S9, S10, and S11 have no stated priority and weight 1.

### Rating rules

- S1, S2, S3, and S12,
   one mechanical rule for every finalist:
   in each workload and build cell (and file and cache mode for S3),
   a finalist's ratio is its median over the best finalist's median,
   or 1 when its five-run range overlaps the best finalist's range;
   the criterion's value is the geometric mean of its cells,
   mapped to 4 at 0.90 or more,
   3 at 0.70,
   2 at 0.50,
   1 at 0.25,
   else 0.
  A value within 0.03 of a threshold gets medium confidence,
   otherwise high.
  This is the prior vet's rule unchanged.
- S5:
   the same thresholds applied to the evidence-supported range of each candidate's aarch64 speed
   as a ratio to the fastest candidate on the same aarch64 core;
   the rating is the range of mapped values,
   its midpoint the provisional rating.
  Criteria and rules are frozen and are not rewritten,
   so the clause "because no aarch64 hardware run happens here" stands as written;
   its premise later stopped holding,
   because the user powered the one aarch64 machine on
   ("The `ssh m1` run").
  The rule itself needed no change to absorb that:
   with all five finalists measured on one aarch64 core,
   each candidate's evidence-supported range is its five-run range,
   the overlap rule and the geometric mean over the S5 cells give one value per candidate,
   the ranges collapse to exact ratings,
   and the confidence rule frozen for S1, S2, S3, and S12 applies
   ("Scoring").
- S4 anchors:
  - 4:
     a library-provided parallel or tree mode whose output equals the single-threaded function,
     with a measured self-speedup of at least 4× at 8 threads on a 1 GiB in-memory input;
  - 3:
     such a mode with a self-speedup of 2× to 4×;
  - 2:
     such a mode with a self-speedup below 2×;
  - 1:
     no library mode;
     a meow-defined chunk construction would be a new output format meow owns;
  - 0:
     no stable parallel construction is possible.
- S6 anchors:
  - 4:
     no known structural statistical failure,
     and no known attack that crafts collisions below the generic 2^64 cost of a 128-bit truncation;
  - 3:
     no known structural statistical failure,
     but collisions can be crafted cheaply,
     because the function makes no collision-resistance claim when its key is known,
     or because a practical collision attack is published;
  - 2:
     statistical test failures that show no full-width collision at a fixed seed or key;
  - 1:
     full-width collisions at a fixed seed or key in statistical tests;
  - 0:
     structural collisions on simple keysets.
- S7, S9, S10, and S11 are rated from the recorded evidence with the anchors of the prior report,
   and each rating names its evidence.

### Criteria removed from every denominator

- S8 CPU capability handling:
   retired by premise 3;
   every raised build carries meow's startup check,
   and the speed effect of run-time dispatch is already rated by S2, S3, and S12.
- Price:
   every candidate is free.
- Binary size:
   no size limit is stated beyond rejecting a bundled Node runtime.
- Platforms beyond Linux:
   not release-blocking (user, 2026-09-16).

### Sensitivity procedure

- Each weight-1 criterion (S1, S4, S6, S7, S9, S10, S11, S12) raised to 2, 3, 4, and 5, one at a time.
- S2, S3, and S5 each lowered to 4, 3, 2, and 1, one at a time,
   because their weights map the user's words rather than numbers the user gave.
- S5 raised to 10, one extra defined test for full parity of aarch64 with x86_64 throughput.
- Every medium-confidence and low-confidence exact rating moved one step down and up within 0 to 4.
- Both endpoints of every low-signal range.

## Unresolved preferences

- A C toolchain in the build (HC4):
   evaluated through "C toolchain branch" and asked only if it can change the ranking.
- The relative weight of aarch64 and `x86-64-v4` throughput:
   mapped from the user's words ("Why these weights") and tested from S5 weight 1 through 10.

## Reuse of prior evidence

The prior vet ran earlier the same day on the same host,
 toolchains,
 container images,
 and crate versions.
Its scratch root is `~/temp/agent/hashvet-2026-09-17/`,
 and its clones are `~/temp/agent/{xxhash-rust,twox-hash,hashcrew,highway-rs,autobahn-hash,BLAKE3}-2026-09-17`.

Reused,
 with the reason each still applies:

- Discovery pages and results for CR01 to CR14, XR01 to XR04, GH01 to GH08, GC01 to GC03,
   XG01 to XG03, W01 to W10, and RP01 to RP06:
   fetched between about 05:00 and 06:00 UTC on 2026-09-17;
   registry and repository state within the same day,
   spot-checked by re-running named queries ("Discovery results").
  Their screening outcomes for non-cryptographic candidates are re-examined against the changed premises
   ("What the changed premises reopen").
- Identity, provenance, license, upstream suites, Miri, the `highway` fuzz campaign,
   source-size and maintenance audits,
   and the SMHasher3 records for `xxhash-rust` 0.8.18, `twox-hash` 2.1.4, `hashcrew` 0.3.0, and `highway` 1.3.0:
   the same archives and commits,
   and the same toolchains;
   a changed premise alters how they are rated,
   not what they show.
- HC3 equality runs,
   including the `x86-64-v4` musl probe and aarch64 under QEMU,
   the aarch64 half of which is now superseded by the Apple M1 runs
   ("Reference equality"),
   HC8 one-byte results at 8 to 4,096 bytes,
   HC10 streaming results on the baseline and `x86-64-v3` builds,
   and the C reference check,
   for those four crates and for the prior controls `blake3` 1.8.7 (default build),
   `sha2` 0.11.0 SHA-256, and `cmac` 0.8.0 with `aes` 0.9.3:
   same functions and versions.
  Builds not covered there,
   `x86-64-v4` and BLAKE3's `pure` build,
   are checked again here.

Not reused:

- Throughput numbers enter no rating.
  New candidates must be measured in the same container runs as the prior finalists,
   because a difference counts only against a band measured under the same conditions.
  The prior baseline and `x86-64-v3` medians serve as a reproduction check for the re-run.
- Ratings,
   scores,
   and sensitivity:
   the rubric changed.

## Discovery protocol

### Frozen query schedule

Frozen before any new query ran.
The schedule has three parts:
 the prior vet's executed schedule,
 reused;
 new queries for cryptographic and AES-based constructions;
 and one expansion round appended after the new queries.
Result pages are fetched unfiltered;
 screening happens after collection.

#### Reused schedule

The prior report's "Frozen query schedule" and its expansion round,
 executed with results recorded there:

#### Source class 1: crates.io registry

Endpoint `https://crates.io/api/v1/crates`,
 `per_page=100`,
 a generic User-Agent with no name or address,
 at most one request per second.
Default relevance sort for `q=` queries;
 `sort=downloads` for keyword and category listings.
Pages continue until the registry is exhausted or two consecutive complete pages add no screening survivor.

Metadata screening is backed by the prior vet's source scan
 (`scripts/crates-scan.ts`, never building or running an archive),
 extended in two ways for cryptographic code:

- aarch64 SHA-3 extension intrinsics (`veor3q`, `vrax1q`, `vxarq`,
   `vbcaxq`) and SM3 intrinsics join the dedicated-instruction patterns.
- A crate without intrinsics of its own is marked as delegating
   when a runtime dependency is a crate with accelerated paths
   (for example `aes`, `sha2`, `sha1`, `blake3`, `keccak`, `polyval`, `ghash`, `ring`, `aws-lc-rs`,
   `openssl`, `graviola`),
   and every delegating hash or MAC crate is reviewed by hand;
   the prior scan could not see acceleration held by a dependency.

#### Source class 2: GitHub

`gh api search/repositories` and `search/code`,
 `per_page=100`,
 best-match order,
 pages until exhaustion or two consecutive pages without a new screening survivor;
 each query is capped at 1,000 results by the API.

Hash-family indexes:
 the SMHasher3 results list (cryptographic families),
 and the eBACS hash-function measurement list (`bench.cr.yp.to/results-hash.html`),
 with every family that has an x86_64 and an aarch64 accelerated implementation screened at family level.

#### Source class 3: broader web

Linkup search,
 `depth` standard,
 no domain filter;
 the provider exposes no page cursor,

#### Expansion round

After the new queries:

1.  Collect new taxonomy terms from the candidate ledger.
2.  Append one de-duplicated query per applicable source class.
3.  Freeze the schedule.
4.  Record later terms without new queries.

## Discovery results

Executed 2026-09-17.
Raw pages:
 `~/temp/agent/hashvet2-2026-09-17/data/crates/` and `data/github/`;
 web results in `data/web/`;
 crate archives under `data/crate-src/` and the prior vet's `crate-src/`.

### Source class 1: crates.io

Every query used `per_page=100` and the User-Agent `hash-library-survey/1.0`.
No result was filtered out before screening.
The prior vet's CR01 to CR14 and XR01 to XR04 results are reused ("Reuse of prior evidence");
 the new queries are listed with their own results.

Source-scan method,
 extending the prior vet's
 (`scripts/crates-scan.ts`, which never builds or runs an archive):

- Each result's newest stable `.crate` archive was downloaded from `static.crates.io` and extracted;
   archives the prior vet had already extracted were reused.
- Non-test Rust files were searched for x86 intrinsics,
   aarch64 intrinsics
   (now including the SHA-3 extension intrinsics `veor3q`, `vrax1q`, `vxarq`, `vbcaxq` and the SM3 intrinsics),
   SIMD abstractions,
   `asm!` and `global_asm!` macros,
   128-bit outputs,
   build scripts,
   and C, C++, or assembly files.
- Every crate's runtime dependencies were parsed from its manifest,
   and a crate whose dependency is itself an accelerated crate
   (`aes`, `sha2`, `sha1`, `blake3`, `keccak`, `polyval`, `ghash`, `ring`, `aws-lc-rs`, `openssl`,
   `graviola`, and others)
   is marked as delegating,
   because the prior scan could not see acceleration held by a dependency.
- Totals:
   5,092 distinct crates scanned,
   102 with intrinsics for both architectures,
   44 with a SIMD abstraction,
   74 with an `asm!` or `global_asm!` macro,
   226 with C, C++, or assembly sources,
   2,095 delegating to an accelerated dependency,
   63 without a downloadable stable version.
- Triage:
   3,113 crates were listed for review because their name or description names a hash, MAC, digest, or checksum,
   or because they carry one of those signals
   (`scripts/triage.ts`, `data/triage.txt`);
   623 carry a signal and a hash-like name (`data/triage-strong.txt`),
   and every one of those was read by hand.

Pagination:
 CC01, CC02, CC03, and CC21-crypto had a survivor on their third page or later,
 so paging continued;
 CC01 and CC02 ran to the tenth page,
 where two consecutive complete pages added no survivor.
No other query needed more than its first complete pages.
Result:
 source class 1 is saturated.

### Expansion round

New taxonomy terms from the ledger:
 AES-round universal hash (LeMac, PetitMac),
 multi-buffer and batch hashing,
 hash chains,
 Xoodoo and Xoodyak,
 CubeHash,
 sponge hash over AES.
One de-duplicated round ran:
 XC01 to XC04 on crates.io,
 XG04 and XG05 on GitHub (both returned 0 results),
 and one web query.
It found `xoodoo` 0.1.0 (the earlier name of `xoodyak`, x86-only intrinsics),
 `xoofff`,
 `permutation-xoodoo`,
 `sha3-kernel-hasher` (x86-only),
 `oxicrypt-cmac` (over `oxicrypt-aes`, whose AES is portable software with no AES instructions),
 and the LeMac and PetitMac artifact,
 which ships C and Python reference implementations only
 (`github.com/AugustinBariant/Implementations_LeMac_PetitMac`, read 2026-09-17),
 so it has no Rust crate (HC7) and no rustc-only build (HC4).
The schedule is frozen;
 later terms were recorded without new queries.

### Source class 2: GitHub

`gh api search/repositories` and `search/code`,
 best-match order,
 `per_page=100`;
 every query ran until GitHub returned fewer than 100 items on a page,
 so none reached the 1,000-result cap
 (`scripts/gh-query.ts`, pages in `data/github/`).
Libraries found only here were checked against the crates.io API.

Hash-family indexes:

- SMHasher3 `results/README.md`
   (saved by the prior vet at `~/temp/agent/hashvet-2026-09-17/data/smhasher3-results-readme.md`,
   546 lines):
   the "Passing hashes" table (hashes that pass all tests) lists these cryptographic families:
   `blake3`,
   `blake2s` at 128, 160, 224, and 256 bits,
   `blake2b` at 128 to 256 bits,
   `SHA-2-224` and `SHA-2-256`,
   `SHA-1`,
   `MD5`,
   `SHA-3`,
   and the Ascon CXOF instances.
  Every cryptographic entry passes;
   the AES-based non-cryptographic entries
   (`aesnihash-peterrk` with 41 failures, `aesnihash-majek` with 64, `t1ha0.aesA` and `t1ha0.aesB` with 5)
   are in the "Failing hashes" table,
   which is the reason the vet treats an AES-round universal hash as needing its own quality evidence
   rather than inheriting AES's.
  The index reports quality and speed,
   not which instruction sets an implementation uses,
   so acceleration is established per crate in screening, not from this table.
- eBACS `primitives-hash.html` (fetched 2026-09-17, 172 primitives, 1,115 implementations,
   `data/web/ebacs-hash-impls.txt`):
   primitives with both an x86 vector or AES implementation and an Arm NEON or ARMv8 implementation are
   `blake3`, `blake256`, `blake512`, `blake2b`, `bmw512`, `cubehash512`, `cubehash1632`, `groestl256`, `groestl512`,
   `k12`, `keccak` variants, `lsh256`, `lsh512`, `luffa256` to `luffa512`, `romulush`, `round3jh256`, `round3jh512`,
   the SHA-3 and SHAKE instances, and `xoodyakv1`.
  Each family was looked up in the class 1 results:
   Rust crates exist for BLAKE3, BLAKE2, Grøstl, JH, CubeHash, Keccak, SHA-3, K12, LSH, Luffa, Xoodyak, and Romulus
   and are screened there;
   BLAKE-256 and BLAKE-512 (SHA-3 round-3 candidates) and BMW have no accelerated Rust crate.

### Source class 4: this repository

- RP07 `sha256|sha-256|sha512|sha3|keccak|kangarootwelve|blake2|blake3|cmac|pmac|polyval|ghash|graviola`
   (`rg --count-matches --ignore-case` excluding `node_modules` and lockfiles):
   TypeScript uses of Node's SHA-256 (file-enforcer, `watch-restart`, `aquati.cat`, `kv-store`,
   `markdown-lint` LFS object ids),
   pnpm SRI SHA-512 notes,
   the stack research documents,
   and `package/cli/forbidden-strings/src/runtime_cache/path.rs:73`,
   which hashes with `gix_hash::hasher(gix_hash::Kind::Sha256)`.
- RP08 lockfile packages
   (every `Cargo.lock` under `package/`):
   `sha2` 0.10.9 (`cli/forbidden-strings`, `cli/forbidden-strings.fuzz`, `cli/nested-wayland-session`),
   `sha2` 0.11.0 (`rust-module/forbidden-regex.bench`),
   `sha1` 0.10.6 and 0.10.7 with `sha1-checked` 0.10.0 (through `gix-hash`),
   `aes` 0.8.4 and `sha1_smol` 1.0.1 (music player, through `turso_core`),
   `twox-hash` 2.1.2 (music player);
   no `ring`, `aws-lc-rs`, `openssl`, `boring`, `blake3`, `blake2`, `sha3`, or `hmac`.
  So `sha2` is already a repository dependency in Rust packages,
   and `twox-hash` a transitive one.

## Screening

Screening applies the category definition and the hard constraints that can be settled from source,
 licence metadata,
 and published documentation.
Gates that need a build or a measurement
 (HC4 build, HC5 diagnostics, HC8 collisions, HC10 chunking independence)
 are settled in "Hard-gate outcomes",
 so a crate can leave screening as a serious alternative and still exit at a gate later.

Every crate reviewed by hand carries its outcome in
 `~/temp/agent/hashvet2-2026-09-17/scripts/review.json`
 (118 entries).
The per-crate outcome for all 5,092 scanned crates is published beside this report as
 [`tech-meow-cache-key-hash-vet-2026-09-17-600031ed/screening-crates.md`](tech-meow-cache-key-hash-vet-2026-09-17-600031ed/screening-crates.md).

### What the changed premises reopen

The premise change makes cryptographic and AES-based constructions candidates rather than controls,
 so the whole cryptographic side of the field enters screening for the first time:
 BLAKE3,
 SHA-256,
 SHA-512,
 SHA-1,
 KangarooTwelve and the Keccak family,
 CubeHash,
 Xoodyak,
 AES-CMAC,
 and AES-PMAC,
 across `rscrypto`, `blake3`, `sha2`, `sha1`, `graviola`, `purecrypto`, `cryptoxide`,
 `bitcoin_hashes`, `scytale`, `k12`, `cubehash`, `xoodyak`, `cmac`, and `pmac`.
The prior vet had carried `sha2` SHA-256 and AES-CMAC only as controls
 ("Cryptographic functions carried as controls" in the prior report).

No previously-excluded non-cryptographic candidate reopens.
Each prior non-cryptographic exit was re-read against the new premises,
 and every one rests on a gate the premises did not touch:

- `gxhash` 3.5.0:
   HC9 is a user decision of 2026-09-17,
   unchanged by the weighting and build premises;
   its `Hasher` output also still depends on write chunking (HC10).
  It is the HC8 positive control.
- `rotohash-rs` 0.1.2,
   the one non-cryptographic function with dedicated-instruction paths on both architectures
   (AES-NI with AVX2 or VAES with AVX-512, NEON with the AES extension):
   HC10, one-shot API only,
   and HC3, no stability statement.
  Neither depends on which build blocks a release or on how speed is weighted.
- `hashcodecs` 1.4.1: HC10 for XXH3-128, HC1 for its scalar aarch64 MurmurHash3.
- `ahash`, `foldhash`, `drtahash`, `t1ha`, `axhash-core`, `mm3h`: HC2 or HC3, width and stability.
- The CRC and Adler crates: HC2, outputs of 64 bits or fewer.
- `museair`, `rapidhash`, `komihash`, `wyhash`, `seahash`, `siphasher`, and the other scalar 64-bit designs:
   HC1 and usually HC2.
  `museair` is carried as the scalar non-cryptographic speed control.
- `meowhash`: HC1 (aarch64 disabled since 0.2) and HC3.
- C-backed crates (`umash-sys`, `xxhash-c-sys`, `stringzilla`, `fasthash`): HC4,
   and they enter the C toolchain branch only.

The build premise does change one thing inside screening,
 and it helps cryptographic candidates rather than non-cryptographic ones:
 an accelerated path that the compiler selects from raised target features
 (AVX-512 under `-Ctarget-cpu=x86-64-v4`, `+aes`, or a `--cfg` backend)
 now satisfies HC1 on the release-blocking `x86-64-v4` build,
 because meow owns the startup check for a raised build.
That is what keeps `k12` in,
 whose x86 vector backend exists only under `--cfg keccak_backend="simd128|simd256|simd512"`.

### Serious alternatives

Eighteen crates leave screening;
 `aes` enters as the block-cipher backend for two of them rather than as a hash.
Because a candidate is a library and function pair,
 they carry 23 candidate functions into hard-gate confirmation,
 named here by their lab wrapper
 (`~/temp/agent/hashvet2-2026-09-17/lab/src/lib.rs`):

- XXH3-128:
   `xxhash_rust_xxh3_128` (`xxhash-rust` 0.8.18),
   `twox_xxh3_128` (`twox-hash` 2.1.4),
   `hashcrew_xxh3_128` (`hashcrew` 0.3.0),
   `rscrypto_xxh3_128` (`rscrypto` 0.9.0).
- HighwayHash-128:
   `highway_128` (`highway` 1.3.0).
- BLAKE3:
   `blake3_128` (`blake3` 1.8.7, with the C and assembly build note),
   `rscrypto_blake3_128` (`rscrypto`, keyed, `global_asm!` kernels).
- SHA-256:
   `sha2_sha256_128` (`sha2` 0.11.0),
   `rscrypto_sha256_128`,
   `graviola_sha256_128` (`graviola` 0.4.1),
   `purecrypto_sha256_128` (`purecrypto` 0.9.0),
   `cryptoxide_sha256_128` (`cryptoxide` 0.6.5),
   `bitcoin_hashes_sha256_128` (`bitcoin_hashes` 1.2.0),
   `scytale_sha256_128` (`scytale` 0.5.0).
- SHA-512:
   `sha2_sha512_128`,
   `rscrypto_sha512_128`,
   and `graviola_sha512_128`,
   which is measured although `graviola` has no aarch64 SHA-512 kernel (HC1 there).
- SHA-1:
   `sha1_128` (`sha1` 0.11.0).
- Keccak family:
   `k12_128` (`k12` 0.5.1 over `keccak` 0.2.2).
- Sponges and permutations:
   `cubehash512_128` (`cubehash` 0.4.1),
   `xoodyak_128` (`xoodyak` 0.8.4).
- AES-based MACs:
   `aes_cmac_128` (`cmac` 0.8.0 with `aes` 0.9.3),
   `aes_pmac_128` (`pmac` 0.8.0 with `aes`).
- Controls, not candidates:
   `museair_128` (`museair` 0.6.0, scalar non-cryptographic reference)
   and `gxhash_128` (`gxhash` 3.5.0, HC8 positive control, built only in the `v4-gxref` variant).

Screening notes that travel with a survivor into the gates:

- `blake3` 1.8.7:
   Rust SSE2, SSE4.1, and AVX2 kernels;
   AVX-512 and NEON exist only as C and assembly compiled by `build.rs`
   (`c/blake3_neon.c`, `c/blake3_avx512_x86-64_unix.S`).
  A rustc-only build therefore has no aarch64 vector path,
   which is an HC1 and HC4 question settled with measurements,
   and it is the reason the C toolchain branch exists.
- `k12` 0.5.1:
   the `keccak` backends are the aarch64 SHA-3 extension (run-time detected)
   and nightly `portable_simd` lanes under `--cfg keccak_backend`;
   without the cfg the x86 path is scalar.
- `graviola`, `purecrypto`, `cryptoxide`, and `scytale`:
   accelerated on both architectures for SHA-256 only;
   their other functions are single-architecture and exit at HC1.

### Exits

Grouped by reason,
 with the full per-crate list in the published screening appendix:

- HC1, no accelerated path on both architectures:
   `blake2`, `blake2b_simd`, `blake2s_simd`, `blake2-rfc`, `blake2_ce` (x86 only or portable),
   `tiny-keccak`, `kangarootwelve`, `turboshake`, `cshake`, `shake`, `sha3`, `sha3_ce`
   (the `keccak` default x86 backend is scalar),
   `libcrux-sha3` and `p3-keccak` (their SIMD modules hash several messages in parallel,
   while a single message takes the portable or `tiny-keccak` path),
   `lib-q-keccak`,
   `md-5` and `fast-md5` (whose "assembly cores" are scalar unrolled rounds, `src/aarch64.rs:16-20`),
   `shaman`,
   `groestl`, `groestl-aesni` (AES-NI on x86 only), `skein`, `sm3`, `streebog`, `whirlpool`, `ripemd`,
   `ascon-hash`,
   `areion` (x86-only AES-round hash, last release 2023),
   `blake3-std`.
- HC2, output narrower than 128 bits:
   `crc-fast`, `crc64fast`, `crc64fast-nvme`, `stringzilla`, `ahash`, `drtahash`, `axhash-core`,
   and the scalar 64-bit family.
- HC3, output stability not established:
   `sponge-hash-aes256` (a bespoke AES-256 sponge with no published specification or stability statement),
   `meowhash`,
   `ahash`,
   `foldhash`,
   `t1ha`.
- HC4, C or assembly compiled by a build script:
   `ring`, `ringpcx`, `aws-lc-rs`, `openssl`,
   `sha2-asm`, `sha1-asm`, `sha3-asm`, `md5-asm`, `sha2_ce`, `sha2raw`, `sha2ni`,
   `blake2b-rs`, `blake2_c`,
   `kangarootwelve_xkcp`, `marsupial-sys`,
   `hashtree-rs`, `lonesha256`, `skein-ffi`, `flatline-umac`,
   `fasthash-sys`, `fasthash-sys-fork`,
   the four `ckb-opt-*` crates.
  These are the C toolchain branch population;
   only `blake3` among them has a Rust fallback and a plausible rank,
   so the branch measures `blake3` and treats the rest as bounded by it.
- HC6, licence:
   `keccak-batch`, AGPL-3.0-or-later, which cannot be distributed inside an LGPL-3.0-or-later binary.
- HC7, provenance:
   `sha3-selkie` (published only as 0.0.0),
   and the repositories with no crates.io package
   (`tachyon-rs`, `openhitls-rs`, `byt3forg3/Tachyon`, `r_crypto`, the LeMac and PetitMac artifact).
- HC9:
   `gxhash`.
- HC10, no chunking-independent streaming state:
   `hashcodecs`, `xxh3`, `rotohash-rs`, `tape-sha256` (batch and hash-chain APIs only), `gxhash`.
- Category mismatch:
   universal hashes needing consumer-chosen key material and padding
   (`polyval`, `ghash`, `polyhash`, `halftime`),
   fixed-length AES-round compression (`haraka`),
   batch-only designs (`md5-many`),
   adapters and meta crates (`noncrypto-digests`, `hashkit`, `crypto-hashes`, `multihash-codetable`),
   keyed constructions over a candidate hash (`hmac`, evaluated through `sha2`),
   `sha1-checked` (collision detection more than doubles SHA-1's cost, evaluated through `sha1`),
   wrappers (`sha256`, `sha-1`),
   forks and duplicates (`iroh-blake3`, `fluence-blake3`, `fleek-blake3`, `tidecoin_hashes`),
   and `spg-crypto`, `gmcrypto-core`.
- Screened through another crate rather than on its own:
   `aes` (the block cipher behind `cmac` and `pmac`),
   `keccak` (the permutation behind `k12`).

## Identity, provenance, and license

Every crate was taken from its crates.io archive at the version in the lab lockfile,
 extracted under `data/crate-src/`
 (this vet's directory for crates the prior vet had not fetched, the prior vet's for the rest),
 and its repository metadata read through the GitHub API on 2026-09-17
 (`data/crate-meta.tsv`, `data/repo-meta.tsv`, `data/archive-sha256.tsv`, `data/source-audit.tsv`).
No candidate ships a prebuilt or downloaded artifact,
 so HC7 passes for every survivor;
 the crates that failed HC7 exited in "Screening".

Licence outcome (HC6):
 every survivor is distributable inside an `LGPL-3.0-or-later` binary.
The licences are BSL-1.0, MIT, Apache-2.0, MIT OR Apache-2.0, Apache-2.0 OR ISC OR MIT-0,
 BSD-2-Clause, CC0-1.0, and for `blake3`
 CC0-1.0 OR Apache-2.0 OR Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception.
The one AGPL crate found in discovery, `keccak-batch`, exited at screening.

Two notes on the counts:

- `rscrypto`'s 58 assembly files are ECC bignum routines under `src/auth/asm/`,
   included with `global_asm!(include_str!(...))` and assembled by rustc.
  Its BLAKE3 assembly lives under `src/hashes/crypto/blake3/{x86_64,aarch64}/asm/`
   and is assembled the same way,
   which is why the aarch64 builds succeed without a C toolchain ("HC4 build").
- `blake3`'s 26 C and assembly files are its AVX-512 and NEON kernels,
   compiled by `cc` from `build.rs`,
   which is the C toolchain question.

## Hard-gate outcomes

Each gate is settled for every serious alternative before any scoring.
Source citations are file paths inside the crate archive under `data/crate-src/`;
 build and run evidence is in `data/hc4-builds.txt`,
 `data/build-variants.txt`,
 `data/correctness.txt`,
 and the container logs under `data/logs/`.

### HC1 hardware acceleration

Kernel inventory,
 from a scan for architecture intrinsics and for dedicated-instruction mnemonics inside `asm!` blocks
 (`scripts/hc1-paths.ts`, `data/hc1-paths.tsv`):

- XXH3-128,
   SIMD kernels on both architectures:
   `xxhash-rust` (`src/xxh3.rs`: SSE2, AVX2, AVX-512, NEON),
   `twox-hash` (`src/xxhash3/large/{sse2,avx2,neon}.rs`),
   `hashcrew` (`src/xxhash/kernel/{x86,neon}.rs`),
   `rscrypto` (`src/hashes/fast/xxh3/{x86_64_avx2,x86_64_avx512,aarch64_neon}.rs`).
  Pass.
- HighwayHash-128:
   `highway` (`src/x86/avx.rs`, `src/x86/v4x64u.rs`, `src/aarch64.rs`).
  Pass.
- BLAKE3:
   `rscrypto` has Rust AVX2, AVX-512, and SSE4.1 kernels plus NEON intrinsics in
   `src/hashes/crypto/blake3/{x86_64/{avx2,avx512,sse41}.rs,aarch64.rs}`,
   with assembly variants in the same tree assembled by rustc.
  Pass.
  `blake3` 1.8.7 has Rust SSE2, SSE4.1, and AVX2 only;
   its AVX-512 and NEON kernels are `c/blake3_avx512_x86-64_unix.S` and `c/blake3_neon.c`,
   compiled by `cc` in `build.rs`.
  With the `pure` feature, or on any target without a C compiler,
   aarch64 gets no vector path.
  Fail on aarch64 under HC4's rustc-only rule;
   carried in the C toolchain branch.
- SHA-256,
   SHA extensions on x86_64 and the Armv8 SHA-2 extension on aarch64:
   `sha2` (`src/sha256/x86_sha.rs`, `src/sha256/aarch64_sha2.rs`),
   `rscrypto` (`src/hashes/crypto/sha256/{x86_64,aarch64}.rs`),
   `graviola` (`src/low/x86_64/sha256.rs`, `src/low/aarch64/sha256.rs`),
   `purecrypto` (`src/hash/sha_hw.rs`),
   `bitcoin_hashes` (`src/sha256/crypto/{x86_shani,avx2,sse41,arm_sha2}.rs`),
   `scytale` (`src/hash/sha2/{x86_64,aarch64}.rs`, dedicated instructions inside `asm!`),
   `cryptoxide` (`src/hashing/sha2/impl256/{avx,sse41,aarch64}.rs`),
   whose x86_64 kernels are AVX and SSE4.1 message-schedule code and whose SHA-NI arm is commented out
   (`src/hashing/sha2/impl256/mod.rs:26`),
   and whose paths are chosen at compile time from `target_feature`,
   so its aarch64 kernel needs a build raised with `+sha2`.
  Pass on both architectures as SIMD, with that build condition.
- SHA-512:
   `sha2` (`src/sha512/x86_avx2.rs` AVX2, `src/sha512/aarch64_sha3.rs` using the Armv8.2 SHA-512 instructions)
   and `rscrypto` (`src/hashes/crypto/sha512/{x86_64_avx2,x86_64_avx512vl,aarch64}.rs`).
  Pass.
  `graviola` has `src/low/x86_64/sha512.rs` and no aarch64 counterpart:
   fail.
  `scytale` states in `src/hash/sha2/x86_64.rs` that SHA-384 and SHA-512 stay portable on x86_64:
   fail.
  `purecrypto`'s SHA-512 hardware path is aarch64 only:
   fail.
- SHA-1:
   `sha1` (`src/compress/x86_sha.rs`, `src/compress/aarch64_sha2.rs`).
  Pass.
- AES-CMAC and AES-PMAC through `aes` 0.9.3:
   AES-NI and VAES on x86_64 (`src/backends/{x86_aes,x86_vaes256,x86_vaes512}/encdec.rs`),
   the Armv8 AES extension on aarch64 (`src/backends/aarch64_aes/encdec.rs`).
  Pass.
- KangarooTwelve through `keccak` 0.2.2:
   the Armv8.2 SHA-3 extension on aarch64 (`src/backends/aarch64_sha3.rs`, run-time detected)
   and, on x86_64, `portable_simd` lanes selected by `--cfg keccak_backend="simd128|simd256|simd512"`.
  Pass on the release-blocking build,
   which sets that cfg;
   without it the x86 path is scalar.
- CubeHash:
   `cubehash` (`src/avx2.rs`, `src/sse2.rs`, `src/neon.rs`).
  Pass.
- Xoodyak:
   `xoodyak` (`src/xoodoo/impl_x86_64.rs`, `src/xoodoo/impl_aarch64.rs`).
  Pass.

### HC2 width

Native 128-bit output:
 XXH3-128,
 HighwayHash-128,
 AES-CMAC,
 AES-PMAC.
Truncation of a longer digest to its first 128 bits,
 which HC2 allows:
 BLAKE3 (256-bit digest and XOF),
 SHA-256,
 SHA-512,
 SHA-1 (160 bits),
 KangarooTwelve (XOF),
 CubeHash-512,
 Xoodyak (XOF squeeze).
All pass.

### HC3 stability

Every candidate function is a published specification or has a documented freeze:

- XXH3-128:
   frozen in xxHash 0.8.0 and specified in the xxHash specification;
   the four implementations agree with each other and with the reference vectors
   ("Reference equality").
- HighwayHash-128:
   the HighwayHash specification and the reference implementation's vectors.
- BLAKE3:
   the BLAKE3 specification and reference vectors.
- SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512:
   FIPS 180-4.
- AES-CMAC:
   NIST SP 800-38B.
- AES-PMAC:
   the PMAC specification with its published vectors.
- KangarooTwelve:
   the KangarooTwelve specification and its XKCP vectors.
- CubeHash:
   the CubeHash specification (rev3 parameters `16/32/512`, as the crate names them).
- Xoodyak:
   the Xoodyak specification from the NIST lightweight cryptography process.

`rscrypto` states the rule its accelerated kernels follow explicitly:
 "Portable Rust implementations are the reference path; SIMD and ASM are accelerators tested against that path"
 (`README.md`).
All pass.

### HC4 build

Builds of the lab crate with the repository's nightly (`nightly-2026-09-12`),
 rustc alone,
 no C toolchain in the container
 (`data/hc4-builds.txt`):

- `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, default features: status 0.
- `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, default and `-Ctarget-cpu=x86-64-v4`: status 0.
- `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`, default features: status 101.
  The failure is `blake3`'s build script:
   "Compiler family detection failed due to error: ToolNotFound: failed to find tool `aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc`"
   (`data/logs/hc4-aarch64-gnu-default.log`).
- `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` with `rust-lld`, default features: status 101,
   the same `blake3` build-script failure with `aarch64-linux-musl-gcc`.
- `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` with `rust-lld`, feature `pure` (BLAKE3 without its C kernels): status 0.
- `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`, feature `pure`: the compile succeeds and the link fails in the lab harness only,
   because the host `rust-lld` rejects `--fix-cortex-a53-843419` for a non-AArch64 host build;
   rebuilt with `--lib`, status 0 (`data/logs/hc4-aarch64-gnu-pure-lib.log`).
  This is a harness artifact, not a candidate defect,
   and matches the prior vet's compile-only aarch64 evidence.

So every candidate except `blake3` builds for all four targets with rustc alone.
`blake3` fails HC4 as published and passes only with its `pure` feature,
 which costs it HC1 on aarch64.
`rscrypto` passes although its BLAKE3 has assembly,
 because the assembly is inside `global_asm!` and rustc assembles it.

### HC5 CPU capabilities

Run-time detection with a fallback:
 `twox-hash`,
 `hashcrew`,
 `sha2`,
 `sha1`,
 `aes`,
 `bitcoin_hashes`,
 `scytale`,
 `keccak` (aarch64),
 `graviola` (which additionally asserts its required features at construction),
 `rscrypto` (`src/platform/detect`).
Compile-time selection:
 `xxhash-rust`,
 `cryptoxide`,
 `cubehash`,
 `xoodyak`,
 and `keccak`'s x86 lanes.
Under premise 3 both are acceptable:
 meow performs its own startup check on every raised build,
 and the baseline features these crates select at the default target
 (SSE2 on x86_64, NEON on aarch64) are part of both targets' baselines.
All pass.

### HC6, HC7, HC9

Pass for every serious alternative ("Identity, provenance, and license").
No candidate is `gxhash` or derived from it;
 `gxhash` is built only as the collision-harness positive control.

### HC8 one-byte collision gate

Harness:
 `lab/src/bin/onebyte.rs`,
 every single-byte variant of a 4,096-byte base
 (1,044,480 keys per function and seed),
 counted for full 128-bit,
 low 64-bit,
 and high 64-bit equality,
 over a zero base and a random base,
 with seeds 0, 1, and 987654321.

First pass on the `x86-64-v4` build
 (`data/logs/onebyte-zero-v4.log`, `data/logs/onebyte-random-v4.log`):
 57 results per base,
 covering the XXH3-128, HighwayHash, BLAKE3, SHA-256, SHA-512, SHA-1, AES-CMAC, and AES-PMAC candidates
 and the `museair` control,
 with zero collisions at every width.
The `bitcoin_hashes`, `scytale`, `cubehash`, `xoodyak`, and `k12` wrappers were added to the lab after that pass,
 so the gate was re-run for the full table,
 together with the `gxhash` positive control from the `v4-gxref` build
 (`data/correctness.txt`, "Re-run of the correctness gates").

### HC10 streaming

Harness:
 `lab/src/bin/streamcheck.rs`,
 which compares the streaming result with the one-shot result
 for 607 input lengths from 0 to 5,000,011 bytes
 under 14 chunk plans each
 (1, 7, 16, 32, 63, 64, 65, 240, 241, 256, 1024, 4096, 65,536, and random chunk sizes).

First pass on the `x86-64-v4` build:
 19 streaming functions,
 8,548 chunkings compared each,
 0 failures
 (`data/logs/streamcheck-v4.log`).
Positive control,
 the same run with `STREAMCHECK_CONTROL=drop-last`,
 which withholds the last input byte:
 162,146 mismatches
 (`data/logs/streamcheck-control-v4.log`),
 so the harness detects a wrong streaming result.
As with HC8,
 the five wrappers added later are covered by the re-run.

### Re-run of the correctness gates

Both gates were re-run on the current `x86-64-v4` build,
 with the whole candidate table
 (`scripts/correctness.ts`, `data/correctness.txt`):

- HC8,
   4,096-byte bases,
   zero and random,
   seeds 0, 1, and 987654321:
   72 results per base
   (24 functions by three seeds),
   every one with 0 full-width, 0 low-half, and 0 high-half collisions
   (`data/logs/onebyte-v4-zero.log`, `data/logs/onebyte-v4-random.log`).
- HC8 positive control,
   `gxhash` from the `v4-gxref` build:
   2 full-width collisions on the zero base and 1 on the random base under every seed
   (`data/logs/onebyte-v4gxref-zero.log`, `data/logs/onebyte-v4gxref-random.log`),
   which reproduces the finding that removed `gxhash`
   and shows the harness detects collisions when they exist.
- HC10,
   24 streaming functions,
   8,548 chunkings each:
   5,155 failures,
   all of them `xoodyak_128`.
  The run was repeated with a per-function counter to settle the attribution:
   23 of the 24 functions report "0 failed" over 8,548 chunkings each,
   and `xoodyak_128` reports 5,155
   (`data/logs/streamcheck-v4-perfn.log`).
  The positive control run,
   which withholds the last input byte,
   reported 204,816 failures,
   so the harness detects a wrong streaming result.

`xoodyak` is the one HC10 failure,
 and the reason is in its API rather than in the permutation:
 `XoodyakCommon::absorb` absorbs one complete message with domain separation
 (`src/xoodyak/mod.rs:119-123`),
 so calling it once per chunk is not the same operation as one absorb of the whole input,
 while `absorb_more` continues an absorb only at multiples of the absorb rate
 (`src/xoodyak/mod.rs:125-131`).
A consumer could add its own rate-aligned buffer and obtain chunking independence,
 so this is a limit of the crate's incremental API as published,
 not of Xoodyak.
Either way `xoodyak` is rated 0 on S2 and cannot affect the ranking,
 so the gate is recorded as failed for the published API and the candidate is not carried further.

## Execution manifest

Shared by every execution in this vet:

- Host:
   AMD Ryzen 7 8700F,
   8 physical cores and 16 logical,
   62 GiB memory,
   Linux 7.2.0-ogc6.1.fc44.x86_64,
   `podman` 5.8.4.
- Container:
   `docker.io/library/rust:slim`,
   digest `sha256:a2de23e559fd8afd260d22beb00f3987073ea0dcc2ba2646cccdaeda6a62a095`,
   run with `--rm --init --memory=2g --cpus=2 --pids-limit=512 --ulimit nofile=4096 --network=none`
   and `--security-opt label=disable`,
   no credentials mounted,
   no repository mounted.
  The scratch tree is mounted at `/w`;
   the toolchain and the Cargo registry are mounted read-only;
   `CARGO_HOME` points inside the scratch tree
   (`scripts/run-box.ts`).
  Every run appends a record with its command, image digest, bounds, exit status, and log path to
   `data/logs/executions.jsonl`.
- The one exception to the standing bounds is the multi-core scaling test,
   which raises `--cpus` to at most 8
   (half of the host's 16 logical cores)
   with `--memory=8g`;
   each of those records states the raised bounds
   ("S4 multi-core hashing of one large input (weight 1)").
- Toolchains:
   `nightly-2026-09-12` (`rustc 1.100.0-nightly`) for the lab, every lab binary, and the aarch64 builds;
   `nightly-2026-09-16` for Miri;
   `1.98.1` for upstream suites that pin a stable toolchain.
- Lab crate:
   `lab/`,
   `opt-level = 3`,
   fat LTO,
   one codegen unit,
   `panic = "abort"`,
   lockfile generated on 2026-09-17 with `cargo +nightly-2026-09-12 generate-lockfile`
   and fetched on the host,
   because only the host's Cargo may reach `index.crates.io`;
   containers run `--offline --locked`.
- Builds measured
   (`scripts/build-variants.ts`, `data/build-variants.txt`, all status 0):
  - `base`: default target features, `--cfg keccak_backend="simd128"`.
  - `v2`: `-Ctarget-cpu=x86-64-v2`, same Keccak backend.
  - `v3`: `-Ctarget-cpu=x86-64-v3`, `--cfg keccak_backend="simd256"`.
  - `v4`: `-Ctarget-cpu=x86-64-v4`, `--cfg keccak_backend="simd512"`, the release-blocking build.
  - `v4-pure` and `base-pure`: the same with `blake3/pure`, for the C toolchain branch.
  - `v4-par`: the same as `v4` with `rscrypto/parallel`, for the scaling test.
  - `v4-gxref`: the same as `v4` with `-Ctarget-feature=+aes` and `gxhash`, for the HC8 positive control only.
- The release-blocking build enables no SHA or AES instruction feature ("Context", target features).
  Crates that dispatch at run time (`sha2`, `sha1`, `aes`, `bitcoin_hashes`, `scytale`, `graviola`, `rscrypto`)
   still reach those instructions;
   crates that select at compile time (`cryptoxide`) do not,
   which their numbers show.
- Measurement discipline:
   the run-to-run band is measured first on the unchanged `x86-64-v4` build,
   five runs per cell,
   each run its own container,
   load average recorded before and after every run.
  Another agent's build work ran on this host during part of the campaign;
   the affected runs are visible in `data/bench/progress-a.txt`,
   and the per-cell medians over five runs are what the ratings use.

### aarch64 measurement host

Added on 2026-09-17 when the user powered the machine on for the S5 measurement
 ("The `ssh m1` run").

- Host:
   `MacBookAir10,1`,
   Apple M1 (`T8103`),
   four Firestorm performance cores and four Icestorm efficiency cores,
   64 KiB L1 data cache,
   4 MiB L2,
   16 GiB memory (17,179,869,184 bytes),
   macOS 27.0 build `26A428`,
   Darwin 27.0.0 (`xnu-13432.1.9`, `RELEASE_ARM64_T8103`),
   reached over `ssh`.
  It is a fanless chassis,
   which is why every run records its thermal state
   ("S5: aarch64 evidence", thermal and load state).
- No container:
   macOS has no equivalent of the bounded `podman` runs used on the x86 host,
   so the lab binaries run as ordinary processes.
  The bounds that matter here are memory and concurrency,
   and the workloads that could breach either are the ones this host does not run.
- Storage,
   per `AGENTS.md` rule `HRM`:
   everything the measurement writes lives under
   `/Volumes/MacData/agent/hashvet2-m1-2026-09-17`
   (external volume, 216 GiB free at the start, 215 GiB at the end),
   including `CARGO_HOME`, `RUSTUP_HOME`, both `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` trees, the corpus, and the probe crates.
  `CACHEDIR.TAG` is written in the build, Cargo, and rustup directories.
  The internal SSD had 114 GiB free at the start and hosts none of it
   (one exception and its cleanup: "The `ssh m1` run", what was installed).
- Memory and concurrency:
   `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=4` for every build and `RAYON_NUM_THREADS=4` for every benchmark run,
   so nothing exceeds four of the eight cores;
   the benchmark itself is single threaded,
   and the only multi-threaded entry in the streaming table is `blake3_128_rayon`,
   which is not a finalist.
  The workloads that need multiple GB in memory,
   `mem256m-stream1m` and the multi-GB `bigfile` runs,
   are not run here:
   S3 is frozen to the `x86-64-v4` build and the machine caps memory at 16 GiB.
- Toolchain:
   `nightly-2026-09-12` (`rustc 1.100.0-nightly (0fc141305 2026-09-11)`),
   the same toolchain and the same commit as every x86 build,
   installed into the scratch `RUSTUP_HOME` with the minimal profile.
  The machine's own `nightly-aarch64-apple-darwin` and its default-toolchain setting are untouched.
- Builds measured
   (`scripts/m1-build.ts`, `m1/build.log`):
  - `m1-generic`: `-Ctarget-cpu=generic`, `neon` and nothing above the aarch64 baseline.
  - `m1-native`: the target default, which adds `aes`, `sha2`, `sha3`, `crc`, and `dotprod`,
     plus the `gxref` feature for the one-byte collision control.
  The `bigfile` binary is not built here:
   it calls `rustix::fs::fadvise`,
   which `rustix` 1.1.4 configures out on Apple targets
   (`doc/troubleshooting/rustix-apple-fadvise-gate.md`).
- Lab crate,
   profile,
   flags,
   lockfile,
   corpus,
   rounds,
   and run count are the x86 campaign's,
   and the corpus bytes are byte identical on both machines
   ("S5: aarch64 evidence").
- Measurement discipline:
   the run-to-run band is measured first on the unchanged build,
   five runs per cell,
   with load averages, thermal state, and swap recorded before and after every run
   (`m1/bench-progress.txt`).
  The machine was in use by its owner throughout,
   so per-cell medians over five runs are what the ratings use,
   as on the x86 host.

## Hard-gate confirmed

Twenty of the 23 candidate functions pass every gate:

- Confirmed:
   `xxhash-rust` XXH3-128,
   `twox-hash` XXH3-128,
   `hashcrew` XXH3-128,
   `rscrypto` XXH3-128,
   `highway` HighwayHash-128,
   `rscrypto` BLAKE3,
   `sha2` SHA-256 and SHA-512,
   `rscrypto` SHA-256 and SHA-512,
   `sha1` SHA-1,
   `graviola` SHA-256,
   `purecrypto` SHA-256,
   `cryptoxide` SHA-256,
   `bitcoin_hashes` SHA-256,
   `scytale` SHA-256,
   `cmac` with `aes` AES-CMAC,
   `pmac` with `aes` AES-PMAC,
   `k12` KangarooTwelve,
   `cubehash` CubeHash.
- Exited at a gate:
   `blake3` BLAKE3,
   which fails HC4 as published (no aarch64 build without a C cross compiler)
   and fails HC1 on aarch64 with its `pure` feature;
   and `graviola` SHA-512,
   which has no aarch64 kernel (HC1);
   and `xoodyak` Xoodyak,
   whose published incremental API is not chunking independent (HC10, "Re-run of the correctness gates").
  `scytale` SHA-512 and `purecrypto` SHA-512 had already exited at screening for the same reason,
   so they are not candidates here.
  `graviola` SHA-512 is still measured,
   because it bounds what an x86_64-only SHA-512 could contribute,
   and `blake3` is measured in both builds for the C toolchain branch.

### Which confirmed candidates receive equal-depth validation

The deciding criteria are the three weight-5 ones,
 and S2 is already measured for every confirmed candidate on the release-blocking build
 ("S2 whole files, KiB to tens of MiB (weight 5)").
Applying the frozen rating rule to the three S2 cells:

- 4: `xxhash-rust` 0.997, `twox-hash` 0.979, `hashcrew` 0.963, `rscrypto` 0.944 (XXH3-128).
- 1: `highway` 0.281.
- 0: every other confirmed candidate,
   from `aes_pmac` 0.113 and `rscrypto` BLAKE3 0.097 down to `xoodyak` 0.006.

A candidate rated 0 on S2 scores at most
 0 + 5·(its S3 rating) + 5·(its S5 rating) + 8·4 points.
Its measured S5 evidence caps it further:
 on the one aarch64 core with published numbers,
 SHA-256 through the SHA extensions runs at 1.69 GiB/s and single-threaded BLAKE3 at 1.61,
 against 24.5 for XXH3-128,
 so every cryptographic candidate rates 0 on S5 as well
 ("S5: aarch64 evidence").
That leaves at most 5·(S3 rating) + 32,
 and S3 is bounded by the cold and warm measurements
 ("S3 multi-GB from disk (weight 5)"):
 no candidate rated 0 on S2 can pass 42 of 92 points.
The four XXH3-128 candidates already hold 20 points from S2 alone
 and score at least 45 from the weight-5 criteria,
 so the ranking of the top places cannot include a candidate rated 0 on S2.

Equal-depth validation therefore runs for the five candidates that can reach the top:
 the four XXH3-128 implementations and `highway`.
Every other confirmed candidate is rated from the evidence collected for all candidates alike
 (the same benchmark runs, the same gates, the same source and maintenance audits)
 and carries the bound shown here;
 no rating for them is left unstated,
 and none of them can change the recommendation.
Four of the five validated candidates were validated to this depth in the prior vet earlier the same day,
 on the same host,
 toolchains,
 and crate versions ("Reuse of prior evidence");
 `rscrypto` is new and receives the same treatment here.

## Upstream suites

### Reused for the four prior finalists

The prior vet ran the CI-equivalent suites for `xxhash-rust` 0.8.18, `twox-hash` 2.1.4, `hashcrew` 0.3.0,
 and `highway` 1.3.0 earlier the same day,
 on this host,
 with the same clones,
 crate versions,
 and toolchains
 (its section "Upstream CI inventory and suites run").
Every suite exited 0 with no failed test.
The evidence that matters for the ratings here:

- `xxhash-rust`:
   five suites (debug, release under Valgrind, `+avx2`, `-sse2`, aarch64 under QEMU),
   12 tests each,
   0 Valgrind errors.
  Its XXH3 test compares one-shot and streaming `xxh3_128` against the C library
   for random inputs of every length 0 to 4,095.
- `twox-hash`:
   all-features tests,
   a comparison package with property tests against the C implementation,
   Miri with the scalar kernel forced,
   and two aarch64 QEMU suites;
   one ignored test outside XXH3.
- `hashcrew`:
   workspace tests,
   a no-default-features build,
   a release integration suite,
   Miri with strict provenance,
   and the integration suite on aarch64 under QEMU (43 tests).
- `highway`:
   tests in debug, release, and `no_std`,
   four instruction-set variants,
   Miri,
   a no-panic example,
   aarch64 under QEMU,
   and a fuzz target that compares the 64-bit output with the C implementation.

### New: `rscrypto` 0.9.0

Inventory from the clone at tag `v0.9.0`
 (commit `1ce6a015cb4df8e84b72b997fb2fa50c04af1609`,
 `~/temp/agent/rscrypto-2026-09-17`, push remote disabled):
 six workflows,
 `ci.yml` (cross-build for riscv64, powerpc64le, and s390x, then native jobs per platform),
 `bench.yml`,
 `ct.yml` (constant-time validation),
 `fuzz.yml`,
 `profile.yml`,
 and `release.yml`.
The `ci.yml` native job runs `just ci-check`, `just test --all --release`,
 `just test --all --release --portable`,
 `just test-musl` on x86_64 and aarch64,
 and constant-time, policy, and script suites.
Its runners are AWS instances declared in `.github/runs-on.yml`.

Equivalents run here,
 offline,
 in `localhost/hashvet-rusttest:2`
 with the clone at `/src`
 and `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` inside the scratch tree
 (`scripts/suites.ts`, results in `data/suites.txt`):
 release library tests,
 the same with `portable-only`,
 the integration tests,
 a build with `-Ctarget-cpu=x86-64-v4`,
 a build with `-sha,-aes,-avx2` to exercise the fallback kernels,
 the library tests on `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` under QEMU,
 the library tests on `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`,
 and Miri over the hash modules.

### Suite results

First attempt,
 recorded because it shows a real property of the crate:
 the five stable-toolchain suites exited 1 without running a test,
 because the image's `cargo` is a rustup shim and `rust-toolchain.toml` in the clone pins 1.98.0,
 which rustup then tried to download inside a network-less container
 (`data/logs/rs1-test-release.log`).
The suites were re-run with the mounted toolchain's real `cargo` first on `PATH`,
 which ignores that file,
 and with explicit features,
 because `rscrypto` compiles each algorithm behind a feature and a default-feature test run compiles almost none of them
 (the first aarch64 run passed 89 tests; the Miri run filtered out all 71 it saw).

Suites that ran to completion in the first pass:

- `rs6` `cargo test --release --lib --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` under QEMU,
   default features:
   89 passed, 0 failed.
- `rs8` `cargo miri test --lib hashes::` on `nightly-2026-09-16` with `-Zmiri-strict-provenance`:
   exited 0 with 0 tests matching the filter under default features.
- `rs9` build of the `fast-xxh3` fuzz target with AddressSanitizer and libFuzzer coverage:
   exited 0.
- `rs10` that target run for 600 seconds:
   46,844,896 executions,
   78,398 executions per second,
   coverage 1,437 features,
   139 new corpus units,
   peak RSS 452 MB,
   no crash and no artifact written
   (`data/logs/rs10-fuzz-run.log`).
  Every one of those executions asserted `rscrypto`'s XXH3-64 and XXH3-128 one-shot results,
   and its streaming results under arbitrary partitions,
   against `xxhash-rust` as the oracle.
- `rs7` `cargo test --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` exited 101:
   its dev-dependency `aws-lc-sys` needs a C cross compiler for musl,
   which this container does not have.
  Recorded as an omitted job with that reason;
   the musl build of the candidate itself is covered by HC4.

Second pass,
 with the mounted toolchain's `cargo` and the feature set meow would enable
 (`std,xxh3,blake3,sha2`),
 all exited 0 with no failed test
 (`scripts/suites2.ts`, `data/suites.txt`):

- `rs11` release library tests: 147 passed.
- `rs12` the same with `portable-only`, which forces the portable reference kernels: 147 passed.
- `rs13` integration tests: 204 passed across 142 test binaries.
- `rs14` the same library tests with `-Ctarget-cpu=x86-64-v4`: 147 passed.
- `rs15` the same with `-Ctarget-feature=-sha,-aes,-avx2`, which forces the fallback kernels: 147 passed.
- `rs16` library tests on `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` under QEMU: 139 passed.
- `rs17` `cargo miri test --lib hashes::fast` on `nightly-2026-09-16` with `-Zmiri-strict-provenance`: 7 passed.

So the crate's own tests pass on the release-blocking build's target features,
 on the portable path,
 on the fallback path,
 and on aarch64,
 and its XXH3 module carries no undefined behaviour that Miri detects on the paths it reaches.

## Reference equality

`lab/src/bin/refcheck.rs`,
 run on the `x86-64-v4` build
 (`data/logs/refcheck-v4.log`):
 4,261 checks,
 0 failures.

What it checks:

- Published digests,
   truncated to the 128-bit key width:
   SHA-256, SHA-1, and SHA-512 of `"abc"` from FIPS 180-4,
   the BLAKE3 hash of the empty input,
   and XXH3-128 of the empty input in its canonical form
   (`99aa06d3014798d86001c324468d497f`).
- Cross-implementation equality over 266 input lengths from 0 to 1,048,577 bytes:
   the four XXH3-128 crates against each other,
   the seven SHA-256 crates,
   the three SHA-512 crates,
   and the two BLAKE3 crates.

Positive control:
 the same binary with `REFCHECK_CONTROL=flip`,
 which flips one input byte before hashing while comparing against the unflipped reference,
 reported 4,261 failures of 4,261 checks
 (`data/logs/refcheck-v4-control.log`),
 so the harness detects a wrong digest.

This is the local half of HC3:
 four independent XXH3-128 implementations agree with each other and with the published digest,
 and the same holds inside the SHA-256, SHA-512, and BLAKE3 families,
 on the release-blocking build's kernels.

### Against the C implementations, on aarch64 silicon

The prior vet's `refcheck/` crate links the C references into one binary:
 xxHash 0.8.3 `XXH3_128bits_withSeed` through `xxhash-c-sys` 0.8.7,
 and `HighwayHash128` from `google/highwayhash` `c/highwayhash.c` at `faca2cb`.
This vet copied it to `refcheck-c/` and added `rscrypto` as the fifth finalist,
 then built and ran it on the Apple M1
 (`scripts/m1-refcheck-c.ts`, `m1/logs/refcheck-c-run.log`).
The C sources are compiled by Apple `clang` from `/usr/bin/cc` on that machine,
 only for this check;
 no finalist needs a C toolchain.

For every length 0 to 4,100,
 plus 8,191 to 8,193, 65,535 to 65,537, 100,003, 1,048,583, and 16,777,219 bytes of random data,
 it compares each finalist's one-shot output and its streaming output over random chunks of
 1 to 70,000 bytes with C,
 under seeds 0 and `0x9E3779B97F4A7C15` for XXH3
 and the all-zero key and a byte-sequence key for HighwayHash:

- `aarch64-apple-darwin`:
   4,110 lengths,
   82,200 checks,
   0 mismatches.
- Positive control,
   `REFCHECK_CONTROL=flip`,
   which flips one input bit on the Rust side only:
   82,200 mismatches of 82,200 checks
   (`m1/logs/refcheck-c-control.log`).

The prior vet ran the same binary without `rscrypto` on the x86_64 baseline build,
 the `x86-64-v3` build,
 and an aarch64 glibc build under QEMU,
 with 0 mismatches each and its own control at 65,760 of 65,760
 (prior report, "Reference equality").
So all five finalists now agree with the C reference implementations on real aarch64 hardware,
 not only under emulation.

### Cross-architecture digest equality

`lab/src/bin/corpusdigest.rs` prints,
 per finalist and seed,
 digests of 266 fixed synthetic inputs and an accumulator over every file in the benchmark corpus
 (8,101 files, 152,231,070 bytes),
 plus individual digests at lengths 0, 1, 63, 64, 128, 240, 241, 1,024, and 65,536.
Run on the `x86-64-v4` build in the usual bounded container and on the `m1-generic` build
 (`scripts/digest-run-x86.ts`, `scripts/m1-digest.ts`,
 `m1/corpusdigest-v4.txt`, `m1/corpusdigest-m1-generic.txt`):

- 60 of 60 output lines are byte identical between `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` and `aarch64-apple-darwin`.
- Positive control,
   `CORPUSDIGEST_CONTROL=flip` on the aarch64 side:
   0 of 60 lines identical.

This is HC3's cross-architecture half measured on silicon for the corpus meow would actually hash,
 rather than inferred from emulation.
The release-blocking aarch64 Linux targets are still covered by the QEMU suites
 ("Upstream suites")
 and by the prior vet's aarch64 and musl probes for the four reused finalists.

## Additional validation

### Fuzzing and property tests

Reused from the prior vet for the four crates it validated:
 `xxhash-rust` has no fuzz target and no property tests,
 only a random-input comparison with the C library in `tests/assert_correctness.rs`;
 `twox-hash` has `proptest` comparisons with C in `comparison/`;
 `hashcrew` has seeded random partitions in `tests-integration`;
 `highway` has a `quickcheck` property suite and a libFuzzer target that compares
 its portable, SSE4.1, and AVX2 hashers with the C implementation,
 which the prior vet built and ran for 600 seconds with AddressSanitizer,
 against a control build with an injected defect.
No finalist has mutation testing.

`rscrypto` is the one finalist with a fuzz target for XXH3 itself.
`fuzz-packages/fast-xxh3/fuzz_targets/fast_xxh3.rs` runs
 `fuzz/target_impls/fast_xxh3.rs`,
 which for arbitrary input and seed asserts:

- `Xxh3::hash_with_seed` equals `xxhash_rust::xxh3::xxh3_64_with_seed`;
- `Xxh3_128::hash_with_seed` equals `xxhash_rust::xxh3::xxh3_128_with_seed`;
- streaming through arbitrary partitions,
   including empty writes,
   equals the one-shot oracle for both widths;
- the default-seed and explicit-zero-seed results agree.

So its oracle is another finalist,
 which makes any disagreement between the two visible.
This vet built that target with AddressSanitizer and libFuzzer coverage instrumentation
 and ran it for 600 seconds
 ("Suite results").

### Extra one-byte keysets

The prior vet ran the HC8 harness at key lengths 8, 16, 64, 128, 240, 241, 1,024, and 2,048 bytes,
 zero and random bases,
 seeds 0, 1, and 987654321,
 for its four finalists and `gxhash`:
 every finalist result had zero collisions at every width,
 while `gxhash` collided at 1,024 and 2,048 bytes under every seed.
This vet repeats that sweep with `rscrypto` added and `gxhash` again as the positive control
 ("Re-run of the correctness gates").

### Extra keyset results

The sweep ran on the `v4-gxref` build for the five finalists and `gxhash`
 at lengths 8, 16, 64, 128, 240, 241, 1,024, and 2,048 bytes,
 zero and random bases,
 seeds 0, 1, and 987654321
 (`data/logs/onebyte-len*.log`, 16 runs, 18 results each):

- Every finalist result has 0 full-width, 0 low-half, and 0 high-half collisions at every length, base, and seed.
- `gxhash` collides at 1,024 bytes on the random base and at 2,048 bytes on both bases,
   under every seed,
   for example `30ecc446309af95305f3d807d3b2eec9` from two one-byte variants of the same 2,048-byte base.
  This reproduces the finding that removed it and keeps the harness honest.

### Correctness gates re-run on aarch64 silicon

HC8 and HC10 were re-run on the Apple M1,
 on both builds,
 with the same positive controls
 (`scripts/m1-correctness.ts`, `m1/logs/`, `m1/correctness.txt`):

- HC8,
   the one-byte keyset at 4,096 bytes,
   zero and random bases,
   seeds 0, 1, and 987654321,
   for the five finalists on `m1-native` and on `m1-generic`:
   1,044,480 keys per result,
   0 full-width, 0 low-half, and 0 high-half collisions in every one of the 60 results.
- Positive control,
   the same harness on `gxhash` on `m1-native`:
   two full-width collisions on the zero base and one on the random base,
   under every seed,
   for example `16e7e83e37895468e6d238de457ff0c1` from positions 755 and 1,785 of the zero base.
  So the collision harness looks on this architecture too.
- HC10,
   `streamcheck` over 612 input lengths,
   14 chunkings each and 4 for the two inputs above 100,000 bytes:
   8,548 chunkings compared with the one-shot per function,
   0 failures for each of the five finalists,
   on both builds.
  The only failures in the run are Xoodyak's 5,155,
   the same count and the same digests as on `x86-64-v4`,
   which is the HC10 exit already recorded
   ("Re-run of the correctness gates").
- Positive control,
   `STREAMCHECK_CONTROL=drop-last`,
   which withholds the final input byte:
   196,282 failures,
   every function reporting 8,534 of 8,548.
- `lab/src/bin/refcheck.rs` on both m1 builds:
   4,261 checks,
   0 failures,
   with its `REFCHECK_CONTROL=flip` control at 4,261 of 4,261
   ("Reference equality").

## Benchmarks

Workload inputs are the measured repository corpus described in "Context":
 `data/files.bin` and `data/files.idx` hold every tracked file's bytes
 (8,101 files, 152,231,070 bytes),
 `data/keymat.bin` the per-package key material,
 `data/fp-lengths.txt` the fingerprint lengths.
Each run is its own bounded container;
 each container runs two rounds of the workload;
 a cell's value is the median over five runs of the better round.

### Run-to-run band

Measured first on the unchanged release-blocking `x86-64-v4` build,
 five runs per cell,
 213 build and workload cells in the summary
 (`scripts/bench-a-summary.ts`, `data/bench-a-summary.tsv`):
 the median cell spans 1.9% between its slowest and fastest run,
 the 90th percentile 5.4%,
 the widest 18.6%
 (`aes_pmac_128` on `files`).
Among the finalists the widest bands are `hashcrew` on `files-stream64k` (8.7%)
 and `twox-hash` on `keymat` (8.5%).
So a difference under about 5% between two finalists in one cell is not resolved by this harness,
 which is what the frozen overlap rule encodes.

### S2 whole files, KiB to tens of MiB (weight 5)

`x86-64-v4` build,
 medians of five runs, GiB/s:

- `files`, one call per tracked file:
   `hashcrew` 47.74,
   `rscrypto` 47.45,
   `twox-hash` 47.42,
   `xxhash-rust` 47.03,
   (`museair` control 32.01),
   `highway` 15.28,
   AES-PMAC 5.89,
   `blake3` 4.64,
   `rscrypto` BLAKE3 4.33,
   SHA-1 2.43,
   SHA-256 2.24 to 2.27 across `bitcoin_hashes`, `sha2`, `graviola`, `rscrypto`, and `scytale`,
   AES-CMAC 1.78,
   `purecrypto` SHA-256 1.77,
   KangarooTwelve 0.92,
   SHA-512 0.74 to 0.82,
   CubeHash 0.77,
   `cryptoxide` SHA-256 0.47,
   Xoodyak 0.32.
- `files-stream64k`, a streaming hasher per file fed 64 KiB slices:
   `xxhash-rust` 44.38,
   `hashcrew` 44.08,
   `twox-hash` 43.91,
   `rscrypto` 37.38,
   `highway` 15.01,
   AES-PMAC 5.89,
   `blake3` 4.48,
   `rscrypto` BLAKE3 4.46.
- `hot16k`, one cache-resident 16 KiB buffer:
   `rscrypto` 73.70,
   `xxhash-rust` 73.27,
   `twox-hash` 69.38,
   `hashcrew` 65.93,
   `highway` 15.16,
   `blake3` 7.53,
   `rscrypto` BLAKE3 7.45,
   AES-PMAC 6.58,
   SHA-1 2.41,
   SHA-256 2.24 to 2.27.

Geometric means of the three cells against the best finalist in each,
 with the overlap rule applied
 (`scripts/s2-ratios.ts`):
 `xxhash-rust` 0.997,
 `twox-hash` 0.979,
 `hashcrew` 0.963,
 `rscrypto` 0.944,
 all rating 4;
 `highway` 0.281, rating 1;
 every other candidate 0.113 or less, rating 0.

The gap that decides the shape of the ranking:
 the fastest cryptographic candidate on this workload,
 AES-PMAC with AES-NI and VAES,
 runs at 12% of XXH3-128's speed on whole files,
 BLAKE3 at 10%,
 SHA-256 with the SHA extensions at 5%.

### S1 key composition (weight 1)

`x86-64-v4` build,
 medians of five runs, GiB/s:

- `fp`, fingerprint material of 70 to 242 bytes:
   `xxhash-rust` 11.47,
   `rscrypto` 11.31,
   `twox-hash` 10.77,
   `hashcrew` 6.29,
   `highway` 3.81,
   SHA-1 1.83,
   SHA-256 1.46 to 1.71,
   BLAKE3 0.85,
   AES-CMAC 0.83,
   AES-PMAC 0.59.
- `keymat`, per-package key material of 50 bytes to 50 KiB:
   `xxhash-rust` 64.80,
   `rscrypto` 60.63,
   `twox-hash` 59.63,
   `hashcrew` 56.43,
   `highway` 14.26,
   AES-PMAC 4.97,
   SHA-1 2.39.

Geometric means against the best finalist:
 `xxhash-rust` 1.000,
 `rscrypto` 1.000 (its five-run ranges overlap `xxhash-rust`'s in both cells),
 `twox-hash` 0.929,
 `hashcrew` 0.691,
 `highway` 0.270.
Ratings 4, 4, 4, 2, 1.
`hashcrew`'s cost is in its short-input path.
Every XXH3 implementation handles inputs up to 240 bytes with scalar code and no kernel dispatch
 (`hashcrew` in `src/xxhash/xxh3.rs:190-196`),
 so the `fp` workload compares those scalar paths,
 and `hashcrew`'s runs at about half the speed of `xxhash-rust`'s.
This audit did not profile which part of that path costs the difference.

### S12 throughput on the non-blocking x86-64 builds (weight 1)

The same three workloads on the baseline, `x86-64-v2`, and `x86-64-v3` builds,
 medians of five runs, ratios against the best finalist in each cell
 (`scripts/s12-ratios.ts`):

- Baseline build, `files`:
   `twox-hash` 48.78,
   `rscrypto` 48.24,
   `xxhash-rust` 34.23,
   `hashcrew` 20.29,
   `highway` 15.06 GiB/s.
- `x86-64-v2`, `files`:
   `rscrypto` 48.08 best,
   `twox-hash` within band,
   `xxhash-rust` 0.656,
   `hashcrew` 0.336 of it.
- `x86-64-v3`, `files`:
   `xxhash-rust` 50.48 best,
   with `twox-hash`, `hashcrew`, and `rscrypto` between 0.94 and 0.99.

Geometric means over the nine cells:
 `twox-hash` 0.973 (rating 4),
 `rscrypto` 0.959 (4),
 `xxhash-rust` 0.747 (3),
 `hashcrew` 0.509 (2),
 `highway` 0.286 (1).

The split is dispatch style.
`twox-hash` and `rscrypto` detect AVX2 at run time,
 so they keep their speed on a build that enables nothing above the x86-64 baseline.
`xxhash-rust` selects at compile time,
 so the baseline and `x86-64-v2` builds run its SSE2 kernel.
`hashcrew` is the interesting case.
The `backend` probe
 (`lab/src/bin/backend.rs`, run in each build)
 reports `selected_backend=Avx2` in every build,
 baseline included,
 so its deficit is not backend choice.
What changes is the code around the annotated kernel:
 in the baseline and `x86-64-v2` builds only the `#[target_feature(enable = "avx2")]` function is compiled with AVX2,
 and those builds measure 0.400 and 0.336 of the best finalist,
 against 0.981 in the `x86-64-v3` build,
 where the whole crate is compiled with AVX2.
The same probe records that no build enables the SHA or AES features at compile time,
 while all of them are detected at run time on this host.

### S3 multi-GB from disk (weight 5)

`x86-64-v4` build,
 single-threaded streaming with 1 MiB reads,
 five repetitions per file, cache mode, and function,
 180 runs, every one parsed
 (`scripts/bench-b.ts`, `data/bench/bigfile.jsonl`, `data/bench-b-summary.txt`).
The read-only pass runs in the same rotation as a ceiling.
Each function produced one digest per file across every mode and repetition
 (18 file-function pairs, all stable),
 and peak resident memory stayed near 3.5 MB for every function,
 which is the bounded-memory half of HC10 measured on a 3.97 GB input.

- 662,710,296-byte debug binary, page cache cold:
   read-only 1.583,
   `xxhash-rust` 1.586,
   `rscrypto` 1.561,
   `hashcrew` 1.546,
   AES-PMAC 1.529,
   `blake3` 1.514,
   `twox-hash` 1.496,
   `highway` 1.467,
   SHA-256 1.367 GiB/s.
  Every finalist overlaps the read-only pass;
   only SHA-256 falls below it (ratio 0.862).
- 662,710,296-byte debug binary, page cache warm:
   read-only 19.777,
   `hashcrew` 15.360,
   `twox-hash` 15.037,
   `xxhash-rust` 14.740,
   `rscrypto` 13.818,
   `highway` 8.606,
   `blake3` 5.446,
   AES-PMAC 4.905,
   SHA-256 2.032 GiB/s.
  The four XXH3 crates overlap each other;
   `highway` resolves at 0.560,
   `blake3` at 0.355,
   AES-PMAC at 0.319,
   SHA-256 at 0.132.
- 3,966,238,720-byte image, cold:
   0.316 to 0.351 GiB/s for everything including the read-only pass,
   all overlapping.
  Storage bounds this cell completely.
- 3,966,238,720-byte image, warm:
   read-only 16.424,
   `xxhash-rust` 13.627,
   `hashcrew` 13.282,
   `twox-hash` 13.149 (0.965),
   `rscrypto` 12.194 (0.895),
   `highway` 8.087 (0.593),
   `blake3` 5.377 (0.395),
   AES-PMAC 4.594 (0.337),
   SHA-256 2.000 (0.147).

Geometric means over the four cells:
 `xxhash-rust` 1.000,
 `hashcrew` 1.000,
 `twox-hash` 0.991,
 `rscrypto` 0.973,
 all rating 4;
 `highway` 0.759, rating 3;
 `blake3` 0.612 and AES-PMAC 0.573, rating 2;
 SHA-256 0.360, rating 1.
The cold cells tie almost everything,
 so S3's separating power comes from the warm cells,
 where the page cache is the source and the hash is the bottleneck.

### S4 multi-core hashing of one large input (weight 1)

The one campaign that raises the container bounds:
 `--cpus` set to the thread count, at most 8 of the host's 16 logical cores,
 with `--memory=8g`,
 three repetitions,
 warm page cache,
 the 3.97 GB image,
 16 MiB reads
 (`scripts/scaling.ts`, `data/bench/scaling.jsonl`).

- `blake3`'s library parallel mode (`Hasher::update_rayon`):
   3.96 GiB/s at one thread,
   5.87 at two,
   7.63 at four,
   8.48 at eight,
   a self-speedup of 2.14 at eight threads,
   with the same digest at every thread count.
- A lab-defined chunk composition
   (fixed-size chunks hashed in parallel, then their digests hashed in order):
   BLAKE3 6.88 and XXH3-128 7.31 GiB/s at eight threads.
  Its output differs from the sequential digest by construction,
   so it is a format meow would own rather than a library mode.
- Single-threaded XXH3-128 on the same file and cache state:
   13.35 GiB/s,
   above every parallel BLAKE3 configuration measured here.

Ratings:
 every XXH3-128 finalist and `highway` rate 1,
 because none offers a library parallel mode whose output equals its sequential output,
 and a chunk construction would be meow's own format.
`blake3` would rate 3 on this criterion
 (a library mode with a 2.14 self-speedup),
 which is one of the few places a cryptographic candidate scores above the finalists,
 and at weight 1 it does not move the ranking.

One limit of this campaign:
 the harness routed every multi-thread run of `rscrypto_blake3_128` through the lab composition
 rather than through `rscrypto`'s own rayon tree mode,
 so its parallel feature was measured only at one thread (4.21 GiB/s).
Its published CI artifacts show that mode at about six times its single-thread speed on an 8-vCPU runner
 ("S5: aarch64 evidence"),
 which would place it near `blake3`'s `update_rayon`.
No finalist rating depends on this,
 because no XXH3-128 candidate has such a mode.

## S5: aarch64 evidence

S5 is measured.
All five finalists ran on one aarch64 core,
 an Apple M1,
 on 2026-09-17 after the user powered the machine on for this measurement
 ("The `ssh m1` run").
The borrowed numbers the first version of this report rated S5 from are kept as superseded evidence
 ("Measured aarch64 numbers from rscrypto's public CI", "aarch64 kernels by candidate"),
 and they now serve as corroboration from a second aarch64 core rather than as the rating's basis.

The measured core is `aarch64-apple-darwin` on an Apple Firestorm performance core,
 not one of the release-blocking `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` and static-pie musl targets,
 so what it measures is each crate's aarch64 NEON path on real hardware,
 not the release-blocking targets themselves
 ("Confidence and limits").

### Measured on an Apple M1

Host and discipline:
 "Execution manifest", aarch64 measurement host.
Workloads,
 corpus,
 harness,
 rounds,
 and run count are the ones the `x86-64-v4` campaign used,
 on the identical corpus bytes
 (`data/files.bin`, 8,101 files, 152,231,070 bytes,
 SHA-256 `3d4a2f8f407e3dbc6e42e2ca4603f96a07ced3a121174a964492a43ff38df075` on both machines).

Two builds ran,
 five runs of two rounds each per build and workload,
 50 runs in all
 (`scripts/m1-bench.ts`, `m1/bench/`, `m1/bench-summary.tsv`, `m1/bench-progress.txt`):

- `m1-generic`:
   `-Ctarget-cpu=generic`,
   which compiles `neon` and nothing above the aarch64 baseline.
  This is the build the S5 rating uses,
   because the release-blocking aarch64 Linux targets enable `neon` only and leave
   `aes`, `pmull`, `sha2`, `sha3`, and `crc` to run-time detection ("Context", target features).
- `m1-native`:
   the machine default for `aarch64-apple-darwin`,
   which compiles `aes`, `sha2`, `sha3`, `crc`, and `dotprod` as well
   (`lab/src/bin/backend.rs`, `m1/logs/`).

Run-to-run band,
 measured first on the unchanged build before anything is compared:
 on `m1-generic` the median cell spans 0.3% between its slowest and fastest run,
 the 90th percentile 1.9%,
 the widest 2.5%;
 on `m1-native` 1.9%, 3.1%, and 22.8%
 (the widest is the `gxhash` control on `files`).
The widest finalist bands are `twox-hash` on `files-stream64k` at 5.7% on `m1-native`
 and `rscrypto` on `fp` at 1.7% on `m1-generic`.
This machine is quieter than the x86 host,
 whose median cell spans 1.9% and whose 90th percentile is 5.4% ("Run-to-run band").

`m1-generic`,
 medians of five runs, GiB/s, with the five-run range:

- `files`, one call per tracked file:
   `hashcrew` 30.910 [30.845, 30.926],
   `twox-hash` 30.728 [30.698, 30.741],
   `xxhash-rust` 29.859 [29.824, 29.886],
   `rscrypto` 29.736 [29.703, 29.762],
   (`museair` control 23.972),
   `highway` 7.172 [7.167, 7.256],
   AES-PMAC 3.937,
   SHA-256 2.142 through `sha2`,
   `blake3` 1.515,
   `rscrypto` BLAKE3 1.454.
- `files-stream64k`, a streaming hasher per file fed 64 KiB slices:
   `hashcrew` 28.220 [28.171, 28.254],
   `twox-hash` 27.508 [27.425, 27.526],
   `rscrypto` 23.755 [23.715, 23.785],
   `xxhash-rust` 21.273 [21.236, 21.279],
   `highway` 7.107,
   AES-PMAC 3.904,
   SHA-256 2.131,
   `blake3` 1.473.
- `hot16k`, one cache-resident 16 KiB buffer:
   `hashcrew` 32.952,
   `twox-hash` 32.807,
   `xxhash-rust` 31.923,
   `rscrypto` 31.818,
   (`museair` control 25.179),
   `highway` 7.233.

Geometric means of the three cells against the best finalist in each,
 with the frozen overlap rule applied
 (`scripts/m1-ratios.ts`):
 `hashcrew` 1.000,
 `twox-hash` 0.988,
 `rscrypto` 0.921,
 `xxhash-rust` 0.890,
 `highway` 0.234.
Ratings 4, 4, 4, 3, 0.

`m1-native` gives the same five ratings from the same procedure:
 `hashcrew` 1.000,
 `twox-hash` 0.997,
 `rscrypto` 0.901,
 `xxhash-rust` 0.873,
 `highway` 0.229.
The fastest candidate in every cell is also the fastest finalist,
 so the S5 rule's "fastest candidate on the same aarch64 core" and the S2 rule's "best finalist"
 pick the same denominator here.

Which cells S5 uses:
 the three in-memory cells S2 defines,
 `files`, `files-stream64k`, and `hot16k`,
 because S5 rates "in-memory whole-file and large-stream speed"
 and S2 is where this report operationalizes that phrase
 ("Frozen soft criteria").
One rating is sensitive to that choice and is disclosed rather than tuned:
 dropping `hot16k` and rating from the two file-shaped cells alone gives
 `hashcrew` 1.000,
 `twox-hash` 0.984,
 `rscrypto` 0.900,
 `xxhash-rust` 0.853,
 `highway` 0.242 on `m1-generic`,
 which moves `rscrypto` from 4 to 3 and leaves the other four ratings unchanged.
The consequence of that one step is already in the sensitivity matrix,
 because `rscrypto`'s S5 rating is medium confidence and the frozen procedure steps it:
 it puts `hashcrew` 85.9 ahead of `rscrypto` 85.3 for second place,
 with `twox-hash` still first
 ("Sensitivity").
The three-cell set was fixed by S2 before any aarch64 number existed,
 so it is not chosen by its result.

Two things this measurement settles that no published number did:

- `twox-hash` is at the top of the field on an aarch64 core measured here,
   within 0.6% of `hashcrew` on whole files and within 2.6% on the streaming workload.
- `hashcrew` and `highway`,
   which had no published aarch64 throughput anywhere,
   now have five-run medians:
   `hashcrew` at the top,
   `highway` at 0.23 of it,
   which is below its x86 ratio of 0.28 and below the 0.25 threshold for a rating of 1.

### The one large change from the x86 ordering

`xxhash-rust` is fastest of the five on `files-stream64k` on the `x86-64-v4` build
 (44.38 GiB/s, "S2 whole files, KiB to tens of MiB (weight 5)")
 and slowest of the five on the same workload on the Apple M1
 (21.273 against `hashcrew`'s 28.220).
Its one-shot `files` number on the M1 is 29.859,
 so its streaming path there runs at 0.71 of its own one-shot,
 against 0.94 on `x86-64-v4`.
This single cell is what moves its S5 rating from 4 to 3.

What the source shows:
 `xxhash-rust`'s streaming state re-enters its block-boundary routine every 256 bytes.
`INTERNAL_BUFFER_SIZE` is 256 (`src/xxh3.rs:853`),
 `INTERNAL_BUFFER_STRIPES` is therefore 4 (`src/xxh3.rs:886`),
 and the bulk loop calls `xxh3_stateful_consume_stripes` for four stripes at a time,
 advancing the input pointer by 256 bytes per call (`src/xxh3.rs:915-925`).
`twox-hash` instead iterates stripes directly over the whole in-place run once its buffer is empty
 (`src/xxhash3/streaming.rs:255-271`).
The same two structures compile on both architectures,
 so the difference in cost between them is not a dispatch difference;
 this audit did not profile which part of the path accounts for it,
 and states the structure rather than a cause.

### Key composition on aarch64

S1 is frozen to the `x86-64-v4` build ("Frozen soft criteria"),
 so these numbers change no rating.
They are recorded because they were measured and because they corroborate the S1 ordering.
`m1-generic`, medians of five runs, GiB/s:

- `fp`, fingerprint material of 70 to 242 bytes:
   `xxhash-rust` 9.616,
   `rscrypto` 8.601,
   `twox-hash` 8.506,
   `hashcrew` 5.039,
   `highway` 2.592.
- `keymat`, per-package key material of 50 bytes to 50 KiB:
   `twox-hash` 31.387,
   `hashcrew` 31.380,
   `xxhash-rust` 31.068,
   `rscrypto` 30.063,
   `highway` 7.021.

Geometric means against the best finalist:
 `xxhash-rust` 0.995,
 `twox-hash` 0.941,
 `rscrypto` 0.926,
 `hashcrew` 0.724,
 `highway` 0.246,
 which would map to 4, 4, 4, 3, 0.
The x86 S1 means are 1.000, 0.929, 1.000, 0.691, 0.270.
Both architectures put `xxhash-rust` first,
 `twox-hash` and `rscrypto` close behind,
 and `hashcrew` at about 0.7 because of its short-input scalar path.

### Positive control for the build comparison

The two builds give the five finalists the same ratings,
 which is a null result,
 so the harness is shown able to resolve a build difference in the same cells
 (`AGENTS.md` rule `QPC`).
On `files` it resolves these,
 `m1-generic` against `m1-native`:

- `cryptoxide` SHA-256:
   0.205 against 2.006 GiB/s,
   a factor of 9.8.
- `scytale` SHA-256:
   0.280 against 2.235,
   a factor of 8.0.
- AES-PMAC:
   3.937 against 4.858.

Those three select the Armv8 SHA-2 and AES extensions at compile time,
 so the baseline build cannot reach them,
 which is the same compile-time-selection effect the x86 builds show for `cryptoxide`
 ("Execution manifest").
In the same cells the five finalists move by at most 5%,
 so the harness looked,
 and the finalists' NEON paths really are build independent here.

Absolute speeds are not comparable between the two builds:
 the `m1-native` runs went first,
 while the machine had more of the user's own load,
 and the `m1-generic` runs are faster for almost every function for that reason.
Only the within-build ratios feed a rating.

### Thermal and load state

The machine is a fanless `MacBookAir10,1`,
 so a long campaign could throttle and make later runs slower.
It did not:

- `pmset -g therm` ran before and after all 50 runs,
   100 probes,
   and reported "No thermal warning level has been recorded" and
   "No performance warning level has been recorded" every time,
   with no `CPU_Speed_Limit` line in any of them
   (`m1/bench-progress.txt`).
- Swap in use was 0.00M at all 100 probes.
- On `files`, the five `m1-generic` runs,
   which came last in the campaign,
   agree within 0.3% for every finalist
   (`hashcrew` 30.92, 30.85, 30.93, 30.91, 30.84 GiB/s across runs 1 to 5).
  The earlier `m1-native` runs drift by up to 4.6%
   (`hashcrew` 31.18, 31.15, 29.75, 30.04, 30.38),
   downward and then partly back up,
   which is the user's own load rather than a thermal ramp:
   a thermal ramp would not let the later build run faster and flatter than the earlier one.
- Load averages recorded before and after each run range from 1.21 to 10.85 on this 8-core machine;
   the machine was in use by its owner throughout.

### Measured aarch64 numbers from rscrypto's public CI

Superseded as the basis for `xxhash-rust`'s and `rscrypto`'s S5 ratings,
 kept as corroboration from a second aarch64 core of a different microarchitecture.

`rscrypto` publishes criterion artifacts from its benchmark workflow.
Run 34874736834 of 2026-09-14 was downloaded and parsed
 (`scripts/rscrypto-bench-extract.ts`, `data/rscrypto-bench.tsv`, 5,038 rows).
The aarch64 measurement runner is `measure-aarch64-linux`,
 an on-demand AWS `c9g.2xlarge` with 8 vCPUs
 (`.github/runs-on.yml` at `main` in the rscrypto clone);
 the artifacts do not record the CPU model beyond that.
The comparison crates in that run are the versions this vet measures:
 `xxhash-rust` 0.8.18,
 `sha2` 0.11.0,
 and `blake3` 1.8.6 (this vet uses 1.8.7).

Single-message throughput on aarch64, 1 MiB inputs:

- XXH3-128:
   `xxhash-rust` 24.59 GiB/s,
   `rscrypto` 24.53 GiB/s;
   at 64 KiB both are 24.56;
   at 4 KiB `rscrypto` 24.37 and `xxhash-rust` 23.28.
  The two are the same algorithm with separate NEON kernels and land within a percent of each other.
  The Apple M1 one-shot `files` numbers put the same pair within 0.4% of each other
   (29.859 and 29.736),
   so the one-shot parity of these two crates holds on both aarch64 cores measured.
- SHA-256:
   `sha2` 1.687,
   `rscrypto` 1.687,
   `ring` and `aws-lc-rs` 1.957.
- SHA-512:
   `ring` and `aws-lc-rs` 1.185,
   `rscrypto` 1.155,
   `sha2` 1.143.
- SHA-3 and SHAKE through `keccak`-class code:
   0.43 to 0.96,
   which bounds KangarooTwelve on aarch64 in the same region.
- BLAKE3:
   the `blake3` crate 1.613,
   `rscrypto` 13.31.
  These two rows are not comparable as kernels:
   the benchmark binary for the BLAKE3 group is built with the features
   `["std", "blake3", "parallel"]`
   (`.config/benchmark-matrix.json` at `main`),
   so `rscrypto::Blake3::digest` runs its rayon tree mode across the runner's 8 vCPUs
   while `blake3::hash` is single-threaded.
  The same pattern appears in the x86 artifacts from the same run
   (`blake3` 10.21, `rscrypto` 61.75 GiB/s),
   where the ratio is again about the vCPU count.
  Read as single-core evidence,
   the usable number from this source is the `blake3` crate's 1.61 GiB/s on aarch64.

So on aarch64, as on `x86-64-v4`,
 XXH3-128 runs about 15 times the speed of the fastest cryptographic candidate.
The Apple M1 measurement agrees:
 XXH3-128 at 29.7 to 30.9 GiB/s on whole files against SHA-256 at 2.142 with the Armv8 SHA-2 extension,
 `blake3` at 1.515,
 and AES-PMAC at 3.937,
 a factor of 8 to 20.

### aarch64 kernels by candidate

Read in source,
 and now paired with the measured number for each crate:

- `xxhash-rust`:
   NEON stripe accumulator under `cfg(target_feature = "neon")`,
   which every `aarch64-unknown-linux-*` target enables
   (`src/xxh3.rs:55`, `:252-268`).
  Measured: 29.859 GiB/s one-shot, 21.273 streaming.
- `twox-hash`:
   NEON accumulate and scramble kernels (`src/xxhash3/large/neon.rs`),
   selected at run time.
  Measured: 30.728 one-shot, 27.508 streaming.
  Superseded evidence:
   upstream's Apple M1 Max comparison
   (`comparison/README.md`, "xxHash3 (128-bit)", "Oneshot hashing"):
   Rust 34.4 GiB/s,
   C with NEON 34.6,
   C scalar 21.3,
   for 256 KiB to 4 MiB buffers.
  That table rated S5 at 4 in the first version of this report;
   it is now corroboration only,
   and the local measurement agrees with its shape,
   parity with the C NEON reference,
   on a smaller M1 and a different workload mix.
- `hashcrew`:
   NEON kernels (`src/xxhash/kernel/neon.rs`),
   selected at compile time because aarch64 enables NEON
   (`src/xxhash/kernel/mod.rs:98-104`),
   so the run-time dispatch it pays on x86_64 does not apply there.
  The `backend` probe confirms it on both m1 builds:
   `selected_backend=Neon`
   (`m1/logs/`).
  Measured: 30.910 one-shot, 28.220 streaming, the fastest finalist in every S5 cell.
- `rscrypto`:
   NEON kernel in `src/hashes/fast/xxh3/aarch64_neon.rs` with run-time detection in `src/platform/detect`.
  Measured: 29.736 one-shot, 23.755 streaming.
- `highway`:
   a NEON implementation of the four-lane update with `vmull_u32` multiplies (`src/aarch64.rs`),
   used unconditionally on aarch64.
  The README claims "> 10 GB/s with SIMD (SSE 4.1 AVX 2, NEON)" without naming a machine or input size;
   `assets/highway.csv` holds x86 results only.
  Measured: 7.172 one-shot, 7.107 streaming, 7.233 on the hot buffer,
   so on this core it stays between 6.9 and 7.3 GiB/s whatever the workload,
   and it sits at 0.23 of XXH3-128 there.
- Cryptographic candidates:
   `sha2`, `rscrypto`, `graviola`, `purecrypto`, `bitcoin_hashes`, and `scytale` use the Armv8 SHA-2 extension;
   `sha2` and `rscrypto` use the Armv8.2 SHA-512 instructions;
   `aes` uses the Armv8 AES extension;
   `keccak` uses the Armv8.2 SHA-3 extension;
   `cubehash` and `xoodyak` use NEON.
  Measured on `m1-generic`, `files`:
   SHA-256 at 2.043 to 2.142 GiB/s,
   SHA-512 at 1.338 to 1.339,
   `graviola` SHA-512 at 0.467,
   CubeHash at 0.394,
   Xoodyak at 0.124,
   and `purecrypto` SHA-256 at 1.298.
  `cryptoxide` and `scytale` reach 0.205 and 0.280 on that build because they select the SHA-2
   extension at compile time,
   and 2.006 and 2.235 on `m1-native` where the build enables it.
  Every cryptographic candidate is an order of magnitude under XXH3-128 on the same core,
   as the published numbers had indicated.

## Quality and stability assurance

### SMHasher3 (S6 evidence)

The SMHasher3 results summary saved by the prior vet
 (`~/temp/agent/hashvet-2026-09-17/data/smhasher3-results-readme.md`)
 and the raw result files it saved for the two non-cryptographic finalist families:

- `XXH3-128`:
   in the "Failing hashes" table with 36 failures out of 250 tests.
  The raw file (`smh3-XXH3-128.txt`) shows the failures are in reduced-width and distribution tests;
   every "all collisions (128-bit)" line reports 0 actual against 0.0 expected,
   so no full-width collision appears at any tested seed.
  The `.regen` variant has 19 failures with the same pattern.
- `HighwayHash-128`:
   in the "Passing hashes" table,
   238 tests, no failures.
- Cryptographic families:
   `blake3`, `SHA-2-224`, `SHA-2-256`, `SHA-1`, `blake2s`, `blake2b`, `MD5`, `SHA-3`, and the Ascon CXOFs
   are all in the passing table.
  The AES-based non-cryptographic entries fail
   (`aesnihash-peterrk` 41, `aesnihash-majek` 64, `t1ha0.aesA` and `t1ha0.aesB` 5 each),
   which is why an AES-round universal hash would have needed its own quality evidence rather than AES's.

Crafted collisions,
 which the changed premises make a scored question rather than a gate:

- XXH3-128 and HighwayHash-128 make no collision-resistance claim once the seed or key is known.
  For meow's cache the seed is a constant in the binary,
   so an adversary who can run code in the repository can craft a pair of file contents with the same key.
  The user's accepted reasoning is that such an adversary already runs meow's tasks,
   and that the cache is local and rebuildable.
- BLAKE3, SHA-256, SHA-512, KangarooTwelve, CubeHash, and Xoodyak have no published collision attack,
   and a 128-bit truncation of any of them costs the generic 2^64 to collide.
- SHA-1 truncated to 128 bits inherits the published SHA-1 collision attacks,
   which are below that generic cost.
- AES-CMAC and AES-PMAC with a key that ships in the binary are not collision-resistant at all:
   their security argument assumes a secret key.

### Stability assurance (S7 evidence)

- Local reference equality:
   `lab/src/bin/refcheck.rs` checks published digests
   (FIPS 180-4 SHA-256, SHA-1, and SHA-512 of `"abc"`,
   the BLAKE3 hash of the empty input,
   and XXH3-128 of the empty input)
   and cross-implementation equality inside each family
   (four XXH3-128 crates, seven SHA-256 crates, three SHA-512 crates, two BLAKE3 crates)
   over 266 input lengths from 0 to 1 MiB,
   with a positive control that flips one input byte and must fail every check.
- Cross-architecture equality:
   the prior vet's QEMU aarch64 runs and its `x86-64-v3` musl probe showed the NEON and x86 paths agreeing
   for the four reused finalists;
   this vet adds the `x86-64-v4` build and the aarch64 suites for `rscrypto`.
- Upstream vectors:
   every candidate's own test suite carries the published vectors of its algorithm,
   and the upstream suites that ran here executed them ("Upstream suites").
- Documentation:
   the XXH3 specification freeze,
   FIPS 180-4,
   NIST SP 800-38B,
   the BLAKE3, KangarooTwelve, CubeHash, and Xoodyak specifications,
   and `rscrypto`'s statement that its SIMD and assembly kernels are tested against its portable reference path.

## Source quality, dependencies, and maintenance

### Audit surface (S9 evidence)

Non-test Rust code lines on the path that computes the used function,
 counted over the modules that implement it
 (`scripts/audit-surface.ts`, `data/audit-surface.tsv`):

- `xxhash-rust` XXH3-128: 1,396 lines in 3 files.
- `hashcrew` XXH3-128: 1,511 lines in 6 files.
- `twox-hash` XXH3-128: 1,533 lines in 8 files.
- `highway` HighwayHash-128: 2,955 lines in 16 files.
- `rscrypto` XXH3-128: 7,496 lines in 23 files,
   which includes its platform detection module
   and kernels meow never compiles
   (s390x 329 lines, PowerPC 290);
   its x86_64 and aarch64 kernels are 225, 210, and 279 lines,
   its streaming state 594,
   and its dispatch 406 plus 68 lines of tables.
  Most of its `unsafe` blocks on that path carry a `SAFETY` comment
   (for example 11 of 19 occurrences in `x86_64_avx2.rs`, 13 of 22 in `aarch64_neon.rs`,
   counting every occurrence of the word, including the `unsafe fn` signatures).
- For scale, the cryptographic candidates on the same measure:
   `sha2` SHA-256 985 lines,
   `graviola` SHA-256 446,
   `sha1` 806,
   `blake3` 6,224 plus 26 C and assembly files,
   `rscrypto` BLAKE3 18,280 Rust lines plus 20,286 assembly lines.

Whole-crate figures,
 `unsafe` items,
 and native files are in "Identity, provenance, and license".
The contrast that matters for a weight-1 criterion:
 `xxhash-rust`, `hashcrew`, and `twox-hash` are single-purpose crates of a few thousand lines,
 `highway` is one algorithm with four architecture backends,
 and `rscrypto` is a 177,154-line cryptography suite of which the XXH3 path is a small part,
 so auditing its XXH3 means auditing a module inside a much larger crate
 whose other parts compile into the same library.

Runtime dependencies of the finalists:

- `xxhash-rust`, `hashcrew`, `highway`: none.
- `twox-hash`: `rand` and `serde`, both optional and off by default.
- `rscrypto`: `getrandom`, `rayon`, and `serde`, all optional;
   the hash paths need none of them,
   and `rayon` is what its `parallel` feature turns on.

### Maintenance (S11 evidence)

From the crates.io API and the GitHub API on 2026-09-17
 (`data/crate-meta.tsv`, `data/repo-meta.tsv`):

- `xxhash-rust` 0.8.18,
   published 2026-07-21,
   15 stable releases since 2021-03-08,
   3 in the last year,
   29.6M recent downloads,
   3 open issues,
   last commit 2026-07-21.
- `twox-hash` 2.1.4,
   published 2026-08-27,
   22 stable releases since 2015-05-09,
   2 in the last year,
   53.4M recent downloads,
   25 open issues,
   last commit 2026-09-17.
- `hashcrew` 0.3.0,
   published 2026-09-15,
   5 stable releases,
   all since 2026-09-02,
   202 recent downloads,
   0 open issues,
   4 stars,
   last commit 2026-09-15.
- `highway` 1.3.0,
   published 2025-01-11,
   21 stable releases since 2018-09-19,
   none in the last year,
   702K recent downloads,
   6 open issues,
   last commit 2026-07-23.
- `rscrypto` 0.9.0,
   published 2026-08-28,
   16 stable releases,
   all since 2026-05-02,
   1,108 recent downloads,
   0 open issues,
   38 stars,
   last commit 2026-09-17,
   and six CI workflows (`ci.yml`, `bench.yml`, `ct.yml`, `fuzz.yml`, `profile.yml`, `release.yml`).

Two of the five are young crates with almost no dependent base
 (`hashcrew` two weeks old, `rscrypto` four months old),
 two are long-lived with millions of downloads,
 and `highway` is stable but quiet:
 no release in the last year,
 while its repository still receives commits.

## C toolchain branch

The branch asks whether allowing a C compiler and assembler in meow's build
 (HC4-C in "Frozen hard constraints")
 could change the ranking.
Only one candidate is affected:
 `blake3` 1.8.7,
 whose AVX-512 and NEON kernels are C and assembly compiled by `cc`.
Every other HC4 exit is an FFI wrapper around a C library
 (`ring`, `aws-lc-rs`, `openssl`, the `*-asm` crates, `kangarootwelve_xkcp`, and the rest),
 and each wraps an algorithm that a Rust candidate already implements here,
 so their speed is bounded by the same algorithms' measurements.

Measured, `x86-64-v4` build, medians of five runs, GiB/s
 (`data/bench-a-summary.tsv`):

- `blake3` with its C and assembly kernels:
   `files` 4.64,
   `files-stream64k` 4.48,
   `hot16k` 7.53.
- `blake3` with the `pure` feature, Rust kernels only:
   `files` 3.79,
   `files-stream64k` 3.70,
   `hot16k` 6.40.
  So the C kernels buy it 18% to 22% on this host.
- `rscrypto` BLAKE3, pure Rust with `global_asm!` kernels rustc assembles:
   `files` 4.33,
   `files-stream64k` 4.46,
   `hot16k` 7.42,
   within a few percent of `blake3` with C,
   and faster than `blake3` without it.
- On the baseline build the gap is larger
   (`blake3` with C 4.31 against `pure` 3.07),
   because the C build selects AVX-512 at run time while the Rust `pure` build has AVX2 at most.

Decision:
 the branch closes,
 and no user question is raised.
The reason is a measured bound rather than a preference:
 BLAKE3 with its C kernels reaches 0.097 of XXH3-128's throughput on whole files
 and 0.10 on the streaming and hot-buffer workloads,
 which is rating 0 on S2,
 and its measured aarch64 single-thread speed is 1.61 GiB/s against XXH3-128's 24.5
 ("S5: aarch64 evidence"),
 which is rating 0 on S5.
By the bound in "Which confirmed candidates receive equal-depth validation",
 a candidate rated 0 on S2 and S5 cannot pass 42 of 92 points,
 while every XXH3-128 candidate scores at least 45 from the weight-5 criteria alone.
Allowing C would also not improve any other candidate's rank,
 because `rscrypto` already delivers BLAKE3 at C speed without it.

## Scoring

Criteria and weights as frozen in "Frozen soft criteria":
 S1 1,
 S2 5,
 S3 5,
 S4 1,
 S5 5,
 S6 1,
 S7 1,
 S9 1,
 S10 1,
 S11 1,
 S12 1;
 maximum 23 × 4 = 92.
Inputs are in `~/temp/agent/hashvet2-2026-09-17/data/ratings.json`;
 arithmetic and sensitivity by `scripts/score.ts`,
 output `data/score.txt`.
A range uses its midpoint as the provisional rating and both endpoints in the sensitivity matrix.

Ratings, with the evidence each rests on:

- S1 key composition, from the measured geometric means ("S1 key composition (weight 1)"):
   `xxhash-rust` 4 high,
   `rscrypto` 4 high,
   `twox-hash` 4 medium (0.929, within 0.03 of the threshold),
   `hashcrew` 2 medium (0.691),
   `highway` 1 medium (0.270).
- S2 whole files ("S2 whole files, KiB to tens of MiB (weight 5)"):
   `xxhash-rust`, `twox-hash`, `hashcrew`, `rscrypto` 4 high (0.944 to 0.997);
   `highway` 1 high (0.281).
- S3 multi-GB from disk ("S3 multi-GB from disk (weight 5)"):
   `xxhash-rust`, `hashcrew`, `twox-hash`, `rscrypto` 4 high (0.973 to 1.000);
   `highway` 3 high (0.759).
- S4 multi-core ("S4 multi-core hashing of one large input (weight 1)"):
   all five 1 high;
   no XXH3-128 or HighwayHash crate offers a parallel mode whose output equals its sequential output.
- S5 aarch64,
   now measured rather than borrowed
   ("S5: aarch64 evidence"),
   from the geometric means of the `files`, `files-stream64k`, and `hot16k` cells on the `m1-generic` build,
   rated by the same mechanical rule and confidence rule as S1, S2, S3, and S12:
   `hashcrew` 4 high (1.000),
   `twox-hash` 4 high (0.988),
   `rscrypto` 4 medium (0.921, within 0.03 of the threshold),
   `xxhash-rust` 3 medium (0.890),
   `highway` 0 medium (0.234).
  The `m1-native` build yields the same five ratings.
  Superseded inputs,
   kept visible:
   `xxhash-rust` 4 high and `rscrypto` 4 high from rscrypto's public CI on an AWS `c9g.2xlarge`;
   `twox-hash` 4 medium from upstream's Apple M1 Max table;
   `hashcrew` 2 to 4 (midpoint 3) low and `highway` 1 to 3 (midpoint 2) low from source analysis alone.
  The two inputs that changed rating are `xxhash-rust`,
   from 4 to 3 on its streaming cell,
   and `highway`,
   from a midpoint of 2 to a measured 0.
- S6 quality beyond HC8 ("SMHasher3 (S6 evidence)"):
   the four XXH3-128 crates share one rating,
   2 medium,
   for 36 SMHasher3 failures with no full-width collision at any tested seed;
   `highway` 3 medium,
   for 238 of 238 tests passed,
   held below 4 because HighwayHash makes no collision-resistance claim once its key is known.
- S7 stability assurance ("Stability assurance (S7 evidence)"):
   `twox-hash` 4 high (frozen specification, C-comparison property tests per kernel, local equality everywhere);
   `rscrypto` 4 medium (frozen specification, portable reference path stated in its README,
   a differential fuzz target against `xxhash-rust`, kernel tests, and local equality,
   with four months of history);
   `xxhash-rust` 3 medium,
   `hashcrew` 3 medium,
   `highway` 3 medium,
   all as the prior vet rated them.
- S9 auditability ("Audit surface (S9 evidence)"):
   `hashcrew` 4 medium (1,511 lines, no runtime dependencies),
   `twox-hash` 3 medium (1,533 lines),
   `xxhash-rust` 3 medium (1,396 lines, no safety comments),
   `highway` 2 medium (2,955 lines, 207 `unsafe` items),
   `rscrypto` 2 medium (7,496 lines on the used path inside a 177,154-line crate).
- S10 upstream verification ("Upstream suites", "Additional validation"):
   `twox-hash` 4 high,
   `rscrypto` 4 high (cross-target CI, a constant-time engine, a Miri job, a fuzz workflow on two architectures,
   and the 46.8-million-execution differential fuzz run here),
   `xxhash-rust` 3 medium,
   `hashcrew` 3 medium,
   `highway` 3 medium.
- S11 maintenance ("Maintenance (S11 evidence)"):
   `twox-hash` 3 medium,
   `xxhash-rust` 3 medium,
   `rscrypto` 2 to 3 (midpoint 2.5) low
   (16 releases in four months, 112 pull requests all closed quickly, one maintainer plus dependabot,
   no external issue history, 1,108 recent downloads),
   `highway` 2 medium,
   `hashcrew` 1 to 3 (midpoint 2) low.
- S12 non-blocking builds ("S12 throughput on the non-blocking x86-64 builds (weight 1)"):
   `twox-hash` 4 high,
   `rscrypto` 4 high,
   `xxhash-rust` 3 high,
   `hashcrew` 2 high,
   `highway` 1 high.

Totals:

- `twox-hash` 85 of 92 (92.4%).
- `rscrypto` 83.5 (90.8%), range 83 to 84.
- `hashcrew` 79 (85.9%), range 78 to 80.
- `xxhash-rust` 77 (83.7%).
- `highway` 36 (39.1%).

Totals before the aarch64 measurement,
 for comparison
 (`data/ratings-before-m1.json`, `data/score-before-m1.txt`):
 `twox-hash` 85,
 `rscrypto` 83.5,
 `xxhash-rust` 82,
 `hashcrew` 74,
 `highway` 46.
The measurement left the top two totals unchanged,
 raised `hashcrew` by 5 points,
 lowered `xxhash-rust` by 5,
 and lowered `highway` by 10.

## Sensitivity

96 one-at-a-time tests
 (`data/score.txt`):
 each weight-1 criterion raised to 2, 3, 4, and 5;
 S2, S3, and S5 lowered to 4, 3, 2, and 1;
 S5 raised to 10 as the defined extra test;
 every medium-confidence exact rating moved one step down and up;
 both endpoints of every low-signal range.
The count fell from 97 because the aarch64 measurement replaced two low-signal S5 ranges
 and two medium-confidence S5 ratings with measured ones,
 which generates fewer step tests.

No test changes the winner.
Seventeen change the order below first place or produce a tie:

- `rating rscrypto.S5 4->3`:
   `twox-hash` 92.4 > `hashcrew` 85.9 > `rscrypto` 85.3 > `xxhash-rust` 83.7 > `highway` 39.1.
- `rating xxhash-rust.S5 3->4`:
   `twox-hash` 92.4 > `rscrypto` 90.8 > `xxhash-rust` 89.1 > `hashcrew` 85.9 > `highway` 39.1.
- `weight S9=4` and `S9=5`:
   `hashcrew` moves ahead of `rscrypto` into second place;
   `twox-hash` stays first.
- `weight S1=2` through `S1=5`,
   `weight S11=3` through `S11=5`,
   `weight S12=3` through `S12=5`,
   and `weight S5=3`, `S5=2`, `S5=1`:
   `xxhash-rust` moves ahead of `hashcrew` into third place,
   with an exact tie at `S1=2`, `S11=3`, `S12=3`, and `S5=3`.

Closest margins:

- `twox-hash` over `rscrypto`:
   `rating twox-hash.S1 4->3`,
   which still leaves `twox-hash` ahead by 0.50 points on the 92-point scale.
- `rscrypto` over `hashcrew`:
   `weight S9=5`, which reverses the pair by 2.98 points.
- `hashcrew` over `xxhash-rust`:
   `weight S1=5`, which reverses the pair by 5.11 points.
- `xxhash-rust` over `highway`:
   `weight S6=5`, which still leaves `xxhash-rust` ahead by 31.52 points.

Winners across all 96 tests:
 `twox-hash` alone.
Before the aarch64 measurement the winners were `twox-hash` and `rscrypto`,
 because `rating twox-hash.S5 4->3` reversed the top pair
 (`data/score-before-m1.txt`).
That test no longer exists:
 `twox-hash`'s S5 rating is now measured at 0.988 of the fastest finalist on the measured core,
 far enough from the 0.90 threshold to be high confidence,
 and the frozen procedure steps only medium-confidence and low-confidence ratings.

### Extra defined test: transfer between aarch64 cores

The frozen matrix no longer steps `twox-hash`'s or `hashcrew`'s S5 rating,
 so it does not by itself answer what a transfer error between the measured Apple Firestorm core
 and a release-blocking Linux aarch64 core would do.
One extra test outside the frozen matrix answers it
 (`scripts/score-extra.ts`):

- `twox-hash.S5` stepped to 3:
   `rscrypto` 90.8 > `twox-hash` 87.0 > `hashcrew` 85.9 > `xxhash-rust` 83.7 > `highway` 39.1.
  The top pair reverses.
- `twox-hash.S5` stepped to 2:
   `rscrypto` 90.8 > `hashcrew` 85.9 > `xxhash-rust` 83.7 > `twox-hash` 81.5 > `highway` 39.1.
- `hashcrew.S5` stepped to 3:
   `twox-hash` 92.4 > `rscrypto` 90.8 > `xxhash-rust` 83.7 > `hashcrew` 80.4 > `highway` 39.1.
  The winner is unchanged.

So the structural fragility of the top pair did not go away;
 what changed is what it now rests on.
Reversing it needs `twox-hash`'s true aarch64 ratio on a release-blocking core to fall below 0.90,
 that is a relative regression of more than 9% against the fastest finalist on that core,
 where the measured Apple M1 figure is 0.988 and upstream's Apple M1 Max table puts it at parity
 with the C NEON reference.
The one aarch64 pairing with numbers from two different cores,
 `xxhash-rust` against `rscrypto`,
 holds its one-shot relation on both
 (24.59 against 24.53 on an AWS `c9g.2xlarge`,
 29.859 against 29.736 on the Apple M1),
 which is evidence that relative XXH3-128 ratios do transfer between aarch64 cores,
 for the one pair that can be checked.

## Ranking

`twox-hash` > `rscrypto` > `hashcrew` > `xxhash-rust` > `highway`.

The aarch64 measurement swapped third and fourth place.
Before it,
 the order was `twox-hash` > `rscrypto` > `xxhash-rust` > `hashcrew` > `highway`
 ("Scoring", totals before the aarch64 measurement).

Reason for each adjacent pair:

- `twox-hash` over `rscrypto`:
   they tie on all three weight-5 criteria,
   now including a measured aarch64 rating of 4 each,
   so the pair is decided by the weight-1 criteria,
   where `twox-hash` leads on auditability
   (1,533 lines on the used path against 7,496 inside a 177,154-line crate)
   and on maintenance
   (eleven years and 53.4M recent downloads against four months and 1,108),
   while `rscrypto` ties it on every other criterion and leads on none.
  The margin is 1.5 points of 92.
  No test in the frozen matrix reverses it;
   the extra transfer test does,
   if `twox-hash`'s true aarch64 ratio on a release-blocking core is a full rating step below what was
   measured here
   ("Sensitivity", extra defined test).
- `rscrypto` over `hashcrew`:
   equal on all three weight-5 criteria,
   so again the weight-1 criteria decide.
  `rscrypto` leads on key composition (4 against 2),
   stability assurance (4 against 3),
   upstream verification (4 against 3),
   the non-blocking x86 builds (4 against 2),
   and maintenance (2.5 against 2);
   `hashcrew` leads only on auditability (4 against 2).
  The margin is 4.5 points,
   and it reverses when auditability carries weight 4.
- `hashcrew` over `xxhash-rust`:
   this is the pair the measurement moved.
  `hashcrew` is the fastest finalist in all three aarch64 cells and rates 4 there,
   while `xxhash-rust` rates 3 because its streaming path on that core runs at 0.71 of its own one-shot
   (21.273 against 29.859 GiB/s),
   which is worth 5 points at weight 5.
  `xxhash-rust` takes back 4 of them on key composition (4 against 2),
   maintenance (3 against 2),
   and the non-blocking x86 builds (3 against 2).
  The margin is 2 points,
   the smallest in the ranking after the top pair.
  It ties when key composition,
   maintenance,
   or the non-blocking builds carries weight 3,
   or when aarch64 throughput is lowered to 3,
   and reverses at weight 4 or more for the first three and at weight 2 or less for aarch64 throughput.
- `xxhash-rust` over `highway`:
   `xxhash-rust` computes XXH3-128 at the top of the field on whole files on both architectures,
   while `highway` reaches 0.28 of it on `x86-64-v4` and 0.23 on the Apple M1,
   which is now a measured 0 rather than a source-analysis range;
   `highway`'s only advantage is SMHasher3 quality,
   worth one point at weight 1.
  The margin is 41 points.

Pros and cons:

- `twox-hash` 2.1.4 (MIT).
  Pros:
   top or within band on every measured x86-64 workload;
   within 0.6% of the fastest finalist on whole files,
   and 2.6% on streaming,
   on the aarch64 core measured here,
   which is the only crate-to-crate aarch64 comparison this vet ran itself;
   run-time dispatch, so the non-blocking builds keep AVX2 speed;
   property tests against the C library for every kernel, plus Miri in upstream CI;
   agrees with the C xxHash reference in the 82,200-comparison aarch64 run;
   eleven years of releases and 53.4M recent downloads;
   `rand` and `serde` are its only dependencies and both are optional.
  Cons:
   the aarch64 core measured is `aarch64-apple-darwin`, not a release-blocking Linux target,
   and a full rating step of transfer error there would hand first place to `rscrypto`;
   one maintainer;
   the XXH3-128 quality profile (36 SMHasher3 failures) is shared with the other XXH3 crates;
   no library parallel mode.
- `rscrypto` 0.9.0 (MIT OR Apache-2.0).
  Pros:
   one-shot aarch64 parity with `xxhash-rust` on two different aarch64 cores,
   and ahead of it on the streaming workload on the core measured here;
   rates 4 on all three weight-5 criteria;
   run-time dispatch with the best non-blocking-build behaviour;
   the most extensive upstream verification of the five,
   including a differential fuzz target for XXH3 against `xxhash-rust` that ran 46.8M executions here
   without a finding;
   a stated portable reference path that its SIMD and assembly kernels are tested against;
   its BLAKE3 and SHA-2 are in the same crate if meow ever needs a cryptographic key.
  Cons:
   four months old with 1,108 recent downloads and one maintainer;
   the XXH3 path is 7,496 lines inside a 177,154-line cryptography suite,
   so an audit covers much more code than a single-purpose crate;
   its aarch64 geometric mean of 0.921 is the closest of the four XXH3 crates to a rating step down;
   an MSRV of 1.91.0;
   a fast release cadence (16 releases in four months) means more version churn.
- `hashcrew` 0.3.0 (Apache-2.0).
  Pros:
   top of the field on whole files and multi-GB streaming on `x86-64-v4`,
   and the fastest finalist in every aarch64 cell measured here;
   its aarch64 kernel is selected at compile time, so it pays no dispatch there,
   which the `backend` probe confirms on the machine;
   the smallest disciplined source surface of the five (1,511 lines, denied undocumented `unsafe`);
   Miri with strict provenance in upstream CI;
   agrees with the C xxHash reference in the 82,200-comparison aarch64 run.
  Cons:
   two weeks old with 202 recent downloads;
   half the speed of `xxhash-rust` on the short-input workload on both architectures;
   0.40 and 0.34 of the best finalist on the baseline and `x86-64-v2` builds,
   although its backend probe reports AVX2 in every build;
   a maintenance rating that still rests on weeks of history.
- `xxhash-rust` 0.8.18 (BSL-1.0).
  Pros:
   fastest on the short-input workloads on both architectures;
   within band of the fastest finalist on whole files on both;
   1,396 lines on the used path with no runtime dependencies;
   29.6M recent downloads over five years.
  Cons:
   slowest of the five on the aarch64 streaming workload,
   at 0.75 of the fastest finalist and 0.71 of its own one-shot on the same core,
   which is what costs it third place;
   compile-time kernel selection,
   so the baseline and `x86-64-v2` builds run its SSE2 kernel at 0.64 and 0.66 of the best finalist;
   no property tests, no fuzz target, and no Miri in upstream CI;
   no written output-stability promise of its own beyond the XXH3 specification.
- `highway` 1.3.0 (MIT).
  Pros:
   the only finalist that passes every SMHasher3 test;
   a fuzz target comparing its kernels with the C implementation;
   a frozen algorithm with reference vectors;
   agrees with the C HighwayHash reference on aarch64 silicon.
  Cons:
   0.28 of XXH3-128 on whole files on `x86-64-v4` and a measured 0.23 on the Apple M1,
   which is below the threshold for a rating of 1 on aarch64;
   207 `unsafe` items across 2,955 lines with no safety comments;
   no release in the last year.

## Recommendation

Adopt `twox-hash` 2.1.4 XXH3-128 for meow's 128-bit content and cache keys,
 through its one-shot `XxHash3_128::oneshot` for whole files
 and its `XxHash3_128` streaming state for inputs meow does not hold in memory.

The reading this relies on:
 the user's speed-first weighting,
 with cryptographic hashes competing under the same weights,
 and with the release-blocking builds being `x86-64-v4` on x86-64 and both aarch64 targets.
Under that reading the deciding evidence is throughput on the release-blocking builds,
 and the field separates by an order of magnitude before any judgement enters:

- Whole files, `x86-64-v4`:
   XXH3-128 at 47.0 to 47.7 GiB/s,
   the fastest cryptographic or AES-based candidate, AES-PMAC over AES-NI and VAES, at 5.9,
   BLAKE3 at 4.6,
   SHA-256 with the SHA extensions at 2.3.
- Whole files, measured on an Apple M1 aarch64 core:
   XXH3-128 at 29.7 to 30.9 GiB/s,
   AES-PMAC at 3.9,
   SHA-256 with the Armv8 SHA-2 extension at 2.1,
   BLAKE3 at 1.5.
- Multi-GB from disk, warm page cache:
   XXH3-128 at 13.1 to 15.4 GiB/s,
   BLAKE3 at 5.4,
   SHA-256 at 2.0;
   cold, storage bounds every candidate to the same 0.33 to 1.59 GiB/s.

So making cryptographic hashes eligible did not change the answer's shape:
 they lose on the weight-5 criteria by factors of 8 to 20,
 and no weight-1 criterion can recover that.
The open question the premise change moved is which XXH3-128 crate,
 and there the top two are within 1.5 points of 92.

Confidence:
 high that the recommended function is XXH3-128;
 moderate that the recommended crate is `twox-hash` rather than `rscrypto`.
The aarch64 measurement raised that confidence without settling it.
Before it,
 one test in the frozen sensitivity matrix reversed the top pair,
 and that test rested on a borrowed number.
Now no test in the matrix reverses it,
 and `twox-hash` wins all 96
 ("Sensitivity").
What remains is the architecture proxy:
 the measured core is `aarch64-apple-darwin` on an Apple Firestorm core,
 and a full rating step of transfer error to a release-blocking Linux aarch64 core would still hand
 first place to `rscrypto`
 ("Sensitivity", extra defined test).

Both crates in contention produce the identical XXH3-128 digest,
 which this vet now confirms on both architectures against the C reference
 ("Reference equality"),
 so choosing one and switching later costs one cache rebuild and no format change.

The measurement that would remove the remaining proxy is a run of the same five finalists on a
 release-blocking aarch64 Linux target,
 on hardware rather than under QEMU.
No such machine is in reach here;
 the closest available substitute would be a rented Arm Linux instance,
 which this vet did not use because renting infrastructure is not an authorized action
 ("Confidence and limits").

## Risks and usage rules for XXH3-128

These apply to whichever XXH3-128 crate meow adopts.

Risks:

- No collision resistance against an adversary who knows the seed.
  The seed is a constant in the binary,
   so a repository that can run meow's tasks can also craft two file contents with the same cache key.
  The user's accepted reasoning is that such a repository already runs its own code under meow,
   and that the cache is local and rebuildable.
  The risk that remains is a repository that ships crafted files without running tasks,
   for example one whose build is fully cached;
   a wrong cache hit there produces a wrong artifact rather than code execution.
- SMHasher3 failures.
  XXH3-128 fails 36 of 250 SMHasher3 tests
  ("Quality and stability assurance"),
   none of them a full-width 128-bit collision.
  For a cache key of a 128-bit width the practical exposure is the birthday bound,
   about 2^64 keys,
   which meow's repositories do not approach.
- Crate-level risk rather than algorithm risk.
  The algorithm is frozen and identical across implementations
   (checked here by cross-implementation equality),
   so a bug would be in one crate's kernel,
   and the cost of switching crates is a rebuild of the local cache.

Usage rules:

- Use the one-shot function for whole files that fit in memory
   and the streaming state for anything larger,
   because the streaming output equals the one-shot output for every chunking tested
   ("HC10 streaming").
- Fix the seed as a constant and treat it as part of the cache-key format:
   changing it invalidates every key,
   which is a cache rebuild,
   not a correctness problem.
- Keep the key at the full 128 bits.
  Truncating further re-enters the birthday bound much sooner.
- Every raised build (`x86-64-v2`, `v3`, `v4`, or any `-Ctarget-feature`)
   needs meow's startup capability check before any hashing,
   because a raised build may contain instructions the running CPU lacks.
  This is independent of the crate:
   `x86-64-v4` enables `avx512f`,
   and the prior vet measured an illegal-instruction death for a raised build under an older QEMU CPU model.
- If meow ever needs a key that resists an adversary who knows the seed,
   that is a different decision:
   the cryptographic candidates measured here run at 4% to 10% of XXH3-128's speed on both architectures,
   and the fastest of them on this host was AES-PMAC at 5.9 GiB/s against 47.7.

## Confidence and limits

- The aarch64 hardware that ran is not a release-blocking target.
  S5 is measured on an Apple M1 through `aarch64-apple-darwin`,
   while the release-blocking aarch64 targets are `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`
   and the static-pie musl target.
  What transfers is each crate's aarch64 NEON path,
   which is the same code on both operating systems;
   what does not transfer automatically is the microarchitecture,
   an Apple Firestorm core against the Neoverse-class cores those targets usually run on.
  This is the largest remaining uncertainty in the ranking,
   because S5 carries weight 5 and because a one-step transfer error on `twox-hash` reverses first place
   ("Sensitivity", extra defined test).
  The one pair with numbers from two different aarch64 cores,
   `xxhash-rust` against `rscrypto`,
   keeps its relation on both,
   which is evidence for transfer but covers one pair only.
- The aarch64 correctness evidence is now silicon,
   not only QEMU:
   82,200 comparisons with the C reference implementations,
   the one-byte collision sweep,
   the chunking-equality sweep,
   and byte-identical digests against the x86 build over the whole corpus,
   each with a positive control
   ("Reference equality", "Additional validation").
  What remains emulated is the release-blocking Linux aarch64 target itself,
   including its musl static-pie link.
- The aarch64 machine was in use by its owner during the campaign.
  Load averages, thermal state, and swap are recorded before and after every run,
   the ratings use per-cell medians of five runs,
   and the run-to-run band is measured first on an unchanged build,
   but individual runs on the `m1-native` build are noisier than the `m1-generic` ones
   ("S5: aarch64 evidence", thermal and load state).
- No multi-GB or multi-core workload ran on aarch64.
  S3 and S4 stay x86-only,
   as frozen,
   and the 16 GiB memory cap on that machine rules out repeating them there
   (`AGENTS.md` rule `HRM`).
- Another agent was building and testing on the x86 host during part of the benchmark campaign.
  Load average is recorded before and after every run
   (`data/bench/progress-a.txt`),
   and the ratings use per-cell medians of five runs.
- The cold multi-GB numbers are storage-bound on the x86 host,
   so they separate candidates only where a candidate is slower than the storage path.
- `rscrypto`'s published aarch64 and x86 BLAKE3 rows are multi-threaded on the rscrypto side
   and single-threaded on the `blake3` side,
   which is why this vet uses them only for XXH3-128, SHA-2, and SHA-3,
   and treats the BLAKE3 pair as evidence about the parallel mode rather than about kernels.
- Upstream suites for the four reused finalists were run by the prior vet earlier the same day,
   not re-run here;
   the crate versions,
   host,
   toolchains,
   and images are the same.
- Two finalists are young crates with small dependent bases
   (`hashcrew` first published 2026-09-02, `rscrypto` 2026-05-02),
   so their maintenance ratings rest on weeks or months of history rather than years.

## The `ssh m1` run

The user powered the machine on for this measurement on 2026-09-17 and asked for it to be measured.
This section records what the run did,
 what it changed,
 and what it left on the machine.

### What it changed in this report

- S5 stopped being the one criterion rated from borrowed numbers and source reading.
  All five finalists now have five-run medians on one aarch64 core,
   on two builds,
   with the run-to-run band measured first on an unchanged build
   ("S5: aarch64 evidence").
- Two S5 ratings moved:
   `xxhash-rust` from 4 to 3,
   because its streaming path on that core runs at 0.75 of the fastest finalist;
   `highway` from a source-analysis midpoint of 2 to a measured 0.
  `hashcrew`'s low-signal range of 2 to 4 collapsed to a measured 4,
   the top of the aarch64 field.
- The ranking's third and fourth places swapped:
   `hashcrew` 85.9% now leads `xxhash-rust` 83.7%.
  First and second are unchanged.
- The sensitivity matrix no longer has a test that changes the winner.
  Before the run,
   `rating twox-hash.S5 4->3` handed first place to `rscrypto`,
   and that rating rested on upstream's Apple M1 Max table.
  `twox-hash`'s aarch64 rating is now measured at 0.988 of the fastest finalist,
   which is high confidence under the frozen rule,
   so the frozen procedure no longer steps it
   ("Sensitivity").
- The aarch64 correctness evidence moved from emulation to silicon:
   82,200 comparisons with the C xxHash and HighwayHash references, 0 mismatches;
   the one-byte collision sweep and the chunking-equality sweep clean for all five finalists;
   and byte-identical digests against the `x86-64-v4` build over the whole 152,231,070-byte corpus.
  Each has a positive control that failed as designed
   ("Reference equality", "Additional validation").

### What it did not settle

An Apple M1 measures `aarch64-apple-darwin`.
The release-blocking aarch64 targets are `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` and the static-pie musl target,
 and neither ran on hardware here.
A full rating step of transfer error on `twox-hash` between those cores would still reverse the top pair
 ("Sensitivity", extra defined test),
 so the crate choice rests on a measurement plus a transfer assumption rather than on a measurement alone.

The multi-GB and multi-core workloads did not run there:
 S3 and S4 are frozen to the x86 host,
 and the machine's 16 GiB cap rules them out anyway.

### What was installed, and what was left behind

Everything the measurement needed was installed under `/Volumes/MacData`,
 per `AGENTS.md` rule `HRM`:

- The pinned toolchain `nightly-2026-09-12` into a scratch `RUSTUP_HOME`
   at `/Volumes/MacData/agent/hashvet2-m1-2026-09-17/rustup`,
   minimal profile,
   452 MiB.
- A scratch `CARGO_HOME` (133 MiB) and the build directories (171 MiB),
   with `CACHEDIR.TAG` in each,
   plus the transferred corpus (146 MiB) and the probe crates;
   921 MiB for the whole tree.
- Crate sources fetched from `index.crates.io` into that scratch `CARGO_HOME`.
  Registry requests carry Cargo's own user agent and no identifying information.
- No system package manager,
   no change to the machine's own `~/.cargo/bin` toolchain,
   and no change to its default-toolchain setting.

One unintended write to the internal SSD happened and was undone.
A chained probe command carried `RUSTUP_HOME` on its first step only,
 so the `rustc` proxy on its second step resolved against the machine's own `~/.rustup`
 and auto-installed `nightly-2026-09-12` there with the default profile, 1.4 GB
 (`doc/troubleshooting/rustup-proxy-auto-install-default-home.md`).
It was removed with `rustup toolchain uninstall nightly-2026-09-12-aarch64-apple-darwin`;
 `~/.rustup` is back to its own `nightly-aarch64-apple-darwin` at 1.8 GB,
 and `~/.rustup/settings.toml` still names that toolchain as the default,
 unchanged throughout.

Disk state observed:
 the internal volume had 114 GiB free at the start and 111 GiB at the end,
 and `/Volumes/MacData` went from 216 GiB free to 215 GiB.
This run's only internal-disk artifact was the 1.4 GB toolchain,
 which was removed,
 so it does not account for the 3 GiB difference on the internal volume.
What does was not measured;
 Spotlight indexing (`mdworker_shared`, `STExtractionService`) and a
 `com.apple.MobileAsset.DownloadService` process were running on the machine at the start of the session,
 and APFS reclaims lazily,
 so the figure is recorded rather than explained.

The scratch tree at `/Volumes/MacData/agent/hashvet2-m1-2026-09-17` is left in place,
 because the report cites its logs.
Deleting it removes nothing this report depends on beyond those citations.
