## Context and hard constraints

Candidate H requires one Kimi-family verifier so each Qwen or MiniMax candidate can receive two clean nonself ballots from
distinct model families.
Candidate H's Kimi K3 author and all-candidate verifier both reached 16,000 output tokens with `max_tokens` stop reason.
Candidate I reduces one verifier response to one candidate and replaces status arrays with exact compact status strings.

Owner's standing instruction in `package/module/translation-repair/src/anthropic-request.ts` and
`package/module/translation-repair/src/chat-contract.ts` forbids thinking,
budget,
temperature,
or effort knobs because prior serving stacks returned errors,
degraded output,
or truncation.
A low-effort transport acceptance probe does not authorize changing that policy.
Every candidate in this vet therefore runs at provider and model defaults.

Hard constraints:

- Hyper-only normal operation;
- vision-capable model from Kimi family;
- complete source,
  archive,
  and every page-referenced image in each request;
- complete compact status coverage;
- structured JSON with caller validation;
- measured complete candidate-scoped response within provider output cap;
- no retry or route fallback;
- default model parameters only.

Base category is managed service or SaaS.
Overlays are incumbent model-route replacement and sensitive data.
Deployment is Node.js on Linux x64 against Charm Hyper by Anthropic Messages or OpenAI Chat Completions.
Restricted translation corpus and images cross existing managed-service boundary.
Raw provider output remains quarantined and cannot enter publication without deterministic validation.

No unresolved preference controls discovery or hard gates.
Quality is standing constraint;
cost is not criterion.

## Discovery schedule and result

Frozen initial query schedule:

- official Hyper `GET /v1/models` complete live enumeration;
- official Moonshot model list and K2.6,
  K2.7 Code,
  K3,
  thinking,
  vision,
  tool-choice,
  JSON Mode,
  and structured-output pages;
- `site:platform.moonshot.ai/docs Kimi K2.6 vision structured output default thinking`;
- `site:platform.moonshot.ai/docs Kimi K2.7 Code vision structured output default thinking`;
- `site:platform.moonshot.ai/docs Kimi K3 vision structured output reasoning effort default max`;
- `site:hyper.charm.land/docs Kimi model vision reasoning structured output`;
- `Kimi K2.6 K2.7 K3 structured output vision comparison official`;
- `Kimi K3 alternative Kimi K2.6 vision structured output verifier`;
- repository incumbent,
  prior vet reports,
  current transport,
  and Candidate H evidence.

Initial searches used provider relevance order with no include or exclude filter.
Official-model searches returned ten results each.
Hyper query returned ten results.
Broader comparison and alternative queries returned ten results each.
The live Hyper endpoint is exhaustive and has no pagination.
It enumerated Kimi K2.5,
K2.6,
K2.7 Code,
and K3;
no other Kimi-family row was present.

New taxonomy terms were Moonshot Flavored JSON Schema (MFJS),
JSON Schema strict mode,
and reasoning-inclusive truncation.
Frozen one-round expansion schedule:

- `site:platform.moonshot.ai/docs Kimi K2.6 MFJS simple schema strict reliability`;
- `site:platform.moonshot.ai/docs Kimi K2.7 structured output translation evaluation`;
- `site:platform.moonshot.ai/docs Kimi K3 response_format max_tokens reasoning truncation`.

Expansion produced no new model id.
First query returned no result,
second returned one unrelated older-model page,
and third returned four official capability pages.
Discovery is saturated through exhaustive incumbent catalog plus official model-family documentation.

## Candidate ledger

### Kimi K2.5

- Discovery:
  exhaustive live Hyper catalog.
- Live row:
  vision false.
- Screening:
  hard-gate exit because every verifier must receive page-referenced images.

### Kimi K2.6 with Hyper OpenAI structured output

- Discovery:
  exhaustive live Hyper catalog and prior roster vet.
- Live row:
  vision true,
  262,000 context,
  26,214 maximum output,
  medium default reasoning.
- Official behavior:
  thinking enabled by default;
  OpenAI `response_format` supports JSON Schema strict mode;
  official structured-output page warns K2.6 can be unstable on complex MFJS schemas and requires caller validation.
- Model source:
  `https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/guide/kimi-k2-6-quickstart`.
- Structured-output source:
  `https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/guide/response_format`.
- Candidate I fit:
  status strings and bounded flat findings avoid `$ref`,
  `oneOf`,
  and deep nesting.
- Parameters:
  defaults only.
- Screening:
  serious alternative pending exact route and consumer validation.

### Kimi K2.7 Code with Hyper OpenAI structured output

- Discovery:
  exhaustive live Hyper catalog and prior roster vet.
- Live row:
  vision true,
  262,000 context,
  16,000 maximum output.
- Official behavior:
  thinking always enabled;
  official structured-output page documents K2.7 Code support for nested schemas and describes it as more stable than
  K2.6 for that interface.
- Model source:
  `https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/guide/kimi-k2-7-code-quickstart`.
- Structured-output source:
  `https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/guide/response_format`.
- Risk:
  code-specialized model has unproven translation-review fit,
  and output ceiling equals K3 ceiling exhausted by Candidate H.
- Parameters:
  defaults only.
- Screening:
  serious alternative pending exact route and consumer validation.

### Kimi K3 with Hyper OpenAI structured output

- Discovery:
  exhaustive live Hyper catalog and incumbent Candidate H.
- Live row:
  vision true,
  1,048,576 context,
  16,000 maximum output,
  max default reasoning.
- Official behavior:
  official structured-output page documents K3 support for nested objects,
  arrays,
  and `anyOf`.
- Model source:
  `https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/guide/kimi-k3-quickstart`.
- Structured-output source:
  `https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/guide/response_format`.
- Runtime counterevidence:
  Candidate H K3 author and all-candidate verifier each ended at `max_tokens` with no usable tool
  response.
- Scope difference:
  Candidate I asks for one candidate and compact strings,
  so H result does not prove candidate-scoped response fails.
- Parameters:
  defaults only.
- Screening:
  serious alternative with measured truncation risk.

### Kimi K3 low-effort Anthropic tool route

- Discovery:
  bounded transport probe.
- Runtime:
  HTTP 200,
  forced tool accepted,
  96 output tokens,
  214 reasoning characters.
- Hard-gate exit:
  violates owner default-parameter-only policy and does not prove effort was honored.

## Managed-service gates

Charm Hyper is incumbent service and common to every surviving candidate.
`doc/audit/tech-candidate-e-hyper-roster-expansion-vet-2026-08-30.md` and existing provider decisions already inspect:

- layoffs and headcount;
- customer reviews;
- outages;
- funding,
  ownership,
  and business model;
- signup friction;
- security and abuse history;
- terms and pricing;
- suspension,
  appeal,
  and termination;
- privacy,
  data use,
  retention,
  deletion,
  and geography;
- availability,
  support,
  export,
  portability,
  lock-in,
  deprecation,
  and business continuity.

No candidate changes provider,
account,
credential,
data category,
retention path,
or geography.
Those findings are inherited common-mode evidence and do not order model ids.
Fresh live catalog and exact route behavior remain required because model capability can drift independently.

Open-source,
local executable,
native,
Wasm,
prebuilt,
human-auditability,
and multi-platform browser gates are not applicable:
selection changes one managed model row and provider protocol only.
No new local dependency or artifact is proposed.

## Frozen scoring criteria

Hard gates stay outside arithmetic.
Weights were frozen before candidate-specific runtime validation:

- structured-output reliability:
  weight 5;
- verifier fidelity and English-quality fit:
  weight 5;
- complete-response headroom:
  weight 4;
- operational simplicity within incumbent provider:
  weight 3;
- end-to-end latency:
  weight 1.

Ratings use zero through four:
zero serious concern,
one weak,
two acceptable,
three good,
and four strong.
Maximum score is
`(5 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 1) * 4 = 72`.
No rating is assigned before equal-depth runtime and consumer-boundary validation.
Sensitivity will raise each defaultable weight from one through five,
vary medium and low-confidence ratings by one,
and test every low-signal endpoint.

## Planned execution manifest

Candidate versions are exact live ids `kimi-k2.6`,
`kimi-k2.7-code`,
and `kimi-k3`.
Fresh catalog snapshot and response digest will pin hosted state immediately before spend.

Planned command is one inspected Node scratch runner using built-in `fetch` only.
It sends one payload per model concurrently to Hyper OpenAI Chat Completions with:

- same synthetic 1 by 1 image;
- same compact Candidate I-shaped JSON Schema;
- same non-corpus calibration prompt;
- model-default reasoning;
- each model's live output ceiling;
- streaming enabled;
- no retry.

Expected network endpoints are public `GET /v1/models` and authenticated `POST /v1/chat/completions` only.
Expected writes are private metadata-only files under `~/temp/agent/`.
No raw response,
credential,
corpus text,
or image from repository is retained.
Success requires HTTP 200,
non-truncating finish,
parseable exact status strings,
and one durable attempt row per model.
This synthetic image run proves transport and schema behavior only;
it does not satisfy Candidate I corpus-image or translation-review constraint.
Pinned-Carena validation sends actual page-referenced image and supplies consumer evidence.
Failure remains candidate evidence and causes no redispatch.

Execution runs on host rather than container because existing credential injection is scoped to project worktree and runner uses
only inspected standard-library code plus direct HTTPS.
It receives no home-directory path other than exact private output,
starts no subprocess,
and writes no repository file.
Process tool supplies lifecycle and stop notification;
each HTTP request has 360,000-millisecond abort signal.

After transport validation,
every survivor receives equal-depth pinned-Carena Candidate I verifier calibration and complete consumer-boundary review.
No model can be recommended from synthetic schema probe alone.

  every ledger row.
- Claim:
  exact hosted presence,
  vision,
  context,
  output,
  and default reasoning metadata.
- Gate:
  hard constraint and operational envelope.
- Status:
  K2.5 fails vision;
  K2.6,
  K2.7 Code,
  and K3 pass static screening.
- Primary source:
  `https://hyper.charm.land/v1/models`,
  accessed 2026-08-31.
- Private snapshot:
  `~/temp/agent/hyper-models-candidate-i-kimi-vet-20260831.json`,
  17,212 bytes,
  SHA-256 `d68a71501ffa7c67825467ef935c177ad0abb01560f81f17c3fe65fe88742ab7`.
- Corroboration:
  official Moonshot model docs.
- Outcome:
  finite Kimi roster enumerated.

### Structured-output compatibility

- Candidate:
  K2.6,
  K2.7 Code,
  and K3.
- Claim:
  direct OpenAI route can request strict JSON Schema at model defaults.
- Gate:
  hard structured-output boundary.
- Status:
  documentation pass,
  runtime pending.
- Primary source:
  `https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/guide/response_format`,
  accessed 2026-08-31.
- Counterevidence:
  official docs warn K2.6 may violate complex schemas;
  caller validation remains mandatory.
- Outcome:
  all three advance to same synthetic route probe.

### Default-thinking policy

- Candidate:
  every survivor.
- Claim:
  no non-default thinking,
  effort,
  budget,
  or sampling parameter may be sent.
- Gate:
  hard repository policy.
- Status:
  pass by planned omission.
- Primary source:
  `package/module/translation-repair/src/anthropic-request.ts` and
  `package/module/translation-repair/src/chat-contract.ts`.
- Counterevidence:
  low-effort K3 probe established transport acceptance only.
- Outcome:
  low-effort route excluded.

### Candidate H K3 truncation

- Candidate:
  K3.
- Claim:
  current all-candidate shape did not fit K3 default 16,000-token completion.
- Gate:
  scored headroom concern,
  not candidate-scoped hard failure.
- Status:
  observed twice.
- Evidence:
  `~/temp/agent/prototype-Carena-H-bounded-verdict-20260831/calibration-summary.json`.
- Outcome:
  K3 enters validation with measured downside.

## Current disposition

No recommendation.
K2.6,
K2.7 Code,
and K3 remain serious alternatives pending equal-depth route probe and pinned-Carena Candidate I consumer validation.
Product code,
dependency configuration,
and decision records must not adopt one before report reaches validated,
scored,
and sensitivity-stable state.
