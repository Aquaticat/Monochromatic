# The relocation `#107` describes, measured in one settled entry

Read 2026-08-18 from `GLaDOSister.json`,
the first entry settled by the targeted flagged pass.
One entry decides nothing.
What it does is show the mechanism `#107` names,
in numbers,
at exactly the slices a structural probe flagged before the pass ran.

NO CORPUS TEXT IS REPRODUCED HERE.
Everything below is character counts and ratios.

## What the probe said, before any of this existed

`displacement-probe` flagged this entry with two relocation candidates
and a document baseline of 2.739 English characters per source character:

```text
high 3, low 2, surplus 254, deficit  91
high 3, low 4, surplus 254, deficit 100
```

Read plainly:
slice 3 carries far more English than its source accounts for,
and slices 2 and 4 carry less than theirs do.

The incumbent archive bears that out:

```text
slice  source chars  incumbent chars  ratio   against baseline 2.739
    2           266              638   2.40   slightly under
    3            42              369   8.78   more than three times over
    4           112              207   1.85   well under
```

## What the pipeline did to those slices

Both lanes shipped a replacement at all three,
and the character deltas are the finding:

```text
slice   incumbent   repair shipped   delta    translate shipped   delta
    2         638              648     +10                  610     -28
    3         369              128    -241                  120    -249
    4         207              458    +251                  434    +227
```

Slice 3 lost about 240 characters and slice 4 gained about 240,
in both lanes, within a dozen characters of each other,
and they are separate judgements rather than one echoed twice:
across the whole entry they disagree about slices 0 and 5.

NO TEXT ACTUALLY MOVED, and the first reading of this document said it did.
Checked by asking how many 40-character windows of the newly shipped text at slices 2 and 4
also occur in slice 3's incumbent wording:
the answer is ZERO, in both entries, in both lanes.
The content at the deficit slices is NEWLY WRITTEN,
not the surplus slice's wording carried across.
Length arithmetic looked like movement and was not evidence of it.

The test detects verbatim reuse rather than paraphrase,
so it rules out relocation of the text
and cannot rule out relocation of the meaning.

Afterwards the ratios sit near the document baseline where they were far from it:

```text
slice   incumbent ratio   repair ratio   translate ratio
    3              8.78           3.05              2.86
    4              1.85           4.09              3.88
```

Slice 3 came back to the baseline from more than three times it.
Slice 4 overshot,
from well under to somewhat over,
which is worth noticing rather than explaining away.

## It replicates in the second entry, with the archive discarded rather than moved

`lintong` settled next and the probe flagged the same shape,
`high 3, low 2, surplus 281` and `high 3, low 4, surplus 281`:

```text
slice  source  incumbent  ratio   repair shipped  ratio   translate shipped  ratio
    2      43         25   0.58              138   3.21                 131   3.05
    3      55        439   7.98              449   8.16                 189   3.44
    4      41         39   0.95              121   2.95                 115   2.80
```

THE DEFICIT SLICES WERE FILLED IN BOTH ENTRIES AND BOTH LANES,
from ratios of 0.58 and 0.95 back to about 3, against a document baseline near 2.8.

THE SURPLUS SLICE WAS TREATED DIFFERENTLY BY THE TWO LANES HERE.
Translate rewrote it from 439 characters to 189, keeping ZERO of its 150 windows from the incumbent.
Repair left it at 449, ten characters longer, keeping 167 of 410 windows.
So after the repair lane, `lintong` still carries its surplus at slice 3
AND newly written content at slices 2 and 4.
On `GLaDOSister` both lanes drained the surplus, keeping 2 and 1 windows of about 85.
Two entries are not a pattern; the difference is recorded so a third can confirm or refute it.

## What this does and does not settle

IT SETTLES THAT THE FLAGGED SLICES ARE WHERE THE ARCHIVE IS DISCARDED.
A structural probe that never sees the pipeline's output
predicted which slices would be replaced,
and every one of them was,
in both entries and both lanes,
with the surplus slice's wording largely or entirely rewritten rather than carried anywhere.

IT DOES NOT SETTLE WHETHER THE MOVE IS REPAIR OR DAMAGE,
and that is the whole of `#107`.
The pipeline pulled a passage back to the slice whose source carries it.
If the archive's translator moved that clause deliberately, for flow across a paragraph break,
then this undid a legitimate choice and no per-slice instrument could have known.
If it drifted by accident, this fixed it.
Telemetry cannot tell those apart,
because both look identical from inside one slice.

WHAT WOULD ANSWER IT is a human reading of these specific passages,
which is a much smaller ask than a general damage sheet:
the flagged slices in this pass number sixteen,
against the twenty items the last damage sheet carried.

## The critics are NOT what condemns the archive here

`#107` is titled for per-slice JUDGING condemning the archive,
and the natural reading is that critics file more claims where a relocation makes the incumbent
look wrong.
Counted from `chunkCritics[].claimAttributions` over the two settled entries,
that reading FAILS:

```text
             slices   source chars   claims   per slice   per 100 chars
flagged           6            559       71        11.8            12.7
unflagged         9            778      118        13.1            15.2
```

FLAGGED SLICES ATTRACT FEWER CLAIMS, not more,
on both denominators,
while shipping a replacement 100 percent of the time against about 72 percent elsewhere.
The busiest slice in either document is `GLaDOSister` slice 1, unflagged, with 30 claims.

SO THE TWO THINGS COME APART, and that is the finding.
Whatever makes a flagged slice always ship,
it is not that the critic stage complains about it more.

THE REMAINING CANDIDATE is the preserve-or-replace judgement in the translate lane,
which weighs a fresh translation of the slice against the incumbent wording.
A slice whose incumbent carries content its own source does not account for
loses that comparison almost by construction,
because the fresh translation matches the source and the incumbent visibly does not.
That is a DIFFERENT MECHANISM from the one `#107`'s title names,
and it predicts exactly what was observed:
replacement without extra criticism.

WHAT WOULD TEST IT: read the per-slice selection records rather than the critic claims,
and ask whether the incumbent's margin of defeat is larger at flagged slices.
That reading needs no new run.

SIX FLAGGED SLICES IS NOT A RESULT.
Both entries carry the same flag shape, at 2, 3 and 4,
so this is close to two observations rather than fifteen.
It is recorded now because it points the remaining analysis somewhere different,
and because a story that only ever gains confirmation is not being tested.

## Read this against the replacement rate, not instead of it

The rate reading on the same entry is
1.0000 on flagged slices against 0.7143 on the rest,
pooled over both lanes.
That is direction only:
three flagged slices per lane,
and three of three is the largest number the instrument can print.
The lengths above are the more informative half of the same observation,
because they say WHAT changed rather than only that something did.

## Relocation is LOCAL: the longest flagged run in the whole pool is three slices

Measured 2026-08-18 over the 92 entries in `~/temp/agent/displacement.log`,
1260 slices,
by mapping every flag back onto its slice index and looking at where the marks fall.
Script: `~/temp/agent/slide-shape.mjs`.

```text
entries probed                                   92
entries carrying at least one flag               29
slices                                         1260
flagged slices                                   80   0.0635
contiguous runs of flagged slices                51
longest run                                       3
mean run length                                1.57
```

The marks per entry,
`R` the surplus side of a relocation pair,
`r` its deficit side,
`U` untranslated,
`T` target-only,
`S` transcription suspect,
`M` markup donor,
`O` other imbalance:

```text
Dethelly          2/24  [Rr......................]
GLaDOSister       3/10  [..rRr.....]
aiyysk            6/80  [...............Rr..........................Rr.............rR....................]
dogesir_          4/10  [..rR....rR]
lintong           3/5   [..rRr]
saurikissa        4/11  [...OT...rR.]
wangzihao980      2/6   [...rR.]
windward0032      8/21  [...T....RrR...Rr.O.O.]
zhangyubaka       3/31  [..........................rRr..]
```

EVERY RELOCATION PAIR IN THE POOL IS ADJACENT.
`Rr`, `rR` and `rRr` are the only shapes that occur.
Not once does a surplus slice pair with a deficit slice further than one position away.

## Why the shape matters more than the count

THIS IS NOT `#71`.
The section aligner's failure slid a whole document by two,
so every pairing in the entry was wrong and no local remedy could reach it.
What the slice probe finds instead is a passage that crossed ONE boundary,
leaving a hole on one side and a bulge on the other.

That has three consequences.

A WIDER JUDGING WINDOW WOULD SEE THE MOVED TEXT.
A per-slice judge shown slice `n` alone cannot tell a relocation from a fabrication,
which is what `#107` is about.
A judge shown `n-1`, `n` and `n+1` would have the relocated passage in front of it in every case measured here,
because the longest run is three and every pair is adjacent.
This is a bounded change with a measured bound,
not an open-ended widening.

THE GRADING SHEET CAN RESTORE A COHERENT COMPARISON by merging a run.
Asked about `lintong` slice 2 alone,
a human is shown a 43-character Chinese passage
against a 25-character English line that is the ATTRIBUTION of the block above it
rather than a translation of anything in that passage,
and there is no honest answer to "did the edit damage this".
Asked about slices 2 through 4 together,
the English does contain the translation of the Chinese,
and the question means something again.
The grader's comments on the first sheet,
at items 3 and 5,
both said the matching looked broken,
and both landed on flagged slices.

MERGING IS NOT A GUARANTEE.
A run's own ends can still be offset,
which is why the second sheet keeps an explicit way for a grader to report a mismatch
rather than assuming the merge fixed every case.

## The harm is visible in the finished document: `lintong` says the same thing twice

Found 2026-08-18 while checking the second grading sheet by reading one merged item end to end.
This is the first instance where the damage relocation causes
is legible in the assembled output rather than inferred from a rate.

NO CORPUS TEXT IS REPRODUCED HERE.
The passages themselves are in the artifacts and in the sheet,
both of which live outside this repository.
What follows is a count and a description.

The repair lane's `lintong` document ends with a four-line blockquote
that offers the same dish twice within those four lines
and that also repeats an invitation the two paragraphs immediately above it already made.
Those two paragraphs are slice 2's shipped text.

Counting the two distinguishing noun phrases across the whole assembled document,
where each should occur once in the farewell:

```text
lane        dish phrase   drink phrase
repair                2              2
translate             1              1
```

## Why the repair lane produces it and the translate lane does not

The archive had the whole farewell,
four sentences of it,
sitting in slice 3's incumbent,
while slice 3's ORIGINAL is one sentence long.

The translate lane writes each slice from its source,
so it produced one sentence for slice 3 and the duplication never arose.

The repair lane edits the incumbent in place.
Handed a one-sentence original and a four-sentence incumbent,
it repaired the matching sentence INSIDE the block and left the other three where they were,
which is a defensible thing to do to the text in front of it
and the wrong thing to do to the document.
Slice 2's own new translation then supplied those three a second time.

NEITHER LANE DID ANYTHING UNREASONABLE WITH WHAT IT WAS SHOWN.
That is the whole of `#107`:
the pairing was wrong before either lane saw it,
and per-slice work cannot recover from that
because no slice has enough of the document in view to notice.

A judge shown slices 2 through 4 together would see the repeat.
The measured bound in this same document says three slices is enough,
because the longest flagged run in the corpus is three.

## One severed sentence shipped, at a slice beside a flagged run

Found the same way,
by reading a merged sheet item end to end,
then scanned for across all 64 shipped rows with `~/temp/agent/severed-sentence-census.mjs`.
The detector looks for a function word that cannot end a clause
followed by a capitalised clause-starting pronoun,
excluding pairs the incumbent already carried.

ONE TRUE POSITIVE IN THE POOL,
`saurikissa` slice 7,
repair lane:
a clause is cut off after its preposition
and the next word begins an unrelated independent clause,
so the two are spliced into one ungrammatical sentence.
The text itself is in the artifact and on the sheet, not here.

The detector fired five other times,
all ordinary prose where a pronoun follows `and`, `that` or a question mark,
so this is one instance rather than a pattern:
1 of 30 shipped repair rows and 0 of 34 translate rows.

Slice 7 is not itself flagged.
It sits immediately beside the flagged run at 8 and 9,
and its shipped text carries three passages that belong to neighbouring slices.
The translate lane at the same slice is clean
and renders only what the original says.

THE SAME LANE SPLIT AS `lintong`.
Two entries now show the repair lane producing broken text at relocation-affected slices
while the translate lane produces correct text,
for the same reason:
one edits an incumbent that belongs somewhere else,
the other writes from the source.
