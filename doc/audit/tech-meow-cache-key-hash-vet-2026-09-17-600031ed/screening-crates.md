# Screening appendix: every crates.io result

Appendix to [`tech-meow-cache-key-hash-vet-2026-09-17-600031ed.md`](../tech-meow-cache-key-hash-vet-2026-09-17-600031ed.md),
 section "Screening".
One entry per distinct crate returned by the crates.io queries of this vet
 (CC01 to CC24 and XC01 to XC04)
 and of the prior vet
 (CR01 to CR14, XR01 to XR04, reused under "Reuse of prior evidence"),
 at its newest stable version on 2026-09-17.

How outcomes were assigned:

- Crates reviewed by hand carry the outcome written in this vet's review map,
   `~/temp/agent/hashvet2-2026-09-17/scripts/review.json`.
- A crate whose runtime dependency is itself an accelerated hash crate is a consumer,
   not a hash library of its own;
   the underlying crate carries the screening outcome.
- Crates with intrinsic matches for both architectures or a SIMD abstraction,
   and not reviewed as hash libraries,
   were read by description and source layout and are category mismatches.
- Every other crate had intrinsic matches for at most one architecture,
   no SIMD abstraction,
   and no accelerated dependency in its non-test Rust sources,
   which fails HC1 regardless of category.
