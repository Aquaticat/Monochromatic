# Translation repair handover snapshot: 2026-09-06

Part of the [current translation repair handover](translation-repair.md).
The previous snapshot is
[`translation-repair-handover-2026-09-04.md`](translation-repair-handover-2026-09-04.md).

The owner returned with Synthetic refilled to a third and Hyper wet,
OpenRouter still uncharged,
and the instruction not to wait on it.
Before the first page,
two defaults that had never shipped a page became the configuration every shipped page had run,
the owner wrote one operating rule,
and the first pass on the plain invocation found the fifth defect class in 28.6 minutes.
The pipeline is still not production ready,
and the reason is recorded in
[`translation-repair-readiness-signal.md`](../planning/translation-repair-readiness-signal.md).

## Where the work stands

Three pages of `yulianNyanner` shipped on the plain invocation today and each was read:
21:03 on the class-five build (44.9 minutes,
found the sixth class),
22:10 on the class-six build (39.4 minutes,
headings held,
found the seventh),
each at zero USD with an unstarved consolidation and `verify-published` matched.
The seventh class is fixed and proven,
and the next action is the relaunch of `yulianNyanner` on the class-seven build into a fresh runs dir,
then its reading by the seven steps in the 2026-09-04 snapshot,
"How a pass is launched and read",
which gained the apostrophe count today.
If a pass is running when this is read and the tree has moved past its tip,
the kill-and-relaunch rule applies.

The full unit suite emitted 934 `PASS` lines and zero `FAIL` lines on the class-five build;
the class-six suites,
the publisher,
critic and preparation suites are 0 `FAIL` on the class-six build.
oxlint 0 warnings and 0 errors,
types clean,
markdown lint clean on every line written today.

## Repository state

- Worktree:
  `/var/home/user/worktrees/translation-repair`.
- Branch:
  `translation-repair-rebased`,
  auto-push on.
- Tip:
  `cf1450162`.
- Corpus pinned at `a41fc607ea5a70d8a7625cc67d5ed8c444f53379` in `~/one-among-us/data`.
- Meters at 21:03 UTC:
  `synthetic=wet hyper=wet openrouter=wet syntheticWeekly=31.37% syntheticFiveHour=2750/2750`,
  Hyper 2686 credits,
  OpenRouter 0.32 USD.
  One stopped 28-minute attempt cost about 0.8 percent of the Synthetic week and 36 Hyper credits;
  no call reached OpenRouter,
  since routing spends Synthetic and Hyper first.

## What landed today

Newest first.

-   `bc42fe330`,
    `b669363b6`,
    `ec91a14f5` ship every stage's wording in the archive's quote convention at the would-ship reading,
    with guard `fd7701f49` shown to fail first,
    and add the 贴贴 example to the house policy;
    `c421c2e31` and `6b842dcdf` record the 22:10 page and add the apostrophe count to the reading steps.
-   `e5bd6bf0f` inventories `CollapsedHeadingError` for the names-only message check,
    after the full suite on the class-six build showed 2 `FAIL`;
    the 22:06 launch was killed for it under the rule.
-   `7effa1b73` records the first page and the sixth class;
    `7f0d84169` and `7a01c9048` close the oxlint findings in the new code.
-   `459b2007f` names the heading a source comment sits under on its identity-context line,
    says in the critic sheet and house policy what that anchor means,
    and refuses a page that renders two distinct source headings as one
    (`CollapsedHeadingError`),
    with guards `01b896ea7` shown to fail first and the floor proven by inversion.
-   `30ce3994f` writes this snapshot and points the hub and map at it.
-   `cf1450162`,
    `3ab2d318a`:
    the fifth class recorded in the planning log,
    the readiness signal and the README status.
-   `259708e79` reads a slice under the grammar the document was read in,
    HTML comments masked to same-length whitespace,
    with guards `ebf6524de` shown to fail on the unfixed build.
-   `304e3ed98`,
    `bd83628b8`:
    the day's planning-log and readiness sections.
-   `7a2bdbedf` builds the writer rounds' 180000 ms window in,
    never shorter than the round window,
    by the owner's decision;
    guard neutralised 4 `FAIL`,
    restored 0.
-   `56c2ab488`,
    `0d2203abd`:
    the always-kill-and-relaunch rule in the package README,
    the runbook's launch and restore steps,
    the handover hub,
    the 2026-09-04 snapshot,
    and the run-continuity and overlap-dial handovers.
-   `e50be2299` keeps four slices in flight in the corpus pass by default,
    on the four matched pairs `#261` asked for,
    with guard `bb5e97e0e` shown to fail first;
    record `doc/decision/translation-repair-pass-overlap.md`,
    flagged for the owner's veto.

## The fifth class

Found by the first pass on the plain invocation,
not by a test.
`parse-document.ts` masks HTML comments before its strict MDX parse;
`readSliceSkeleton` in `translate-skeleton.ts` did not,
so every slice whose original carried a translator note was "an original that could not be read",
the deterministic floor answered `unknown`,
and both gates that consume the floor treat `unknown` as inadmissible.
The entry stopped at consolidation with nothing to ship after 742 calls.
17 of 92 sources carry a comment,
34 comment lines in all,
14 of them in `yulianNyanner`;
none of the three pages that shipped on 2026-09-04 had one.
The archive renders that entry's fourteen comment lines as twelve English comments,
so comment parity is not a rule the archive itself would pass,
and whether a candidate carries a note rendered is left to the judges as wording.

The pattern of 2026-09-04 held:
a class per new source shape,
none on a repeat.

## The sixth class

Found by reading the first page the plain invocation shipped.
The page carries `## Dysphoria` twice,
for two different source headings,
because the source comment "the English word for this title is dysphoria",
which sits under the third heading,
reached every slice as an identity-context line with no position,
and seven of eight consolidation judges bound "this title" to the second heading
(ledger contest 000031 in the run dir).
A positional note carried without its position.
Each comment line now names "under heading X" or "before the first heading",
the sheets say a note about "this title" or "here" speaks of that heading and no other,
and the publisher refuses a would-ship page on which two headings that differ in the source read the same;
measured at pin `a41fc607`,
no source repeats a heading and no archive collapses two,
so the floor refuses nothing the archives would ship.

The same page repaired the archive in four places the reading could name
(the front matter `desc`,
a lyric syllable,
a school year,
a dropped attribution),
carried both `PhotoScroll` shapes and all fourteen comments,
and completed consolidation unstarved,
which closes the last open item of the 2026-09-04 snapshot.

## The seventh class

Found on the 22:10 page,
where the headings held.
Five contractions carry a straight apostrophe against thirty curly ones on a page whose archive is curly
throughout,
and the `Uekawakuyuurei` page of 2026-09-04 carries the same mix unread.
`restore-typography.ts` runs on every editor and refiner replacement and on nothing else,
so a translate-lane wording,
a consolidation proposal or a polish rewrite reached the page in whatever quote style its model wrote.
The would-ship reading,
which every publisher and checker derives the page from,
now puts each non-archive wording through the restoration against the row's incumbent and the stored archive
text;
the artifact keeps what the stages wrote.
The reading steps gain the apostrophe count,
since this is a property four shipped pages carried unmeasured.

Two wording findings are recorded for the judges rather than fixed:
贴贴 kept in Chinese with a gloss where an everyday English word exists
(the house policy now says so with this example),
and 自慰 read by its blunt literal sense in a quoted despairing thought.

## The two defaults and the rule

-   The corpus pass ran at overlap 1 by default while every page that shipped ran at 4 through a dial.
    The four matched pairs of 2026-08-27 and 2026-08-28 had already measured the effect
    (normalized wall down 0.09 to 0.27 against a 0.03 band,
    voices never worse);
    the 2026-09-01 hold had frozen the reading before it became a default.
    Moved to 4.
-   The writer rounds ran at 180000 ms through a dial while the built-in round window was 120000 ms.
    The straggler-grace record had reserved the question for the owner;
    asked with the four shipped logs' cut counts
    (writer-round cuts 4,
    6,
    11 and 20 against 28,
    35,
    26 and 135 reader-round cuts),
    the owner chose to build it in.
-   The owner's rule:
    ALWAYS KILL AND RELAUNCH.
    When source changes while a pass is running,
    kill the pass by pid,
    build,
    and relaunch the same entry into a fresh runs dir on the new build;
    a page finished on a superseded build is not readiness evidence;
    a known fix lands before the launch.
    The 19:53 launch was killed under it after 264 calls.
    The rule is deliberately not in the root `AGENTS.md`.

## How a pass is launched now

The plain invocation in
[`translation-repair-corpus-pass.md`](../runbook/translation-repair-corpus-pass.md) is the production launch:
a fresh `TRANSLATION_REPAIR_RUNS_DIR`,
no dial,
all three provider keys present.
The log opens with `OVERLAP <entry> value=4 source=fallback` and `WRITER GRACE built in`.
Every dial still works for a measured arm.
The seven reading steps are in the 2026-09-04 snapshot and are unchanged.

## What to do next

1.  Relaunch `yulianNyanner` on the class-seven build into a fresh runs dir and read its page,
    counting its straight apostrophes first.
2.  Run and read `Arita`,
    the other double-quoted-paths entry never run,
    after that reading rather than beside it,
    so a fix found in one reading does not kill two runs.
3.  Name from the corpus,
    rather than meet by accident,
    the next source shape no shipped page has carried,
    since every new shape so far has found a class on its first page.
4.  The OpenRouter top-up is the owner's and expected within days;
    nothing waits on it while Synthetic and Hyper are wet.
    One settled entry costs about 3.9 points of the Synthetic week and 64 Hyper credits at zero USD.

## Standing constraints

Unchanged from the 2026-09-04 snapshot:
never echo an API key value or read `/proc/<pid>/environ`;
never set `thinking`,
`budget_tokens` or `reasoning_effort`;
never write `Closes #N`;
spent Candidate A through M prompts are never redispatched;
credentials,
API keys,
image bytes and raw provider requests and responses stay private,
and the owner has relaxed everything else until the project is finished.
