# Translation repair history: segment 1.2

Part of the [translation repair history index](translation-repair-history.md).

## Current stop condition

Historical evidence only.
Candidate M failed on 2026-09-01.
No historical next-action list authorizes a corpus run,
model call,
spent-prompt retry,
or successor implementation.

## Continued record

### Preserved chronological continuation

## 2026-08-22, `#163` Commit A: the median landed, and the file's own history was wrong about why

Commit `39108d02c`.
`documentBaseline` now reads a document's expansion from the MIDDLE slice
rather than from a pooled character aggregate,
and slices whose sizes are
implausible on their face are kept out of the set that sets the bar.

### The comment in the file argued against the change, and it was stale

`displacement-ratio.ts` carried a region comment headed "WHY A DOCUMENT'S OWN
MEDIAN IS NOT THE STATISTIC",
citing `shi_Yumiaoya`'s median of 0.76 as the
failure that motivated pooling.
That failure does not reproduce.
Under both estimators `shi_Yumiaoya` falls back to the corpus reference,
because the eligibility filter,
which was added by a LATER change than the
comment,
removes its untranslated sections before either estimator sees them.
The filter was doing the work the comment credited to pooling,
and nothing had
ever checked which of the two was responsible.
The comment now records all three historical readings in order:
median over all slices,
pooled aggregate,
median over the filtered set.

Read this as a standing warning.
A comment that names a concrete failure is evidence about the code AT THE TIME
IT WAS WRITTEN,
not about the code now.
Re-run the cited failure before letting it veto a change.

### What the exclusion buys, measured

Excluding implausible slices from the baseline set moves 8 documents beyond
what ratio tails alone would move,
and flips 1 outright:
`saurikissa` gaps to 0.87.
That is why `SliceSize` gained required `sourceBlocks` and `targetBlocks`
rather than staying a two-field character record,
and why `sliceSizeOf` became
the single site that counts both.
Both corpus-run probes were repointed at it,
so no caller hand-rolls the shape.

Non-circularity holds and was checked rather than assumed:
every predicate in `slice-implausible.ts` reads FIXED endpoints
(`IMPLAUSIBLE_MIN_RATIO` 0.8,
`IMPLAUSIBLE_MAX_RATIO` 10,
`MAX_BLOCK_COUNT_GAP` 1) and never reads the baseline it helps compute.

### Agreement and downstream effect

Implementation against prototype:
89 of 89 exact agreement,
0 disagreements,
re-confirmed after the barrel split with byte-identical output.

Old build against new build,
over the whole corpus:
the baseline moves by more than 0.01 in 77 of 92 entries and its source flips
in 7,
but `relocationCandidates` changes in only 3 entries,
+6 and -0.
The mechanism was settled rather than inferred:
no high slice is ever GAINED,
`windward0032` loses high slice 17,
and every
gain is donor-side,
because a higher baseline enlarges every ordinary slice's
deficit.

### Structural notes

`translate-barrel.ts` hit 301 lines against the 300 limit.
Fixed by extracting `displacement-barrel.ts`,
NOT by disabling the rule and
NOT by moving lines into whichever neighbouring file had room.

`stylistic(chain-per-line)` rejected `sliceImplausibility({ slice, },).length`.
Splitting the chain across lines did not satisfy it;
naming an intermediate `const reasons` removed the chain and the finding.

GFP performed on the exclusion test:
removing `isPlausibleSlice` from the filter,
rebuilding and running failed it
with `actual: 'corpus-reference', expected: 'document'`.
Restored with `git checkout --` and rebuilt green.
The guard was committed BEFORE the removal,
so the restore discarded nothing.

Gate at the commit:
lint 0 warnings and 0 errors,
types exit 0,
build exit 0,
suite 527 PASS,
0 FAIL,
exit 0.

### Commit B is blocked on a collision, not on effort

The plan was two named faults in `contest-ballot-wire.ts`,
one per tail
direction,
following `#155`'s policy-line mechanism.
The SHORTER direction is safe:
a candidate at 0.4x its source is missing
Chinese content whatever the archive did.
The LONGER direction collides with `#155` itself.
`CONTEST_POLICY` already tells judges that where the Chinese is silent rather
than contradicting,
KEEPING page-only content is correct.
A candidate that preserves a long page-only region is far-longer against the
Chinese AND is the right candidate,
so a bare fault name would instruct the
judge to penalise the exact behaviour `#155` protects.
That is the shape of `#143`,
a criterion licensing the wrong outcome.

Two resolutions,
to be chosen by measurement rather than taste:
gate far-longer on the candidate also exceeding the ARCHIVE's ratio,
or drop
the fault label in that direction and give judges the three numbers plus a
policy paragraph teaching the reading.
The second is what `DNL` prefers,
since a name that fires on correct
preservation asserts a fault that is not one.

## 2026-08-22, `#163` Commit B: the planned fault was refuted by its own measurement, and became evidence

Commits `2008ccc17`,
`bef5cba5c`,
`77294edd6`.
Both contests now carry a size note when one rendering of a passage is far out
of proportion to its Chinese,
and `CONTEST_POLICY` carries a reading for each
direction.
Neither direction carries a fault name.

### What the plan was, and why it could not be built

`#163` planned two named faults in `contest-ballot-wire.ts`,
one per tail
direction,
following the mechanism `#155` established.
The far-longer name contradicts the policy it would have joined.
`CONTEST_POLICY` already tells judges that where the Chinese is SILENT rather
than contradicting,
KEEPING page-only content is correct,
and it already
carries the sentence "A passage the Chinese states in one line can stand beside
a page region the archive spells out at length,
and the shorter candidate is
the one that lost something."
A candidate preserving such a region is far longer than the Chinese AND is the
right candidate.
Naming that a fault instructs a judge to penalise the exact behaviour `#155`
protects,
which is the shape of the criterion `#143` removed.

### The free measurement that settled it

Run over all 11 settled artifacts rather than buying a roster sample.
Ratios are computable without touching a passage,
because each artifact carries
`alignment.sourceCodePoints` and `incumbentCodePoints` per slice and the
candidates' own lengths.
184 rows,
116 eligible after the 80-character floor,
zero astral characters so
code points and UTF-16 units coincide.

  - Translate lane:
    0 trips in 58,
    ratios p05 1.00,
    median 3.03,
    max 4.59.
  - Repair lane:
    2 trips in 58,
    both on slices the lane returned unchanged.
  - Slices any lane PRODUCED:
    0 trips of 92.
    Repair-changed reaches 9.27
    against a 10 endpoint;
    translate-changed never passes 4.59.

So the endpoints transfer to this population,
and the thin 9.27 margin is a
second argument against a fault name rather than a reason to move an endpoint.

The proposal to gate far-longer on the candidate also exceeding the archive's
ratio is REFUTED:
at 100% of far-longer trips the candidate IS the archive,
so
such a gate could never fire.

### The two trips are page-only content, established without reading a passage

Attempting to print the passages was blocked,
which was correct,
and the
structural answer is better evidence.
Displacement implies a DONOR:
another slice whose source is large and whose
target is starved.
Profiling each whole document by size found none.

  - `dogesir_` slice 3:
    source 114,
    archive 1766,
    so 15.49 times,
    against a
    document running 2.75,
    with every other slice between 0.88 and 6.10.
  - `wangzihao980` slice 4 is the same shape just under the endpoint:
    source
    141,
    archive 1228,
    8.71 times,
    document 2.66.
  - `wangzihao980` slice 3 is the far-shorter trip:
    source 102,
    archive 66,
    0.65 times,
    where the archive genuinely under-renders the Chinese.

Both artifacts record `laneSelection` kind `pending-human-decision` and predate
`#155` and the contest,
so this measures lane outputs.
Lane outputs are what the contest judges,
so the population is the right one.

### What shipped instead

Evidence,
in `contest-size-note.ts`,
plus `SIZE_NOTE_POLICY` joined into
`CONTEST_POLICY`.
The two readings `#163` wanted from two names are carried by the policy:
far
shorter asks the judge to put the DROPPED question to that rendering;
far longer
opens two readings and says the surplus text decides,
naming the DROPPED-ALSO
rule for the page-only case and unsupported for the contradicting one.

Three threading decisions,
each made by measurement rather than taste:

1.  No document baseline.
    `PLAUSIBLE_BASELINE_MIN` 1.9 and
    `PLAUSIBLE_BASELINE_MAX` 4.5 sit strictly inside the 0.8 and 10 endpoints,
    so an absolute tail is already outside every norm the estimator accepts.
    Reading the baseline could not change whether a note appears.
2.  No verse marker.
    A fault name would have needed one,
    because verse expands
    unusually and a judge told "this is a fault" cannot discount it.
    The policy
    instead states outright that size settles neither reading and names verse as
    a reason a large ratio can be innocent.
3.  No cache version bump,
    following the precedent of every prior
    `CONTEST_POLICY` edit:
    `5de9d9085`,
    `8471664b7` and `d5407f7b4` all changed
    the policy and left `LANE_CONTEST_CACHE_VERSION` alone.
    Bumping would re-buy
    every cached ballot to deliver a note to the 1.7 percent of eligible slices
    that trip one.

The trigger calls the shipped instrument,
`sliceSizeOf` plus
`sliceImplausibility`,
rather than re-deriving a ratio,
so the note and the
baseline filter can never drift apart.
`block-count-gap` is excluded deliberately:
it describes the PAIRING rather
than the rendering,
and it was the sole cause for 20 of 36 flagged slices.

### Verification

Suite 531 PASS,
0 FAIL,
exit 0.
Lint 0 warnings and 0 errors,
types exit 0,
build exit 0.

GFP on the block-gap exclusion:
replacing the ratio-reason filter with a bare
emptiness check,
rebuilding and running failed exactly one test,
"SAYS NOTHING
for a block-count gap on its own",
with `expected 'SIZE NOTE for this
passage...' to equal ''`.
Restored and rebuilt green.

The `~10`-entry roster sample `#163` planned is SUPERSEDED rather than owed.
Its question was the false-fire rate,
now answered at 0 of 92 produced
candidates with an upper bound near 3 percent,
and ten random entries would
contain approximately no tails at all,
since 2 of 11 entries carry one.

## 2026-08-22 late: the ballot reader is built and both tail preconditions reproduce

The `#163` boundary verification is waiting on a live pass,
so the instrument it
needs was built and validated against settled artifacts first.
It is `${HOME}/temp/agent/163-ballots.mjs`,
and it answers the precondition
question before the ballot question,
because a slice where the note never fires
verifies nothing.

WHAT IT READS.
Ballots live at `.laneSelection.slices[].ballots[]`,
each
carrying `choice`,
`unsupported`,
`dropped`,
`unsupportedRaw`,
`droppedRaw` and
`reason`.
The three renderings come from `.comparison[]` as `incumbentText`,
`repairText`
and `translateText`,
and the Chinese from `.lanes.repair.delivery[].sourceText`,
matched by `chunkIndex`.
Artifacts settled before `laneSelection` existed still carry `comparison`,
so
the reader falls back to it and reports geometry without ballots,
which is what
made the two known tail entries readable at all.

IT REBUILDS THE REAL NOTE RATHER THAN A LOOKALIKE.
It imports `contestSizeNote`
from `dist/final/node/index.mjs` and passes the same three labels
`lane-contest-wire.ts` passes,
so "did the note fire" is the pipeline's answer.
Judge prose never reaches stdout:
ids,
character counts,
ratios,
tail names,
verdict kinds and ballot enums only,
with `reason` and the raw arrays written to
`<runsDir>/163-ballot-detail.json`.

VALIDATED BEFORE IT WAS TRUSTED,
because its first real result was a null:
17
slices across 6 entries of `vub-run1-20260821`,
0 notes fired.

-   Synthetic positive control on invented text,
    a 96-character original
    against a 2250-character rendering:
    `target-far-longer` at 23.44 times,
    and
    against a 15-character one,
    `target-far-shorter` at 0.16.
    The note fires and
    the reader reports FIRED,
    so the null is a real absence.
-   Three figures recorded in `contest-size-note.ts` before this reader existed
    reproduce exactly:
    `dogesir_` slice 3 at 15.49 times,
    its neighbours across
    0.88 to 6.10,
    and a produced ratio of 9.27 against the 10 endpoint,
    which
    turns out to be `wangzihao980` slice 4.

BOTH PRECONDITIONS HOLD on `translation-repair-runs-flagged-20260818`:

-   `dogesir_` slice 3:
    Chinese 114 characters,
    archive and repair both 1766 at
    15.49 times,
    translate 215 at 1.89.
    Tails `target-far-longer` and
    `block-count-gap`.
    Repair equals the archive byte for byte,
    which is the
    documented trip condition:
    every tail is a lane handing back the archive.
-   `wangzihao980` slice 3:
    Chinese 102 characters,
    archive and repair both 66
    at 0.65 times,
    translate 184 at 1.80.
    Tail `target-far-shorter`.

WHAT A CORRECT BALLOT LOOKS LIKE,
read off `SIZE_NOTE_POLICY` rather than
invented for the occasion.
At `dogesir_` slice 3 the surplus is page content the
Chinese is silent about,
so the DROPPED-ALSO rule governs and the SHORTER
candidate is the one that lost something:
judges should put `translate` in
`dropped` and keep the long rendering.
At `wangzihao980` slice 3 the archive and
repair are far shorter,
so the DROPPED question goes to them in particular.

THE LIVE RUN MAY NOT REPRODUCE THE SLICING.
These figures are the 08-18 run's,
and `#131`,
`#157` and `#159` all changed pairing since.
If the live pass slices
either document differently,
or the repair lane changes slice 3 instead of
returning the archive,
no note fires there and the run verifies nothing.
That is
a finding to record,
not a failed verification,
and the reader reports it as
`note=silent` rather than as a judge ignoring evidence.

### toBeInstanceOf was never shown able to fail, and now has been

Every conversion `#127` landed rests on `toBeInstanceOf`,
and no failure of that
matcher had been observed this session:
every failure seen was `toBe` or a scope
error.
A broken-permissive matcher would have made all 25 class conversions pass
identically,
so the family was resting on an unvalidated probe.

Controlled in both forms,
against committed files,
restored afterwards with
`git checkout --`:

-   Async,
    `runs-lock.unit.test.ts:94`,
    `RunsDirectoryBusyError` to `TypeError`:
    FAIL,
    exit 1,
    `expected RunsDirectoryBusyError... to be an instance of
    TypeError`.
-   Sync,
    `pipeline-digest.unit.test.ts:277`,
    `TypeError` to `RangeError`:
    FAIL,
    `expected TypeError... to be an instance of RangeError`.

Both files pass again after restore.
This supersedes any plan to revert a source
error class and rebuild to prove the same thing:
each converted file already
runs against real `dist`,
and one wrong-class failure closes the gap for the
whole family without a build.

### What is actually available while the pass runs, and what is not

Checked against the tracker rather than assumed,
because the obvious next item
turned out to be blocked in the opposite direction from the one expected.

-   `#98` records `Blocked by: #106`,
    not the reverse,
    and its own fix order
    says not to route the equal-count fast path through the current aligner
    just to route it:
    the gate waits until heading scoring gains a signal for
    handle-free headings.
-   `#106` blocks `#98` and `#100`,
    and ends with an explicit instruction not
    to wire `groupSourceFirst` into `subdivideChunkPair` nor emit insertion
    pairs from `alignDocumentSections` until the user answers question 28 in
    `doc/planning/translation-repair-open-decisions.md`.
-   `#106` also must not start while a pass holds the roster,
    which the live
    verification run does.
-   `#94` is held with `#100` for a stated reason that still holds:
    `#100`
    changes what `alignmentPairCount` means,
    which is the denominator confusion
    the rename exists to prevent,
    so renaming first means renaming twice.

So the alignment cluster is gated on a USER DECISION,
not on the build.
Nothing
in it should be started unasked.

### Run-exit protocol, in order

Ballots outrank the build,
because the run is the perishable thing.

1.  `node ${HOME}/temp/agent/163-ballots.mjs ${HOME}/temp/agent/163b-verify`.
    The sharp question is whether the new slicing still produces a slice 3
    where the repair lane returns the archive.
    If it does not,
    no note fires
    and the run verifies nothing,
    which is a finding rather than a failure.
2.  `mise run //package/module/translation-repair:build`,
    which only becomes
    safe once the pass has exited.
3.  `mise run //package/module/translation-repair:test:unit`,
    to confirm the
    baseline holds with the nine classes `56ba8f1dd` added.
4.  The 24 of `#127`,
    per `${HOME}/temp/agent/127-step2-mapping.txt`:
    convert,
    run each file with `node <file>`,
    then `test:unit` again.
    Never run
    `test:unit` before the build;
    it declares no `depends` and passes vacuously
    against a stale `dist`.

## 2026-08-23: #157 removed the far-longer case #163's note was built to catch

OVERREACHED,
corrected later the same day.
The measurement in this section is sound;
the conclusion it licensed was not.
See "2026-08-23:
the far-longer tail is alive,
and the note's own floor is why nobody saw it".
