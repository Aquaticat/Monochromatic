## The probe's blindness, measured 2026-08-12

Task `#66` asked for the introduced-defect probe's false-NEGATIVE rate.
Measured over all 857 distinct probed regions in the 56 settled artifacts of
 `node_modules/.monochromatic/translation-repair-runs/artifacts`:

```text
prober verdicts        2571  = 857 regions x 3 probers, exactly
no-introduced-defect   2438  (94.8 percent)
corroborated             86
removal-corroborated     40
contradicted              2
unanchored                3
uncertain                 2
regions where every prober found nothing   743 of 857 (86.7 percent)
```

### Three causes eliminated, so they do not get re-investigated

Lost prober voices absorbed into `noneFound`.
NO:
all 2626 recorded probe blocks read 3/3 heard,
and the verdict total is
 exactly three per region,
so no region is missing a voice.

The deterministic screen erasing true claims before they are recorded.
NO:
every one of the 131 raised claims persists in the artifact with its
 `admissibility`,
and only 5 were rejected,
2 contradicted and 3 unanchored.
`screenIntroducedDefects` is not where the damage disappears.

The sensitivity control being unrepresentative in size or issue count.
NO:
production regions have median `before` length 55 characters,
p90 115,
and
 median 1 issue per region,
p90 7.
The `OMITTING_REGION` fixture is 82 characters with 1 issue,
inside both
 distributions.

### What survives

The probers genuinely cast `no-introduced-defect-found`,
and their raise rate
 barely moves with how much text the edit removed:

```text
regions deleting over half their text   0.060
regions at 0.50 to 0.80 of before       0.057
regions at 0.80 to 1.20                 0.032
regions that grew                       0.066
```

A probe that could see removal damage would show a steep gradient there.
It shows none,
which is the signature of an instrument whose output does not
 depend on its input.

### Live hypothesis, and the experiment built for it

Each region reaches the prober with its accepted issues rendered under
 `PRE-EXISTING DEFECTS THIS EDIT TARGETED (these are NOT your findings)`,
and
 the rules forbid reporting one.
When an accepted issue is a FALSE POSITIVE calling source-supported content an
 unsupported addition,
the editor deletes that content and the prober is told
 the deletion was the repair.
The damage is then invisible by construction,
which would put probe blindness
 DOWNSTREAM of detection precision rather than in the probe.

`probe-sensitivity` gained a labelling arm that holds the deletion fixed and
 moves only the label,
cat fixtures only,
in
 `src/corpus-run/probe-sensitivity-input.ts`:

-   `deletion/unlabelled` deletes source-supported text,
    prior issue unrelated.
     A working probe reports damage.
-   `deletion/mislabelled` deletes byte-identical text,
    prior issue falsely
     calls it an addition.
    A working probe still reports damage,
    because the
     prober is shown the original.
-   `deletion/licensed` deletes content the original genuinely lacks,
    truthfully
     labelled.
    Silence is correct,
    and a claim here would disqualify the probe
     as a gate.

A gap between the first two measures how far a false accepted issue can talk the
 probe out of seeing real damage.

### Consequence for the re-plan if the hypothesis holds

`#66` stops being a separate defect and becomes a second symptom of the
 precision gap,
and the planning document's proposal to separate repair SAFETY
 from QUALITY needs the deterministic preservation check to carry the safety
 verdict,
since no model-based probe can be trusted while it is fed accepted
 issues as ground truth.

### The labelling arm ran, and it refutes the hypothesis it was built for

```text
deletion/unlabelled   prior = unrelated issue        3/3 removal-corroborated
deletion/mislabelled  prior = FALSE addition claim   2/3 removal-corroborated, 1 none
deletion/licensed     prior = TRUE addition claim    3/3 none, which is correct
```

Read them in order.
The probe DOES see a deleted clause the source supports.
A false accepted issue naming that clause costs exactly one voice of three,
so
 the labelling effect is real and modest rather than silencing.
The negative control is perfect,
and it is the one that matters most:
the probe
 stays quiet when the deletion really is licensed,
so it is reading the original
 rather than flagging every deletion.

So probe blindness is NOT simply downstream of detection precision.
That was the leading hypothesis and the measurement does not support it.

Two other candidate explanations died in the same pass:

-   Region count per call.
    Production sends one region per call in 848 of 854
     calls,
    which is exactly what the fixture sends.
-   Prior-issue count.
    Raise rate rises slightly with more listed issues,
    0.044
     at one issue to 0.061 at six or more,
    which is the wrong direction for a
     list that silences.

### What is left, and it is now a narrow question

The fixture damage is a clean clause deletion with a verbatim span present in
 BEFORE and absent from AFTER.
Production damage is usually a compression or rewrite,
and judging it needs the
 cross-lingual question of whether the deleted English was licensed by Chinese
 prose elsewhere.
The probe scores 3/3 on the first and near zero on the second.

Probers also disagree enormously about how often anything is worth raising,
 measured across 857 regions each:

```text
hf:openai/gpt-oss-120b                    81 claims   rate 0.095
hf:nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B    45 claims   rate 0.053
hf:Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B                        5 claims   rate 0.006
```

Qwen raised claims on both blatant fixtures,
so it is not broken;
it is far more
 conservative than the other two on real edits,
and a third of the ensemble
 contributing almost nothing drags a majority-of-three toward silence.

### Next action for `#66`

Re-probe the specific regions a human graded as damaged,
once with their
 accepted issues shown and once with them withheld.
That is the only remaining way to tell whether production damage is invisible
 because it is subtle or because the label suppresses it,
and unlike the cat
 fixtures it uses cases already known to be damaged.

### The paired re-probe on real damaged regions, and a correction

The cat fixtures said the labelling effect was modest,
one voice of three.
On
 the regions a human actually read as damaged it is total.
Five distinct regions,
rebuilt from the eight drawn positions,
each probed twice
 with the same three probers:

```text
entry              positions      issues  shown            withheld
Acheron            2+7+11+15      8       0 raised, 3 none  1 removal, 1 unanchored, 1 none
Anilovr            20             6       0 raised, 3 none  1 corroborated, 1 removal, 1 none
AmbeR_the_anpa     21             8       0 raised, 3 none  2 removal, 1 none
Chinatsu_Suzuki    37             7       0 raised, 3 none  1 corroborated, 2 none
Dethelly           43            17       0 raised, 3 none  1 removal, 2 none
```

With the accepted issues shown,
0 of 15 prober verdicts raised anything.
With them withheld,
7 of 15 raised,
and every one of the five regions drew at
 least one admissible claim.

So the earlier reading from the fixtures,
that probe blindness is not downstream
 of detection precision,
was WRONG,
and the fixture is why.
It carried ONE prior issue.
These regions carry six to seventeen,
and a region
 whose every part is labelled a known defect has nothing left that a deletion
 could damage.
The prompt conflates two instructions:
do not re-report the old defect,
and
 treat everything here as already accounted for.

### What that does NOT yet establish

Withholding the list is not obviously the fix.
The list exists because a prober shown a defective region reports the defect it
 was cut for,
and the withheld arm may be doing exactly that rather than finding
 the damage.
Nothing here separates those,
because all five regions are damaged by
 construction,
so there is no case where a raised claim would be wrong.

The missing measurement is a CONTROL:
regions from the same entries that the
 reader did NOT flag,
probed under both arms.
If the withheld arm raises claims
 just as often there,
it is re-reporting pre-existing defects and its 7 of 15 is
 worthless.
If it stays quiet there,
the label is suppressing real detections
 and the stage can be fixed.

### The shape a fix would take, if the control holds

`screenNonTranslationVotes` is the precedent:
deterministic evidence DISMISSES a
 claim rather than a prompt preventing it.
The same split applies here.
Let the
 prober run without the excusing list,
then discard deterministically any claim
 whose quoted wording falls inside a pre-existing issue's evidence span.
That
 keeps the defence against re-reporting the old defect while removing the
 blanket licence that currently silences the stage.

### The over-replacement statistic, re-derived on distinct regions

The round-three draw of 50 items sits on 40 DISTINCT regions;
six regions were
 drawn more than once.
Measuring each region's replaced text against the target-side span quoted by the
 issue that drew it:

```text
over 1.35x the DRAWN issue's span     13 of 40 regions   (19 of 50 items)
over 1.35x the WIDEST served span      0 of 40 regions
```

The second line is the one that matters,
and it is why `#67`'s framing was
 wrong.
An envelope merges OVERLAPPING and TOUCHING target-side evidence,
so a region is
 cut to cover every issue it serves,
and comparing its replacement against ONE
 of those issues measures the merge rather than the editor.
Against the widest span the region actually serves,
nothing over-replaces.

The comparison is conservative in the direction that matters.
The widest single
 served span is never longer than the union of the served spans,
so a union
 denominator would be larger,
the ratios smaller,
and the count still zero.

So the editor is not replacing far more text than the defect it was given:
it is
 replacing the envelope it was given,
and the envelope legitimately spans several
 accepted issues.
What remains true,
and is a different fault,
is that some of those replacements
 DROP source-supported content,
which is what the probe work is about.
The width
 of a replacement was never evidence of that,
and reading it as evidence pointed
 `#67` at the wrong stage.

### The control arm, run 002

Fifteen regions,
five a human read as damaged and ten unflagged from the same
 entries,
each probed with the accepted issues shown and again with them
 withheld:

```text
arm                regions  admissible verdicts  regions flagged
damaged/shown         5          0 of 15             0 of 5
damaged/withheld      5          5 of 15             4 of 5
control/shown        10          0 of 30             0 of 10
control/withheld     10          3 of 30             2 of 10
```

Two things follow,
and the first is larger than the question the run was built
 to answer.

The SHOWN arm is zero everywhere.
Across 45 verdicts covering damaged and
 undamaged regions alike,
the production configuration raised nothing at all.
A
 stage that answers identically whether or not damage is present carries no
 information,
which is a stronger statement than "it misses things".

The WITHHELD arm discriminates.
Four of five damaged regions drew an admissible
 claim against two of ten controls,
and 5 of 15 verdicts against 3 of 30.
That
 is a detector with signal rather than a prober re-reporting whatever defect it
 is shown,
which was the reading the control existed to rule out.

Run-to-run spread is real and worth carrying:
the damaged withheld arm gave 7 of
 15 in run 001 and 5 of 15 in run 002 on identical inputs,
while the shown arm
 gave 0 of 15 both times.
Five regions is a small denominator and the withheld
 rate should be read as a band,
not a point.

CAVEAT,
and it is why run 003 exists:
run 002's controls were NOT matched on
 replaced length,
and the gap is measured rather than suspected.

```text
damaged  n=5   60, 79, 99, 189, 268                          median  99, mean 139.0
control  n=10  12, 14, 32, 32, 41, 54, 63, 69, 69, 316       median  41, mean  70.2
```

Seven of the ten controls replaced less text than the SMALLEST damaged region,
 and a shorter replacement has less room to drop anything,
so the control's
 quiet is partly a statement about length.
An earlier note in this document gave the control range as 12 to 63 characters;
 that was read off the first four lines before the run finished,
and the full
 range is 12 to 316.
Control selection now orders unflagged regions by distance from the damaged
 region's replaced length in the same entry,
which removes the gap by
 construction rather than hoping it does not matter.

### Whether length-matched controls exist at all, per entry

Measured over every distinct edited region each entry has,
with the damaged
 region's own length shown for comparison and itself excluded from the pool:

```text
entry             damaged  pool  nearest available
Acheron              189      3  32, 12
Anilovr               99     20  95, 120
AmbeR_the_anpa        60     13  61, 51
Chinatsu_Suzuki       79     10  84, 62
Dethelly             268     52  316, 149
```

Four of the five entries match closely.
Acheron cannot be matched at all:
the
 whole entry carries three edited regions,
and once its damaged 189-character
 region is excluded the only candidates are 32 and 12 characters.

So run 003's control arm is well matched except for one entry,
and that entry's
 pair is a known exception rather than a silent weakness.
Excluding Acheron,
the
 controls run 51 to 316 characters against damaged regions of 60 to 268,
where
 run 002's controls had a median of 41 against a damaged median of 99.

### Pooled over three relabel runs, and a correction to "zero"

```text
arm                verdicts  admissible  rate   regions flagged
damaged/shown           45        2      0.044      2 of 15
damaged/withheld        45       18      0.400     14 of 15
control/shown           48        1      0.021      1 of 17
control/withheld        48        6      0.125      4 of 17
```

Correction first.
Runs 001 and 002 both gave 0 of 15 on the damaged shown arm,
 and that was recorded here as the production configuration raising nothing at
 all.
Run 003 gave 2 of 15 on identical inputs,
so the shown arm is not zero;
it
 is 3 admissible claims across 93 verdicts spanning both damaged and unflagged
 regions.
The substantive reading survives and is sharper with the extra run:
shown
 separates damaged from unflagged by 0.044 against 0.021,
on two claims against
 one,
while withheld separates them by 0.400 against 0.125.
Withholding the
 issue list raises the damaged rate ninefold and flags 14 of 15 damaged regions
 against 4 of 17 unflagged ones.

### The limit that decides whether this can gate anything

"Unflagged" is not "verified clean".
The controls were never read by anyone:
the
 human read 50 drawn items,
and these regions were not among them.
So the 0.125
 control rate bounds the false-positive rate only if those regions are actually
 undamaged,
which nothing establishes.

The cheap way to settle it is four items.
Exactly four control regions drew an
 admissible claim in the withheld arm,
and a human reading only those four says
 whether the withheld arm is finding damage nobody had looked at or inventing
 it.
That is a far smaller ask than another 50-item sheet and it is the last
 thing standing between this result and a gating decision.

### The prompt-to-screen move, and the limit it does NOT remove

The probe now withholds the accepted issues from the prober and dismisses a
 claim deterministically when its quoted wording restates one.
Measured on the
 labelling fixtures,
with the guard proven live by removing it:

```text
fixture                guard present            guard removed
deletion/unlabelled    3/3 removal-corroborated 3/3 removal-corroborated
deletion/mislabelled   3/3 PRE-EXISTING         3/3 removal-corroborated
deletion/licensed      3/3 none found           3/3 none found
```

The middle row is the finding,
and it is not the one the change was hoping for.
`deletion/mislabelled` deletes source-supported text under a FALSE accepted
issue naming that text.
All three probers detect the deletion,
and the screen
dismisses all three,
because the wording they quote is exactly the wording the
false issue complained about.

So moving the defence from the prompt to the screen did NOT recover detection of
 damage a false accepted issue licenses.
A deterministic check cannot:
it can
 see that a claim restates an accepted issue,
and it has no way to know whether
 that issue was right.

What the move does buy is real but narrower.
The claim is now RAISED,
SCREENED
 and RECORDED with its quoted text and its reason,
marked `pre-existing`,
where
 before the prompt stopped it being made at all and the region reported
 `noneFound`.
A count of dismissals is a measurement;
silence was not.
The
 `pre-existing` tally is now the visible price of every accepted issue the
 detector got wrong,
which ties repair safety directly to detection precision
 rather than leaving the link invisible.

`deletion/licensed` also deserves a caveat:
the probers reported nothing there
 under both conditions,
so that control passes without the screen ever being
 exercised.
It shows the probe is not flagging every deletion;
it does not show
 the screen dismisses correctly.

### Re-anchoring the question emptied the sheet, and reading the five explains why

Under the source-anchored prompt,
`probe-verify` wrote ZERO items:
44 of 45
 prober verdicts found nothing and the remaining one was unanchored.
The screen
 dismissed nothing,
so this is the probers themselves,
not the filter.

That looked like an over-correction until the five regions were read against the
 Chinese.
They are not damaged.
Each judged against the ORIGINAL rather than
 against the pre-edit English:

-   Acheron.
    Source:
    她在技术领域也颇有研究，曾经发过...视频。The BEFORE text adds
     "not just a gamer",
    "from hardware to software" and "shared her insights
     with the community",
    none of which the source says.
    The AFTER renders
     在技术领域也颇有研究 and drops the additions.
    The hi3861 video sentence is
     untranslated in BOTH texts,
    so the edit did not delete it.
    The earlier note
     in this document saying it did was wrong.
-   Anilovr.
    The BEFORE text reverses the source's sentence order and adds "On
     that day".
    The AFTER restores the order and drops the addition.
-   AmbeR_the_anpa.
    Source line is 条目贡献：UP 主纪念馆（...）with no "Bilibi".
     The BEFORE text carries "Bilibi - ";
    removing it is correct.
-   Chinatsu_Suzuki.
    Source:
    又像是哭诉又像是哀求。哀求 is PLEADING.
    The BEFORE
     text said "reminiscing",
    which is simply wrong,
    and the AFTER says
     "pleading".
    The edit fixed a mistranslation.
-   Dethelly.
    Source:
    私信里编号式地问上十几个问题。编号式地 IS "in numbered form"
     and 私信里 IS "via private messages".
    The earlier note calling those
     inventions was wrong;
    they are in the source,
    and the AFTER also restores a
     whole first half the BEFORE text omitted.

So all five are correct repairs,
and a probe reporting no introduced defect on
 them is RIGHT.

### What that overturns

The damaged set was never ground truth.
It was assembled by reading edits
 against the previous English,
which is the same reference error the prompt
 made,
so "the repairs are too broken to grade" rests on five items that read as
 damage only from that angle.

Every probe figure taken before the re-anchoring measured change rather than
 damage,
including 0.400 against 0.150 and 14 of 15.
They are withdrawn.

`#67`'s surviving half,
that the editor drops source-supported content,
now has
 no evidence behind it.
The one omission found in these five predates the edit.

What is NOT established:
that repairs are fine generally.
Five regions from four
 entries were read,
all drawn because someone thought they were bad,
and the
 probe agreeing with a re-reading of the same five is not a measurement of the
 corpus.
A fresh sample judged against the source is.

### An invisible character was misaligning a document, and no stage could see it

Found by READING the drawn damage sheet,
not by any measurement.

`people/Toka_ls/page.en.md` carries three lines holding U+FEFF and nothing else.
Verified with `parseDocument`:
such a line becomes its own paragraph node,
so
the translation has a block the original lacks and every paragraph after it
pairs with the WRONG source paragraph.

The drawn item shows what follows.
The source slice began at 期盼中 while the
 target slice began two paragraphs earlier,
and the editor,
mapping them
 positionally,
replaced a correct rendering of 期盼中，她看见光穿透暗影 with a
 faithful rendering of 尽管前路漫布荆棘,
a sentence three lines away.

Nothing downstream can catch that.
Both texts are fluent,
both translate
 something the source really says,
and the critics,
the checkers and the probe
 are all comparing against whatever paragraph the misalignment handed them.
A
 source-anchored probe does not help,
because the source it is anchored to is
 the wrong paragraph.

Fixed in `buildDocumentNodes`:
a block whose every character is whitespace or
 invisible is dropped.
Filtering runs AFTER the map so a surviving node keeps
 the index it had among the parser's children,
because accepted issues anchor to
 `block/N` and renumbering would repoint every claim recorded against an earlier
 parse.

Guard proven by removal:
with the filter disabled the fixture parses to three
 nodes instead of two and ids read `block/0, block/1, block/2` instead of
 `block/0, block/2`.
Restored and green.

Scope:
one entry of the corpus carries the character,
and that entry was drawn
 three times into the twenty-item sample,
so up to three of those items sat on a
 misaligned pairing.
The sample is being redrawn.

### Correction: the invisible character WELDS paragraphs, it does not split them

The entry above this one described a lone U+FEFF becoming its own paragraph.
That is what a fixture with blank lines either side does,
and it is not the
shape the corpus contains.
The corpus shape has ordinary sentences directly
above and below with no blank line,
and a line carrying a byte-order mark is not
blank to CommonMark,
so it reads as a CONTINUATION and merges the two
paragraphs into one block.

```text
REAL shape   (mark line, no blank lines around it)   1 block   two paragraphs MERGED
fixture I wrote (blank lines around it)              2 blocks
plain blank line                                     2 blocks
```

So that translation parsed to 29 blocks against the original's 33.
They track
 one-to-one to index 9,
and after the first weld every English block pairs with
 the wrong Chinese one,
which is how a correct rendering of 期盼中，她看见光穿透暗影
 was rewritten into a faithful rendering of 尽管前路漫布荆棘,
two blocks away.

The first fix dropped invisible-ONLY blocks,
a shape the corpus never produces.
It has been removed rather than kept:
a guard that cannot fire reads as
protection that is not there.
The real fix blanks such a line to spaces before
parsing,
preserving length exactly as `maskHtmlComments` does,
because node
text,
quotes,
hashes and claim anchors are all sliced by absolute offset.

After the fix that document reads 33 against 32 and the slice pairs correctly:

```text
期盼中，她看见光穿透暗影…      In her anticipation, she saw the light…
在心灵最深处…                  In the deepest recesses of the soul…
尽管前路漫布荆棘…              Despite the thorns that litter the path…
或许她的世界里…                Perhaps in her world, the light is…
```

### Two traps worth keeping

ECMAScript counts U+FEFF as WHITESPACE,
so `'\u{FEFF}'.trim()` is empty and a
 whitespace-first check skips the character it is hunting.
The first draft of
 the masker blanked nothing for exactly that reason.

A guard proven by removal proves the guard RUNS.
It does not prove the guard
 addresses the defect,
because the fixture came from the hypothesis rather than
 from the corpus.
Both the removal proof and the test passed while the corpus
 case went untouched.

### The drift figure re-measured

`#69` was recorded against the broken parser and flagged as suspect.
Re-measured
 with the fix:
60 of 172 aligned pairs differ in block count,
against 61 before,
 so the welding accounted for exactly ONE pair.
The premise stands and the
 largest gaps are unchanged,
including a section with 76 source blocks against
 5 target blocks.

### What one entry's section alignment actually looks like

`XingZ60`,
rebuilt with the corrected parser.
Thirteen aligned section pairs,
 source against target,
in blocks and characters:

```

Pair 3 is the sharpest case in the corpus so far.
Its entire English side is the
 string `## Memories by Friends`:
a heading with 4641 characters of memorial
 essay untranslated beneath it.
The pipeline treats that as a translation with
 defects in it.

The gap runs BOTH ways,
which the earlier framing missed.
Pair 7 holds 613
 characters of original against 9551 of translation,
and pair 5 holds 2908
 against 14080.
A translation five to fifteen times its original is not
 explained by English being wordier than Chinese,
so either those sections carry
 content the original does not,
or section alignment is pairing the wrong ones.
Neither has been established,
and the artifacts cannot settle it because they
 were written before the parser fix.

This matters for `#70` beyond the untranslated case:
a re-design premised on
 "translate what is missing" answers pair 3 and pair 10,
and says nothing about
 pair 7.
Whatever shape is proposed has to state what it does when the
 translation carries far MORE than the original.

### XingZ60 is not partly untranslated. It is mispaired end to end

Correcting what this document said earlier tonight.
`alignDocumentSections`
 pairs every section of that entry with the WRONG one,
shifted by two:

```text
### 其一：伊良子      || ## Engagement in Trans Aid
### 其二：铃语        || ## Memories by Friends
### 其三：绘都        || ### Irako
### 其四：无常        || ### Lingyu
### 其五：东云        || ### HiYku
### 其六：Mikä       || ### Ann
### 其七：wing       || ### Shinonome
### 其八：白毛 suki   || ### Mikä
### 其九：空白        || ### wing
### 其十：锦心        || ### Baimao suki
## 致曾划过夜空的流星   || ### __
```

The correct pairing is legible from the headings themselves:
其一：伊良子 with
 Irako,
其二：铃语 with Lingyu,
其六：Mikä with Mikä,
其七：wing with wing,
 其八：白毛 suki with Baimao suki.
The English headings carry the romanised
 names outright.

Cause:
the Chinese has 14 headings and the English 12,
missing two sections at
 the END.
Facing 15 source chunks against 13 target chunks,
the aligner reports
 `structure-mismatch` and falls back to aligning PROPORTIONALLY BY CHARACTER
 FRACTION,
which slides everything by two.

### What that invalidates

The section I called the worst untranslated case is not untranslated.
`其二：铃语`
 has a full English rendering in the same file under `### Lingyu`,
four
 occurrences of the name included.
The translate prototype rendered a section
 that was already translated,
so its output demonstrates capability and NOT a
 gap being filled.

For this entry every critic call compared the wrong original against the wrong
 translation,
so every issue filed against it is noise,
every repair damaged
 correct text,
and the probe agreed because it was handed the same wrong source.

The signal existed the whole time.
The artifact carries
 `alignment structure-mismatch` and two `sections-merged` findings,
and an
 earlier measurement in this document counted 5 of 56 entries carrying an
 alignment finding.
Nothing reads them.

### What it means for `#69` and `#70`

Both were premised on sections whose translation covers a fraction of their
 source.
Some of that is real,
and some of it is this.
The block-count gaps
 measured across the corpus,
60 of 172 pairs,
were computed from the same
 possibly-shifted pairing,
so the figure describes alignment quality as much as
 translation coverage.

Fixing alignment now outranks both.
A pipeline that pairs sections wrongly
 cannot be repaired into correctness by any later stage,
and cannot be
 re-designed around either.

## Overnight autonomous stretch, 2026-08-13 (03:20 to 05:00 UTC)

The user was asleep with a standing instruction to keep working,
to land
 certainly-good pipeline changes immediately,
and to restart runs as needed.
24 commits.
Everything below is committed and pushed;
the tree is clean and
 212 test suites pass with lint clean apart from the ignored rule.

### What is running right now

`pass12`,
into `node_modules/.monochromatic/translation-repair-runs-pass12`,
 started 04:35 UTC under every fix listed here EXCEPT the naturalness
 eligibility one.
It settles roughly one entry per 45 minutes,
so a full pass is
 days rather than hours.

`pass10` (3 settled entries,
old pipeline) and `pass11` (nothing settled) were
 stopped.
`pass10`'s artifacts are kept and are a CONSISTENT old-pipeline
 population,
not a mixed one.
Full reasoning in
 `doc/troubleshooting/translation-repair-run-invalidation.md`.

### Four decisions waiting, none blocked on further work

-   `#70` and `#71`,
    the same question.
    Its two genuinely untranslated sections
    need a destination and both available answers are bad:
    an empty target
    produces the unrepairable 915-characters-against-nothing shape,
    and
    skipping contradicts the decided output goal.
    `doc/planning/translation-pipeline-redesign.md`.

    CORRECTED 2026-08-13:
    this entry previously said the section aligner now
    pairs `XingZ60` correctly.
    That is true of `alignHeadings` and FALSE of the
    production path,
    which still merges source sections from the front and
    slides the document by two.
    `alignHeadings` is called by nothing.
    `doc/planning/wire-the-heading-aligner.md`.
-   `#65`,
    the unit precision is denominated in.
    570 of 2650 accepted issues
    share a span with another,
    but every duplicate pair shares one repair
    envelope,
    so the harm is counting rather than wasted work.
    Ranked C > B > A.
    `doc/planning/duplicate-accepted-issues.md`.
-   Naturalness lane reach.
    620 blocks of plain soft-wrapped prose are excluded
    by a `multi-line` check;
    admitting them would triple the lane's reach.
    Ranked B > C > A.
    `doc/planning/naturalness-lane-reach.md`.
-   The damage sheet still wants human grading,
    which `#66` and `#68` both wait
    on.

### The method, because it is the transferable part

`#71` was found because the artifact had recorded `alignment
 structure-mismatch` for weeks and nothing read it.
Treating that as a PATTERN
 rather than an incident is what produced everything else:
census every signal
 the deterministic core emits,
then check whether each is correct and whether
 anything consumes it.

That chain ran end to end.
The census found the footnote graph was wrong about
 10 of its 15 findings;
fixing it made the graph trustworthy;
trusting it
 revealed that 4 of 56 settled repairs had shipped broken footnotes;
those are
 now gated.
Each step was only possible because of the one before.

The second productive question was whether a built feature actually FIRES.
 Typography restoration was wired in and doing almost nothing.
