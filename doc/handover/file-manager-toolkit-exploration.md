# File manager toolkit exploration: Slint, then Qt, then GTK4 (handover)

Cross-session state for choosing the GUI toolkit for a native cross-platform file manager.
The hard constraint is native OS drag-and-drop on a pure Wayland session (KWin), no
XWayland. The fleet is Linux (primary, this KWin machine), macOS (`ssh m1`), Windows
(`ssh x13-win`). This doc is kept live; sections marked "measuring" or "not built" are
updated as work proceeds.

## Status at a glance

- Slint (winit): rejected for this app. No native Wayland DnD; needs a hand-rolled
  `wl_data_device` adapter plus a Slint fork. Painful, and we would own both.
- DECISION (2026-07-08): GTK4 (gtk4-rs) is chosen; Qt (cxx-qt) is out. GTK meets both tiered
  perf targets (60+ fps on the Linux box, 30+ fps on the fanless M1 Air), teardown is clean on
  every platform, and it is the nicer toolkit to work with. Qt is out because its `reuseItems`
  teardown segfault (and `reuseItems` is required for fast scroll) surfaces as a user-visible
  "quit unexpectedly" CrashReporter dialog on macOS (unacceptable, unlike Linux where it exits
  silently), and it missed the 30-fps M1 bar. Decided on Linux + macOS evidence plus the crash;
  Windows is a later verification step for GTK, not a re-opening of the choice.
- Perf targets (set by the user): 60+ fps on the most-performant machine (this Linux box), and
  30+ fps on the weakest (the fanless M1 Air). Not a flat 60-everywhere bar.
- Qt (cxx-qt): rejected. `reuseItems` (required for 60 fps fast scroll) segfaults on teardown;
  on Linux that was a silent on-exit crash we accepted, but on macOS it raises a CrashReporter
  dialog. Verified on m1: `EXC_BAD_ACCESS`/`SIGSEGV` (`KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at 0x8`) in
  `QQmlReusableDelegateModelItemsPool::drain` during engine teardown, with a `.ips` crash
  report written (see `doc/troubleshooting/qt-qml-reuseitems-teardown-segfault.md`). Perf on
  the M1 Air (over RustDesk) oscillated 29-61 fps, dipping below the 30-fps bar. It does build
  and run (native Cocoa window, Rust bridge round-trips), but needs a per-OS `QMAKE` path, the
  Wayland QPA pin dropped, a C++ logging shim, and carries pre-1.0 API churn.
- GTK4 (gtk4-rs): chosen. Native Wayland window, native inbound DnD from Dolphin, virtualized
  list, clean teardown (rc 0, no crash dialog on any platform), all verified, owning nothing.
  Perf meets the targets: steady ~60 fps on the Linux box, and steady ~30-38 fps on the M1 Air
  even under RustDesk's screen-capture penalty (a real local number would be higher), as long
  as thumbnail decode is off the render path (synchronous per-frame decode drops it to ~4 fps).
  On macOS it builds and runs zero-config (no per-OS env), native Cocoa window with the
  virtualized list. On Windows it builds via gvsbuild and GPU-renders once DirectComposition is
  enabled (`GDK_DEBUG=dcomp`), holding a locked 60 fps on the real sparse-board workload on the
  x13-win (see "Windows (x13-win) results").

## Test machines (full specs)

All perf numbers in this doc were produced on these two machines. The tiered targets map to
them: 60+ fps on the Linux desktop (most performant), 30+ fps on the M1 Air (weakest).

Linux (primary, this KWin machine; perf target 60+ fps):

- CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 8700F, 8 cores / 16 threads, boost to ~5.05 GHz.
- GPU: AMD Radeon RX 7600-class (Navi 33, RDNA3 discrete).
- RAM: 64 GB.
- OS: Bazzite 44.20260629 (Kinoite, Fedora 44 atomic / rpm-ostree), kernel
  `7.0.9-ogc3.2.fc44.x86_64`.
- Desktop: KDE Plasma 6.7.1, KWin 6.7.1, Wayland session (no XWayland).
- Display: quad 4K, all four outputs (DP-3, HDMI-A-2, HDMI-A-1, DP-2) at 3840x2160@60 Hz, a
  heavy compositor load that the RX 7600-class GPU still drove at 60 fps in the benchmark.
  Measured on the local session (no remote-desktop overhead).

macOS (`ssh m1`; perf target 30+ fps):

- Model: MacBook Air (`MacBookAir10,1`), Apple M1, fanless.
- CPU: Apple M1, 8 cores (4 performance + 4 efficiency).
- GPU: Apple M1 7-core (base M1 Air), Metal 4.
- RAM: 16 GB.
- Storage: internal SSD 228 GiB (99 GiB free), fragile, so build writes were offloaded to the
  external MacData APFS volume (477 GiB, 222 GiB free) via `CARGO_HOME`, `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`,
  `HOMEBREW_CACHE`; only Homebrew's prefix installs (unavoidable) touched the internal SSD.
- OS: macOS 26.5.2 (build 25F84), Darwin 25.5.0.
- Display: built-in Retina 2560x1600 @ 60 Hz. Measured over a RustDesk remote-desktop session,
  whose screen-capture depresses fps (a real local number would be higher); both toolkits ran
  under this same penalty, so the head-to-head stays fair.

Windows (`ssh x13-win`; no prior fps target, sits between the Linux box and the M1 Air):

- Model: Lenovo ThinkPad X13.
- CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 7840U, 8 cores / 16 threads (Zen 4).
- GPU: AMD Radeon 780M (RDNA3 integrated); Vulkan 1.4.349, AMD proprietary driver 26.6.1;
  display driver 32.0.31019.2002.
- RAM: 32 GB (30.6 GB visible).
- OS: Windows 10 21H2, build 19044.7417.
- Toolchain: Rust nightly `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, Visual Studio Community 2026 (gvsbuild needs
  `--vs-ver vs2026`), gvsbuild 2026.6.0 building GTK 4.22.4 from source, MSYS2 for gvsbuild's
  unix helper tools, Python 3.12 via mise. The app runs from a self-contained bundle (exe plus
  44 GTK DLLs plus glib schemas in one directory, no PATH needed).
- Display: physical display on at 1920x1200; measured over RustDesk. A WebGL/WebGPU browser GPU
  benchmark on the same box over the same RustDesk connection sustained 65 fps (WebGL) and 86 fps
  (WebGPU), 1%-low 36/49, so RustDesk does not depress a well-behaved GPU app; bench dips here
  are the app's own cost, not the remote path.

## Decision criteria (corrected)

What does NOT decide it: styling and native look (out of scope; we style until it aligns);
which toolkit has a flagship file manager (both do, Nautilus is GTK and Dolphin is Qt);
macOS/Windows foreign look and packaging (solvable, complexity is not a blocker); raw
cross-platform reach (both reach all three targets).

What DOES decide it: developer experience, how nice each is to work with, plus passing the
build-and-run gate. Two more factors surfaced during the macOS gate and became decisive: the
teardown-crash behavior (silent on Linux, a user-visible crash dialog on macOS) and the tiered
perf targets (60+ on Linux, 30+ on the M1 Air).

Developer-experience read (from building both spikes hands-on, preliminary):

- GTK4 (gtk4-rs): mature bindings (0.11, stable API), pure Rust, idiomatic (builder pattern
  and closures), UI in Rust with no separate markup language, no C++ shim. The spike was about
  90 lines and mostly worked first try. Nicer to work with so far.
- Qt (cxx-qt): pre-1.0 (0.9.1) with an API that churns across 0.x bumps; the UI lives in QML
  (a separate markup and JS language, a Rust/QML split); a hand-written C++ shim was needed
  just to route Qt's logging off-thread; the bridge macro forbids doc comments on extern
  blocks and has other sharp edges. More powerful cross-platform, but more friction.

This read is preliminary and must be confirmed by actually building each on macOS and Windows.

## Verified findings per toolkit

### Slint (winit) — rejected

- winit 0.30 has no Wayland DnD (winit#1881); inherited by every winit toolkit (Slint,
  Bevy, Iced, egui). See `doc/troubleshooting/winit-toolkits-no-wayland-drag-and-drop.md`.
- An earlier session got inbound Dolphin drops working by hand-rolling a `wl_data_device`
  adapter on winit's Wayland connection, but only after forking Slint to add
  `BackendBuilder::with_clipboard(false)`, because KWin delivers a drag to only a client's
  FIRST data device and Slint's clipboard device took that slot. See
  `doc/troubleshooting/kwin-drag-only-first-data-device.md` and
  `doc/handover/file-manager-native-dnd.md`. Roughly 1345 lines of DnD plumbing plus a
  maintained Slint fork. Ownership too high.

### Qt (cxx-qt) — works, with an accepted on-exit crash

- cxx-qt 0.9.1 against system Qt 6.11.1. Native Wayland QML window verified on KWin
  (`xdg_toplevel`, no XWayland). Package: `packages/desktop-app/file-manager-qt`.
- Fast scroll needs `ListView { reuseItems: true }`: naive create/destroy delegates hit
  11 fps at fast scroll, `reuseItems` + async incubation + cacheBuffer holds 60 fps (after
  a ~3 s warmup). Measured with the standalone `qml` runtime, not yet the integrated
  cxx-qt app. See `doc/troubleshooting/qt-qml-listview-fast-scroll-recycling.md`.
- `reuseItems` segfaults on teardown (use-after-free in
  `QQmlReusableDelegateModelItemsPool::drain`), triggered by any `Loader` wrapping a nested
  reuseItems `ListView`, by three or more nested levels, or even a mixed 2-level layout.
  Qt 6.12 does not fix it (the crash-site change is a pure refactor). Resolution: accept
  the on-exit crash, or `std::process::exit(0)` after `exec()` for a clean exit; no Qt
  fork or backport (ownership). See
  `doc/troubleshooting/qt-qml-reuseitems-teardown-segfault.md`.
- Native DnD is a Qt capability (Dolphin itself is Qt on Wayland), but our Qt spike does
  not yet wire a `DropArea`, so DnD is not verified end to end in our code.
- Non-blocking logging is done: `tracing` on a `tracing-appender` NonBlocking writer, plus
  a `qInstallMessageHandler` C++ shim routing Qt's own logs into the same off-thread sink
  (`src/qt_log.rs`, `src/qt_log.cpp`).
- Cross-platform native feel is first-class, but that is not a deciding factor here (styling
  is out of scope). What counts against Qt on the deciding axis (developer experience): pre-1.0
  cxx-qt API churn, the UI split into QML (a separate markup and JS language), a hand-written
  C++ shim needed just to route logging, and the bridge-macro sharp edges.

### GTK4 (gtk4-rs) — cleanest so far

- gtk4-rs 0.11 (feature `v4_10`) against system GTK 4.22. Package:
  `packages/desktop-app/file-manager-gtk`. About 90 lines.
- Verified end to end on this KWin session:
  - Native Wayland window (`xdg_toplevel`, 114 protocol msgs, no xcb/XWayland).
  - Virtualized `ListView` over a 100000-row model (only ~28 rows realized; screenshot).
  - Clean teardown, `rc=0` (exactly where Qt segfaults).
  - Native inbound DnD: a real Dolphin drop of `~/Downloads/hello.txt` landed via a stock
    `GtkDropTarget` (`GdkFileList` over `wl_data_device`), logged as `inbound file drop`.
  - Non-blocking `tracing`, same as the Qt spike.
  - Fast scroll: the diagonal 2D grid of ~14400 mixed panes (previews and small lists,
    `src/main.rs` under FMGTK_BENCH) holds a steady ~60 fps with thumbnails decoded off the
    render path; naive synchronous per-frame decode drops it to ~4 fps. Clean teardown (rc 0)
    throughout, unlike Qt (no `reuseItems`-style teardown crash).
- Owns nothing: no fork, no hand-rolled protocol, no accepted crash.
- Correction: "Nautilus is GTK4" is not a differentiator over Qt, since Dolphin (a flagship
  Qt file manager) shows Qt is equally proven for this use case. Both are battle-tested; this
  is dropped as a reason.
- Not yet done: outbound drag (`GtkDragSource`); a real off-thread thumbnail decoder (the
  benchmark caches; the app needs a worker plus eviction like `preview.rs`). macOS and Windows
  build-and-run plus perf are now done (see the "macOS (m1) results" and "Windows (x13-win)
  results" sections); native DnD verification on macOS and Windows is still pending.

## macOS (m1) results

Machine: the MacBook Air M1 (full specs in "Test machines"; fanless, weakest in the fleet),
viewed over RustDesk, with all heavy build writes offloaded to the MacData APFS volume.

Build-and-run developer experience:

- GTK4: `brew install gtk4`, then `cargo build`, 43 s first build, zero config, zero env vars,
  zero warnings. Ran the binary directly; native Cocoa window with the virtualized list
  rendered (screenshot). GTK auto-selected the Quartz backend (no Wayland involved on macOS).
- Qt: `brew install qt` (6.11.1), then `cargo build`, 1 m 34 s first build, but required
  `QMAKE=/opt/homebrew/opt/qt/bin/qmake` (macOS names it `qmake`, Linux `qmake6`, so the
  package's hardcoded `QMAKE=/usr/bin/qmake6` does not port), plus one benign linker warning
  (`duplicate -rpath ignored`); build.rs runs qmake/moc and compiles the C++ shim. Ran the
  binary directly (no `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland`, which is Linux-only); native Cocoa window with
  the Rust-backed greeting rendered, proving the Rust/QML bridge round-trips.

Perf (diagonal fast scroll of the ~14400-pane grid with the shared 256-image 384x256 pool,
16 s runs, over RustDesk; the RustDesk screen-capture depresses both toolkits equally, so these
are a lower bound and the head-to-head stays fair):

- GTK4: debug ~30-38 fps; release + `caffeinate` also ~30-38 fps (release did not lift it,
  so the ceiling is the environment, not Rust debug overhead). Steady, always at or above the
  30-fps M1 bar. Clean teardown (`rc 0`) every run.
- Qt (`qml` runtime): oscillated 29-61 fps, briefly touching 60 (so the panel can present at 60
  with RustDesk connected) but dipping to 29 under image load, below the 30-fps bar.

The Qt teardown crash on macOS (decisive): the `qml` strip benchmark, which uses nested
`reuseItems` ListViews, crashed on exit and macOS wrote a CrashReporter `.ips` report
(`EXC_BAD_ACCESS`/`SIGSEGV`, `KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at 0x8`, top frames
`QQmlDelegateModelItem::destroyObjectLater` -> `destroyCacheItem` ->
`QQmlReusableDelegateModelItemsPool::drain` -> `~QQmlDelegateModelPrivate`). Same use-after-free
as on Linux, but on macOS it is a user-visible "quit unexpectedly" dialog, which the user ruled
unacceptable. Detail in `doc/troubleshooting/qt-qml-reuseitems-teardown-segfault.md`.

GTK native DnD on macOS (verified on m1 over RustDesk; the drags reach the app, so this is GTK
handling, not remote input): inbound (Finder -> GTK) is received by the stock `GtkDropTarget`, but
`g_file_get_path` returns None because GDK's macOS backend percent-encodes the URI scheme colon
(`file%3A///...`); the full path is present and recovered by unescaping the URI, so inbound is
workable and it is not a permission/TCC issue. Outbound (GTK -> Finder) is rejected even with a
correctly-encoded `text/uri-list`, so it is done via a native `objc2` AppKit drag shim (a
`MainThreadOnly` `NSDraggingSource` beginning an `NSDraggingSession` with the file `NSURL`), built
and verified: dragging the handle to a Finder folder copies the file. Analogous to the Windows OLE
shim. Reference implementation in `doc/troubleshooting/gtk4-macos-file-dnd.md`.

## Windows (x13-win) results

Machine: the ThinkPad X13 (full specs in "Test machines"), driven over RustDesk. GTK4 builds,
runs, and GPU-renders natively on Windows, and holds a locked 60 fps on the real UX workload.

Build-and-run developer experience:

- The toolchain is a one-time setup: MSYS2 (gvsbuild's helper tools), Python via mise, gvsbuild
  2026.6.0 building GTK 4.22.4 with `--vs-ver vs2026` (gvsbuild defaults to VS 2022 and skips
  VS 2026 otherwise). The GTK source build took ~21 min on this 8-core part; the Rust crate then
  built against it with zero source changes (same `main.rs` and `Cargo.toml` as Linux and
  macOS), 1 m 24 s release.
- The app is shippable as a self-contained folder: exe plus the 44 GTK DLLs plus glib schemas in
  one directory, no external PATH. Verified it loads standalone.

The DirectComposition gotcha (cost hours, worth recording): gvsbuild ships a patch
(`0001-remove-direct-composition.patch`) that turns GTK's DirectComposition from a default-on
feature into an opt-in debug flag, and GTK's GL renderer hard-requires a DirectComposition
device. Without opting in, GL fails to realize ("OpenGL requires Direct Composition") and GTK
falls back to the Cairo software renderer, which rasterizes the whole scene at 3-6 fps. gvsbuild
also builds GTK with Vulkan disabled (`-Dvulkan=disabled`), so there is no Vulkan renderer to
fall back to. The fix is one env var, `GDK_DEBUG=dcomp`, which enables the DirectComposition
device and lets the GL renderer run on the GPU. Full detail and evidence in
`doc/troubleshooting/gtk4-windows-gvsbuild-directcomposition.md`.

Perf (diagonal pan, over RustDesk, `GDK_DEBUG=dcomp`):

- The GPU is not the limit: uncapped (`GDK_DEBUG=dcomp,no-vsync`) the 780M peaked at 68 fps for
  the heaviest scene, and the browser GPU benchmark hit 86. Software fallback was never taken
  with dcomp on (zero `GSK_DEBUG=fallback` lines). Textures were not the limit either: a
  text-only run was slower than the mixed run, since a text pane's Pango layout costs more than
  an image pane's single cached quad.
- The bottleneck under load is CPU per-frame widget work (item realize/bind plus Pango layout),
  and it scales with the number of populated panes animating at once. A single scrolling pane
  holds a locked 60; a dense grid with every cell populated and all columns scrolling at once
  (~72 populated panes in view) collapses to 3-37. That dense case is a synthetic worst case.
- The real UX (a sparse 100x100 board, ~20% of cells populated, ~2000 panes split 50/50 image
  and text, panned diagonally) holds a locked 60-61 fps, p99 frame time ~16.7 ms, after a
  one-second first-paint warmup. This is the number that reflects the product.

Why the sparse board hits 60 while the dense grid does not, and the architecture lesson: the
winning structure places the populated panes at fixed positions on a canvas (empty cells are no
widget), so a pan does not re-run virtualization or relayout; GTK caches each pane's render node
and the pan just re-composites those cached quads on the GPU. That is the `doc/decision/
vector-design.md` tile principle realized inside GTK. For the real UI (see "Open items"): build
the pane board as fixed-position panes on a canvas rather than nested virtualized `ListView`s
(which churn widgets during a pan); decode thumbnails off-thread into a bounded, evicting texture
cache; keep the pan path allocation-free. One scaling boundary: realize-all works because 100x100
(~2000 populated) is bounded; if the board grows an order of magnitude, move to 2D virtualization
or per-pane texture tiles.

Native DnD on Windows (both directions verified): inbound (Explorer -> GTK) works through the
stock `GtkDropTarget` (`GdkFileList`) over GDK's Win32 OLE backend. Outbound (GTK -> Explorer)
does NOT work through GTK: GDK's Win32 drag source leaves the file-to-"Shell IDList Array"
conversion unimplemented, so Explorer rejects the drop. The resolution is a small native Win32
OLE drag source in Rust (the `windows` crate: a shell `IDataObject` via `BHID_DataObject` plus
`SHDoDragDrop`), triggered from a `GtkGestureDrag`; with it, dragging a file to an Explorer folder
copies it (`effect=1`). Windows-only; Wayland and macOS use the native `GtkDragSource`. Detail and
a verified reference implementation in `doc/troubleshooting/gtk4-windows-outbound-file-drag.md`.

Verdict: Windows passes the perf gate (locked 60 for the real workload), which confirms GTK4
across the fleet. This does not re-open the toolkit choice; GTK4 stands, and it remains the only
option satisfying the Wayland DnD constraint (winit-based stacks, including the `vector-design`
engine stack, have no Wayland DnD).

## Branches and worktrees

- `feat/file-manager-qt` at `/var/home/user/worktrees/file-manager-qt`: the Qt spike, the
  three Qt/winit troubleshooting docs, and a require-rustdoc linter change (cxx-qt files
  exempt `use` and trait-impl items). Pushed to `Aquaticat/Monochromatic`.
- `feat/file-manager-gtk` at `/var/home/user/worktrees/file-manager-gtk`: the GTK spike and
  this handover. Pushed.
- `main`: the earlier Slint native-DnD work and the winit-toolkit survey doc.

## Key decisions made

- Leave Slint (its winit base cannot do Wayland DnD without a fork we own).
- Choose GTK4 (gtk4-rs); reject Qt (cxx-qt). See the DECISION bullet in "Status at a glance"
  and the "macOS (m1) results" section for the full evidence.
- Qt was rejected because its required `reuseItems` teardown crash is a user-visible crash
  dialog on macOS, and it missed the 30-fps M1 bar; the earlier "accept the on-exit crash"
  stance held only on Linux and does not survive macOS.
- Log off-thread in both spikes (tracing NonBlocking; Qt logs bridged in).
- Toolchains layered live via `rpm-ostree install --apply-live` (Qt6 devel; gtk4-devel) on
  Linux; `brew install gtk4` / `brew install qt` on macOS.

## Open items and next steps

- DECISION MADE: GTK4. No further toolkit comparison is needed; Windows is now a verification
  step for GTK, not a re-open of the choice.
- Build the real GTK column/pane UI: `GtkColumnView` or nested lists, an off-thread thumbnail
  decoder with eviction (like `preview.rs`, not the benchmark's decode-everything cache), and
  wire outbound `GtkDragSource` plus clipboard. Inbound `GtkDropTarget` is already proven.
- Windows (`x13-win`): build/run, perf, and native DnD (both directions) are done and passed
  (locked 60 on the real sparse-board workload; inbound via stock `GtkDropTarget`; outbound via a
  native Win32 OLE shim, since GTK's own drag source cannot deliver files to Explorer). In the
  real app on Windows: set `GDK_DEBUG=dcomp` in-process for GPU rendering, and port the OLE drag
  shim from `doc/troubleshooting/gtk4-windows-outbound-file-drag.md`.
- macOS DnD is done (see "macOS (m1) results" and `doc/troubleshooting/gtk4-macos-file-dnd.md`):
  inbound works with an in-app URI-unescape (GDK's macOS backend encodes the URI scheme colon);
  outbound is done via a native `objc2` AppKit drag shim (built and verified). Port both into the
  real app, alongside the Windows `GDK_DEBUG=dcomp` + OLE shim; the earlier assumption that macOS
  DnD "just works via Cocoa" was wrong.
- The Qt spike, its troubleshooting docs, and the cxx-qt linter carve-out can stay as recorded
  evidence; no further Qt spike work is planned.

## How to run the spikes

- Qt: `mise run //packages/desktop-app/file-manager-qt:run` (forces `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland`).
- GTK: `mise run //packages/desktop-app/file-manager-gtk:run` (forces `GDK_BACKEND=wayland`).
