# Translation repair handover snapshots: 2026-08-25 to 2026-08-27, part 02

Part 02 of [Translation repair handover snapshots: 2026-08-25 to 2026-08-27](translation-repair-handover-2026-08-25-to-27.md),
whose index lists every part in order.

## Charm Hyper got credit, the full roster is running, and a run's cost is now measured (2026-08-25)

The owner bought 10,000 hypercredits.
`budget-sample` confirmed it live before anything was launched:

```text
METERS synthetic=wet hyper=wet syntheticWeekly=97.09290877272727%
syntheticFiveHour=2750/2750 syntheticThrottled=no hyperBalance=10000
```

Both providers wet at once,
which is the window `#200` had been waiting for since the 14-slice run of 2026-08-24 settled no seat.

### The run in flight

Launched 2026-08-25T01:30Z,
detached,
40 slices,
every seat filled by the whole ten-model roster.

```text
TRANSLATION_REPAIR_RUNS_DIR=~/temp/agent/editor-calibrate-fullroster-20260825 \
  mise run //package/module/translation-repair:editor-calibrate -- 40
```

Log at `~/temp/agent/editor-calibrate-fullroster-20260825.log`,
pid beside it in the `.pid` file.

ALL TEN SEATS ARE ANSWERING,
which is the whole reason this run exists.
The five Hyper-only ones wrote nothing last time.
`gemma-4-26b-a4b-it` in particular HOLDS an editor seat and had never been tested.

DO NOT REBUILD `dist/` WHILE IT RUNS.
The run stamps its cache with the runner's own dependency closure,
so a source change plus any restart invalidates every cached slice and re-buys the whole run.
Documentation is outside that closure and safe to edit.

### What a slice actually costs in wall time, and a revision that should not have happened

Measured over the first six slices:

```text
slice 1  lintong chunk 0        214 s   0 editor  0 refiner
slice 2  windward0032 chunk 14 1362 s   5 editor  0 refiner
slice 3  Huasheng chunk 16       503 s   2 editor  0 refiner
slice 4  Mio chunk 10           1083 s   2 editor  1 refiner
slice 5  lintong chunk 4         967 s   2 editor  1 refiner
slice 6  zheermao101 chunk 2      16 s   0 editor  0 refiner

real slices   4, mean  979 s
cheap slices  2, mean  115 s
real share   67 percent
```

Projected total 7.7 hours,
which is the figure first estimated from roster-round arithmetic.

A REVISION WAS MADE ON ONE SAMPLE AND WAS WRONG.
After slice 2 alone,
at 1362 s,
the projection was moved from 8 hours to 12
and the earlier number was declared superseded.
Slice 2 turned out to be the slowest of the four real slices measured,
which span 503 to 1362 s,
a 2.7-fold spread.
The mean is 979 s and the original estimate was right.

THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT `QNB` FORBIDS:
measure the run-to-run band before crediting a difference smaller than it.
The rule was quoted in the same session it was broken in.
One slice could not distinguish a real slowdown from the top of an ordinary spread,
and no projection should have moved until it could.

### The refiner lane fires, and the two empty slices were not a signal

Slices 1 through 3 each reported `0 refiner rounds (nothing eligible to rewrite)`,
which looked like the refiner standing was going to come back empty for the second run running.

MEASURED INSTEAD OF WAITED.
Across 74 real shipped slices from four archived runs,
mirroring the bounds in `refine-eligibility.ts`:

```text
paragraphs                 156
  markup or non-prose       41
  hard break                 2
  under 120 chars           78
  over 1200 chars            1
  ELIGIBLE                  34

slices carrying at least one eligible paragraph: 32 of 74 (43%)
```

Three empty slices in a row has probability near 19 percent.
Unremarkable.
Slice 4 then produced a refiner round,
which is the first this workstream has ever seen:
the earlier run's binary predated the fix that drives the lane at all.

### What the run costs in credits, and the correction that came with measuring it

The first estimate,
computed from assumed tokens per call,
was 500 to 1,500 credits for a 40-slice run.
THAT WAS HIGH BY ROUGHLY A FACTOR OF FOUR.

Measured from the run's own `reportStreamProgress` lines,
which carry content and reasoning characters per call:

```text
model                     calls   content   thinking  out-tokens  credits
qwen3.8-max                   9         0    125,612      31,403     3.77
minimax-m3                   10     6,409     98,961      26,343     0.69
deepseek-v4-pro-0813         10     4,512          0       1,128     0.10
deepseek-v4-flash-0731       10     4,214      4,066       2,070     0.05
gemma-4-26b-a4b-it           10     3,986          0         997     0.01
```

Scaled to 40 slices the output side is about 120 credits,
and adding an input side priced two to three times lower puts the whole run near 250.
So 10,000 credits buys on the order of 35 runs of this size,
not 6 to 20.

THINKING DOMINATES THE BILL.
`qwen3.8-max` and `hf:zai-org/GLM-5.2` each emitted over 118,000 characters of reasoning
against a few thousand of answer,
and `completion_tokens` counts thinking.
Any cost model built on answer length underreads by most of the bill.

### Nothing we have ever run recorded its token spend (`#210`)

The estimate above had to be computed rather than read,
because token counts are not in any log this project holds.

`formatUsageNote` in `model-content.ts` reads `prompt_tokens` and `completion_tokens`
off the provider's own usage block
and appends them to an `rl.debug` line in both clients.
Every archived run logged at info,
so a grep for `[0-9]+\+[0-9]+ tokens` across every log in `~/temp/agent` returns ZERO matches.

It did not matter while Synthetic was the only provider:
a flat subscription either fits the weekly allowance or it does not,
and the `METERS` line already carries that percentage.
Charm Hyper is metered per token at rates differing by two orders of magnitude across one roster,
so cost depends on which seats answered and by how much.

`spend-line.ts` and `corpus-run/spend-read.ts` close it.
One `SPEND provider=<name> model=<id> prompt=<n> completion=<n>` line per exchange at info,
shaped like the `METERS` line so a reader splits rather than matches,
and a reader that totals a log per provider-and-model seat.

A provider that reports no usage still gets a line carrying `unreported` in both counts.
A run whose provider stayed quiet and a run that spent nothing total the same,
and only the named absence tells them apart.

### Two defects that only writing the consumer could find

Both were in code already reported as verified,
and neither was reachable from the writer's own tests.

THE MARKER CARRIED A LEADING SPACE,
copied from `METERS_MARKER`.
That one only ever meets lines carrying a logger prefix,
so it can demand the space.
This one also meets the bare line the writer RETURNS,
so `readSpendLine(reportSpend(...))` read as prose and answered `not-a-record`.
The marker is now `'SPEND '`
and the reader accepts it at start-of-line or after a space.

THE FIELD TABLE WAS A PLAIN OBJECT,
so a log line writing `__proto__=` would have reached the prototype.
Keys come off a log line;
it is a `Map` now.

This is the same lesson as the `#209` method note from one day earlier,
arriving from the other direction:
there,
mutating a module found arms nothing defended;
here,
writing the consumer found what the producer's tests could not reach.

### `qwen3.8-max` books all of its output as thinking (`#211`)

Measured on the live run:
`qwen3.8-max` reports 0 content characters on every single call,
13 of 13,
against 204,258 reasoning characters.
Other seats do this occasionally,
`hf:zai-org/GLM-5.2` on 3 of 10 and two others on 1 of 10.
Thirteen of thirteen is categorical.

THE VOICE STILL LANDS.
The same model casts ballots with full reasons,
so the answer arrives and is used.
What is wrong is the accounting.

THE OBVIOUS EXPLANATION IS ALREADY REFUTED,
recorded so it is not re-walked.
Charm Hyper speaks the Anthropic protocol,
and forced tool use would deliver an answer as `input_json_delta` fragments.
`anthropic-delta-scan.ts` maps that delta to `content` and its own comment names this exact failure mode:

```text
`input_json_delta` IS THE ANSWER CHANNEL ... Routing them to `reasoning`
would leave every schema'd call looking like a model that thought at length
and answered nothing.
```

So the mapping is right and something else produces the symptom.
Settling it needs a captured frame from a live call,
which waits until the run releases the provider.

Not urgent:
nothing is broken and no quota is wasted.
But a reader of any run log would conclude the most expensive seat on the roster produced nothing,
and the `SPEND` line sidesteps it entirely,
since `completion_tokens` comes from the provider and is channel-agnostic.

### A run's cost is now attributable per seat, and the run in flight will never be (2026-08-25)

`#210` grew its second half while the calibration held the main worktree.
The writer and reader were already built;
what was missing was the thing that turns token counts into money.

#### The price table is an observation with a date on it

`package/module/translation-repair/src/corpus-run/hyper-price.ts` carries all
twenty-six models Charm Hyper lists,
with input,
output,
cache-create and cache-hit rates in credits per million tokens.
The operator read them off the provider's model page on 2026-08-25,
and `HYPER_PRICE_READ_ON` ships beside the rates so every report prints how old its figures are.

The numbers were not transcribed by hand.
A parser read the pasted page with strict structural checks,
refusing any row whose label order or rate format did not match,
and emitted the table.
Transcribing a hundred and four figures by eye is exactly where a silent error would live.

#### The two cache columns are unreachable, which makes the input half exact

Nothing in `package/module/translation-repair/src` sends `cache_control`,
which is one grep to confirm.
On the Anthropic protocol Hyper speaks,
that means there are no cache-creation and no cache-read tokens,
and every prompt token bills at the plain input rate.
So the input half is exact rather than an upper bound.
The rates are carried anyway,
so whoever turns caching on finds them recorded and can see what the saving is worth.

#### Synthetic is never priced, and that is a correctness rule

`priceTally` splits seats into three buckets:
metered and priced,
metered with no row in the table,
and flat-subscription.
Only the first gets a credit figure.
Folding the second into the total at zero would report a cheaper run rather than an incomplete one,
and converting the third would invent a currency that provider does not bill in.
The report names all three separately.

#### What the report says, and the two controls it was checked with

```sh
mise run //package/module/translation-repair:spend-report -- <log> [<log> ...]
```

Positive control,
on a throwaway fixture carrying every case at once:
priced seats sorted by cost with their share of the bill,
one unpriced metered seat named rather than zeroed,
one subscription seat carried with tokens and no credits,
one call that reported no usage counted as a floor,
one prose line mentioning the marker correctly not counted,
and one truncated record counted as unreadable.
The arithmetic checks by hand:
`qwen3.8-max` at 84000 prompt and 51065 completion tokens comes to 3.36 plus 6.13,
or 9.49 credits.

Negative control,
on the live calibration log:
`NOTHING RECORDED`,
which is the honest answer and not a zero total.

#### The run in flight will never have a cost breakdown

The calibration started before `spend-line.ts` existed,
and the running build is the one it started with.
Its log carries no `SPEND` line and never will.
Rebuilding `dist/` mid-run would invalidate every cached slice and re-buy the whole run,
so this is not a thing to fix.
It is the last run this project will make that cannot say what it cost.

What the meter does give is the total.
The balance opened at exactly 10000 and read 9909 after nine slices:
about ten credits per slice,
so a forty-slice run lands near four hundred credits and a ten-thousand balance buys roughly
twenty-five of them.
That corrects the earlier per-slice figure of 8.33,
which came from a smaller sample.
The total is all the meter can say.
Which seat spent it is what the `SPEND` lines add.

#### Proven by removal

Three mutations,
each caught by the file that owns the guard and by no other:

- Dropping the `glm-5.2` row from the price table:
   caught by the catalog-join case,
  which asserts every model `hyper-catalog.ts` can seat has a row.
- Making `priceTally` inherit the tally's token order instead of sorting by cost:
   caught by an ordering case built so the two disagree,
  where the seat with ten times the tokens is a quarter of the bill.
- Looking rates up on the object literal instead of the `Map`:
   caught by the `__proto__` case.

Full suite after:
659 suites,
zero failures,
zero lint warnings.

#### Still parked, not landed

Everything lives in `~/temp/agent/spend-telemetry-210.tar.gz`,
fourteen files with repo-relative paths,
untarred over the repo root to apply.
It cannot be committed from the isolated worktree,
which lacks the forbidden-strings scanner and is refused by the `branch-worktree-only` policy.
It must land after the calibration finishes,
and after any second calibration batch,
because pooling needs no drift opt-in only while the build is unchanged.

### `#211` diagnosed from logs and source, without spending a call (2026-08-25)

The earlier note recorded this as needing a captured frame from a live call,
and put the count at 13.
Both were wrong.
The count is about seventy calls,
and most of the diagnosis was reachable by reading.

#### The premise, remeasured

Across the calibration's first nine slices,
`qwen3.8-max` opened seventy-one streams and reported zero content characters on seventy of them,
while casting seventy-one ballots with full prose reasons.

#### There are two independent parsers, and only one of them is blind

`anthropic-completion.ts` imports `json-guard.ts` and `completion-shape.ts` and nothing else.
It never touches `anthropic-delta-scan.ts`.
So the thing that extracts the answer and the thing that counts characters for the progress line
read the same bytes through different code.
The vote landing while the count reads zero is the two disagreeing,
not the model failing.

#### The mechanism, from `channelFor` in `anthropic-delta-scan.ts`

Block type outranks delta type:

```ts
if (blockType === THINKING_BLOCK)
  return 'reasoning';
return DELTA_CHANNELS[deltaType] ?? UNREAD;
```

Its own comment says why that precedence exists:
providers have been seen sending plain text deltas inside a thinking block,
and reading only the delta type would file that as the answer.
The rule is right for the model it was written for.
If `qwen3.8-max` declares a thinking block and sends its answer deltas inside it,
the same rule files its entire reply as reasoning,
while the extractor,
which reads only `delta.type` and ignores blocks,
still recovers the answer.

`qwen3.8-max` is also the only model on the roster configured `toolChoice: 'auto'`;
every other Hyper seat is `forced`.
`hyper-catalog.ts` records that it answers HTTP 400 to every forced-tool variant tried.

#### What separates this from the ordinary case

For every other model,
the zero-content count equals the cut count exactly:
`hf:zai-org/GLM-5.2` five and five,
`hf:Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B` two and two.
Those are streams that ended before any content arrived,
which is expected.

`qwen3.8-max` reports seventy zero-content streams against twelve cuts.
Fifty-eight of them completed cleanly and still counted nothing.
Cutting cannot explain that,
and no other model shows the pattern.

`deepseek-v4-pro-0813` shows a smaller separate anomaly,
eight zero-content streams with no cuts at all,
recorded here so it is not folded into this one.

#### This is not cosmetic: the runaway guard is blind to this model

`stream-runaway-watch.ts` applies `CONTENT_OVERRUN_CAP` to the content channel only,
and its comment states the reasoning channel is deliberately untouched.
If this model's output is filed as reasoning,
the volume bound never sees it,
so nothing stops it early and it runs to the straggler deadline instead.

The cut rates match that prediction.
`qwen3.8-max` is cut on twelve of seventy-one streams,
near seventeen percent,
the highest on the roster by a factor of two and a half.
`hf:zai-org/GLM-5.2` is next at five of seventy-two.
Six of the eleven seats are cut zero times.
Each cut is a lost voice on a panel that was paid for.

#### What is still owed

One thing,
and it is now a single cheap check rather than an investigation:
capture one `qwen3.8-max` stream and confirm it declares a thinking block
whose deltas carry the answer.
If it does,
the fix is at `channelFor`,
not at the model,
and the candidate shape is to keep the block-type override only for delta types
that are not themselves answer channels.
Do not change it before the frame is seen:
the override exists because a real provider needed it,
and removing it blind would restore the defect it was added for.

### Authorization to drop weak models, and why the worst-looking seat is not one (2026-08-25)

The owner granted authorization to drop models that are exceptionally bad.
Recorded here with the guard that has to travel with it.

#### The instrument now names drop candidates, and warns about one confound

`~/temp/agent/standing-stats.mjs` previously reported a seat as `SETTLED` on the
absolute value of its z score,
which puts a seat far above the pooled null and
one far below it under the same word.
It now splits by direction:
`CARRIES ITS SEAT` above,
`DROP CANDIDATE` below,
each still requiring both the per-round and the per-slice reading to clear the
Bonferroni threshold for the actual number of comparisons.

It also prints a standing warning to check a seat's cut rate before dropping it.
A seat whose voice is lost scores low for a reason that is not its judgement.

#### Its control is now a real log rather than pasted figures

The analyser learned the second header shape that `producer-calibrate` prints,
so the prior forty-round producer run reads directly.
That run is now the positive control:
pooled null 13.48% over 336 of 2492 ballots,
ten comparisons,
Bonferroni threshold 2.807.

#### The evidence says drop nothing today, and says it twice

`hf:nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-NVFP4` sits at 3.0%,
z of -4.99,
which clears the threshold by a wide margin in the negative direction.
Its cut rate in the run now in flight is zero of seventy-eight,
so the score is not voice loss.
That is genuine weakness,
and it is already acted on:
the writer seats were settled at three from this same run,
and a model at 3.0% was never among them.
Nothing to drop.

`qwen3.8-max` is the opposite case and the important one.
It is the BEST producer on the roster at 27.0%,
z of +5.22,
and it carries the worst cut rate on the roster,
twelve of seventy-eight.
It earns the top score while losing twelve voices to the defect in `#211`.

So the seat that looks worst by cut rate is the strongest seat by judgement,
and dropping on the cut rate alone would have removed it.
That is exactly the confound the warning exists for.

#### What this changes about `#211`

It stops being an accounting curiosity.
The scanner mis-files this model's output,
the volume bound therefore cannot see it,
it runs to the straggler deadline,
and the pipeline loses a sixth of the voices
of its highest-scoring producer.
Fixing it does not tidy a log line,
it recovers the best seat's lost ballots.

#### What the authorization is waiting on

The editor standing,
which the run in flight is measuring and which is not the
producer standing.
`#136` already recorded a model that is worst at one stage and better than two
peers at another,
so a producer table cannot seat or unseat an editor.
When the run lands,
the analyser names candidates and the cut rates say which of
them are real.

## No volume guard can see `qwen3.8-max`, and stragglers may cost more than serialization (2026-08-25)

Measured on the live full-roster calibration at 15 of 40 slices,
from the run log alone.
Full working in `doc/audit/every-volume-guard-is-blind-to-one-model.md`,
committed as `d16a616e3`.
This run predates the parked `#211` fix,
so every number here is a clean pre-fix baseline.

### The measurement

Every seat was asked exactly 120 times,
so the denominators need no adjustment.
Seven of the ten lose no voice at all.
The 34 losses are `qwen3.8-max` 21,
`hf:zai-org/GLM-5.2` 11,
`hf:Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B` 2.

`qwen3.8-max` reports content characters of 0 at the median AND at the 95th percentile,
across all 100 of its completed streams.
Not one byte it sent reached the content channel.
Every other seat medians between 303 and 619.
That is `#211` confirmed at production scale,
where it had been proved on one captured frame run.

### Why that is worse than a telemetry error

`src/stream-runaway-watch.ts` applies its volume cap to the content channel only,
and its module note says the reasoning channel is untouched.
`#156` set that bound at 32000 and declined a reasoning bound deliberately.
So for this one seat the chain closes:
answer filed as reasoning,
cap reads content,
content is always zero,
no volume guard can ever fire.
The only thing that stops it is `STRAGGLER_GRACE_MS`,
and that is what its 21 cuts are.

### The correction to `#211`'s recorded prediction

`#211` predicted the cut rate would fall toward the roster's.
That is not supported and has been replaced on the task.
The cuts are volume runaways,
not stalls:
`qwen3.8-max` is cut mid-reply after 106,405 characters
once and then 19 of 21 times between 293,163 and 350,293,
a tight cluster because the cut is time-bound while the stream rate is steady.
Post-fix those bytes meet `contentCap`,
so the call is cut at roughly 32000 rather than 300,000,
in seconds rather than 180.
What changes is when and how expensively the voice is lost,
not obviously whether.
Two mechanisms pull opposite ways:
an early overrun rides the retry predicate `#156` built,
giving the model an attempt it never used to get,
against which a model emitting 300,000 characters may simply overrun again.
Record the outcome,
not the prediction.

### What it redirects

The straggler cuts group into 29 distinct events.
At 180 seconds each that is an upper bound of 1.45 hours inside a 3.73 hour run.
It is an upper bound and must be read as one:
`runStageRound` assembles from its `arrived` map rather than awaiting abandoned calls,
so the true per-event cost is at most the grace window and may be less.

That is potentially a larger lever than the serialization question `#213` was opened on,
and 21 of the 34 cuts are the seat `#211` already fixes.
So the order is now:
land `#211` and re-measure,
then re-derive the window,
then prototype fan-out.
Measuring fan-out first would be measuring a system about to change underneath it.

### Two tasks this opened

`#214` re-derives the straggler window.
`doc/decision/translation-repair-straggler-grace.md` rests on the claim that no hung call had ever
been recorded and every cut voice was slow-but-working.
A voice cut mid-reply after 3,020,068 characters refutes that.
The decision should be superseded rather than edited,
since its reasoning was correct for the
population it had,
and it should not be reverted:
60 seconds really did cut `hf:zai-org/GLM-5.2` inside its ordinary range,
and still would.

`#215` adds elapsed milliseconds to the stream completion line.
A production run currently cannot answer where its own wall-clock went,
because dispatch is logged at `debug` and production emits only `info` and `warn`,
while the completion line carries `firstByte` and `maxGap` but no duration.
That is why the 1.45 hour figure is a bound rather than a measurement,
and why `#213` cannot yet measure the baseline it needs.

### Corrected count for `#213`

The first pass said seven serialization sites and grepped four wrong paths.
The full sweep finds eleven resting on the refuted premise,
seven of them on the production path,
and `src/editor-ensemble.ts:248` is the one with a clean argument:
envelopes within a slice are independent,
nothing reads back an earlier envelope's outcome,
and `Promise.all` preserves order,
so gathering concurrently and folding in index order is
byte-identical output for pure latency.
The task carries the full list,
including the sites that are correctly sequential and must not be
touched.

### Two more findings from the same run (2026-08-25)

The deepseek zero-content anomaly is RESOLVED,
and it is the same defect as `#211` intermittently.
It had been held open because the instrument used then was a 40-line scan window over 9 samples
with a measured 39 percent hit rate on healthy calls.
The completion line's own content count answers it on roughly 1,200 streams:
`deepseek-v4-pro-0813` is zero-content on 12 of 127,
every one with reasoning above zero,
against a baseline of exactly zero across eight other seats.
What remains a prediction rather than a conclusion is whether `#211`'s fix removes those 12,
since the fix exempts `input_json_delta` and not `text_delta`.
Count them on the first post-fix run.

`#216` implements an owner instruction that turns out never to have been implemented:
"Please make sure to put even the full tool schema into system prompts."
Seventeen modules build a system message and NOT ONE carries its response schema;
the seven that name a schema at all name it only as the API-level `responseFormat`.
The supporting evidence is that all 6 schema failures in this run are on Charm Hyper seats,
`gemma-4-26b-a4b-it` 4 and `qwen3.8-max` 2,
with zero on Synthetic,
and one of them reads `{"checks": "\n[{\"region\":` ,
a JSON-stringified array where the schema declares an array of objects.
That is the wrong-tool-call-format failure the owner named.
The provider split is confounded,
since those seats are also different models,
so the task says so and does not claim the protocol causes it.

### The `#200` power projection flips, on measured accrual (2026-08-25)

`#200` recorded that 40 slices "lands a hair under the line",
worst-case z 2.776 against a
Bonferroni threshold of 2.807 at ten seats.
That rested on a projected 63 percent yield.
Measured at 16 of 40 slices,
the yield is 75 percent:
12 of 16 slices contributed a judged round.

Judged-round accrual,
counted from `selectBestCandidate` votes rather than projected:

-   407 votes over 16 slices,
    which at roughly one ballot per judge is about 41 rounds.
-   2.54 rounds per slice,
    and 2.30 with the single richest slice dropped,
    so no one slice carries the rate.
-   The 14-slice run that settled nothing managed 2.07 per slice from 10 contributing slices.

Holding the prior effect size,
40 slices reaches about 30 contributing slices,
so z scales by the square root of 3 and the deflated best z goes from 1.76 to roughly 3.05,
clearing 2.807 by 0.24.

DO NOT ACT ON THIS EITHER,
for the same reason the original projection carried.
The effect size it holds was measured on FIVE models,
and the pooled preference rate roughly halves
at ten seats,
so the z it implies could move in either direction.
The margin is thin in both directions and the run measures the effect size directly.
Read the standing when it exits;
the projection is superseded either way.
