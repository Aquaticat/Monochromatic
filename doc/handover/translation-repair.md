# Translation repair session handover

## Current handover, 2026-09-06

The current session snapshot is
[`translation-repair-handover-2026-09-06.md`](translation-repair-handover-2026-09-06.md).
Read it first:
it carries the repository tip,
the pass in flight,
the fifth defect class,
the two defaults that moved,
the operating rule,
and the next passes in order.
The 2026-09-04 snapshot,
[`translation-repair-handover-2026-09-04.md`](translation-repair-handover-2026-09-04.md),
still carries the four earlier classes,
the three pages that shipped,
and the seven steps by which a page is read.

The work in progress is the LEGACY slice pipeline under the owner's direction decision of 2026-09-01
and the OpenRouter order of 2026-09-03,
not the finite redesign.
Corpus runs,
model calls,
and implementation on that pipeline ARE authorized;
the redesign-scope prohibitions in the 2026-09-01 section below remain in force,
and the readiness judgement lives in
[`translation-repair-readiness-signal.md`](../planning/translation-repair-readiness-signal.md).
The pipeline is not production ready.

ALWAYS KILL AND RELAUNCH is the owner's rule of 2026-09-06 for every pass:
when source changes while a pass is running,
kill the pass by pid,
build,
and relaunch the same entry into a fresh runs dir on the new build.
Never let a pass finish on a build a commit has superseded,
and never read its page as readiness evidence.
When the fix is known before the launch,
land it first and launch once.
The rule is written in the package README ("A source change while a pass is in flight means kill and relaunch")
and in the runbook's launch and restore steps;
it is deliberately not a root `AGENTS.md` rule.

## Superseded handover, 2026-09-01

### Start here

The finite redesign stopped after Candidate M failed its single pinned-Carena calibration.
Read
[`translation-repair-redesign-failure-2026-09-01.md`](../audit/translation-repair-redesign-failure-2026-09-01.md)
before changing code or spending another model call.
It reconstructs Candidates A through M,
separates evidence from hypotheses,
and records the implementation stop.

No Candidate A through M is production-eligible.
No Candidate M code entered production.
Do not implement Candidate N,
retry or continue a spent prompt,
change a spent prompt's route or ceiling,
repair a private response,
or add another producer,
reviewer,
resolver,
continuation,
or fallback stage.
On 2026-09-01 the owner delegated the direction decision,
and it is recorded in
[`translation-repair-post-redesign-direction.md`](../decision/translation-repair-post-redesign-direction.md):
the redesign stays closed,
but bounding the production consolidation machinery and a four-entry verification pass are authorized.
The redesign-scope prohibitions in this section remain in force.

### Repository state

- Worktree:
  `/var/home/user/worktrees/translation-repair`.
- Branch:
  `translation-repair-rebased`.
- Timestamped failure-report baseline commit:
  `2c5f1159d21563f519a5f7ea19f8d473a36bd419`.
- Candidate M preflight documentation commit:
  `8226daa11`.
- Timestamped failure-report commit:
  `2c5f1159d`.
- Unrelated dirty path:
  `.idea/.name`.
  Keep it excluded.
- The process registry returned zero running background processes.
  The exact `/proc` argument audit in
  [`translation-repair-process-state-2026-09-01.json`](../audit/translation-repair-process-state-2026-09-01.json)
  found no `corpus-pass.mjs`,
  `corpus-pass.ts`,
  `resume-run.sh`,
  or `resume-supervisor.ts` process.
  These are the pass and supervisor names recorded by the legacy continuity documentation;
  the evidence does not make a claim about arbitrary unrelated command names.
- Production still uses the pre-redesign slice pipeline.
- Production replacement by a finite whole-document architecture remains closed.
  The completion objective was redefined by the owner on 2026-09-01:
  it quantifies over one small,
  one medium,
  one large entry plus Carena,
  per the direction decision.

The finite-prototype branch is
`prototype/translation-repair-finite-pipelines`.
Its local and GitHub commit is
`d9305094fa9d02e4776c603c412b89ed14e1a890`.
Candidate M's foundation,
lifecycle,
GFP isolation,
and sanitized mutation summary are durable there.
Do not merge that branch into production.

### Candidate M terminal disposition

The exact public harness SHA-256 was
`6f0004e010d1477c3e2eea84287d03d21724495d6c2595d8fceef9131b3bb952`.
Its revision-specific GitHub artifact is
`https://gist.github.com/Aquaticat/6ff4fd2f600fc257064aa32eee4c9753/b6c9fb5ebf943a5cd8cfeebbb4c6a2fbbc1e6654`.
The run pinned prototype commit
`d9305094fa9d02e4776c603c412b89ed14e1a890`,
manifest digest
`96368249c30d54192120b9d45aaf6cc742e4b725442158d93172fed163d23aef`,
and corpus commit
`a80634a674f94861ea3b7056fba054ca9eab1a2c`.

All 14 static nodes terminated:

- eight provider exchanges;
- four completed nodes;
- four spent-unusable nodes;
- six deterministic skips.

Qwen produced the sole admitted candidate.
MiniMax's author stopped at 32,000 output tokens.
Qwen's publication-language challenge failed exact anchor admission.
Both GLM challenges stopped at 32,000 output tokens.
MiniMax returned clean nonself challenges in both roles,
but one family per role did not satisfy the two-family floor.
Qwen's clean fidelity challenge was self-clean and correctly did not qualify.

Selection recorded `evidenceFloorMet: false`,
`productionEligible: false`,
no admitted dissent,
and Qwen and GLM as abstaining verifier identities.
Independent restart replay made zero transport calls,
reproduced the result,
and left the pre-post-audit runtime tree byte-identical.
Complete source,
archive,
candidate,
and image reading independently rejected the page for fidelity,
structure,
actor-attribution,
and publication-language defect classes.

Output-root directories and files are mode `0700` and `0600`,
respectively.
The external summary and audit scripts are mode `0600`.

Keep credentials,
image bytes,
and raw requests and responses private.
Documentation wording redaction is deferred while the package remains unfinished and not production-ready.
The
[package-local redaction policy](../../package/module/translation-repair/doc/redaction-timing.md)
makes redaction a required readiness gate before a finished or production-ready declaration.

### Spent-prompt boundary

Candidates A through M are terminal under their tested contracts.
In particular:

- Candidate I's author and verifier prompts are spent;
- Candidate K's author prompts are spent;
- Candidate K's verifier prompts were not dispatched,
  but Candidate K is rejected and they are not authorized work;
- Candidate L's author prompts and three dispatched candidate-one verifier prompts are spent;
- Candidate L's candidate-zero verifier templates were skipped and are not authorized later dispatch;
- Candidate M's author prompts and six dispatched candidate-zero challenger prompts are spent;
- Candidate M's candidate-one challenger templates were skipped and are not authorized later dispatch.

Truncated,
malformed,
caller-guard-rejected,
deadline-aborted,
and indeterminate outputs remain spent evidence.
Do not reconstruct partial JSON or hidden reasoning.

### What remains authorized

The paragraph below was written on 2026-09-01 and states the redesign scope's standing prohibitions,
which hold.
Its account of legacy work is superseded by the 2026-09-04 snapshot:
the OpenRouter fallback landed on 2026-09-03,
and three entries have since been run and read.

Inside the redesign scope,
only documentation and evidence-preservation work remains authorized:
keep the timestamped report and this handover synchronized,
and preserve durable links,
digests,
commits,
and stop conditions.

Outside the redesign scope,
the owner's 2026-09-01 direction decision authorizes legacy-pipeline work:
bound the consolidation correction machinery so a normal run always terminates with a published page,
then run one fresh pass over the four-entry completion set and read its actual output.
