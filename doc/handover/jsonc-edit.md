# Handover: splitting JSONC out of module-es into module-jsonc-edit

Living status doc.
Updated as the package is scaffolded and implemented.

## Goal

Extract the hand-written comment-preserving JSONC parser from
`package-paused/module/es` into a new active package `package/module/jsonc-edit`
(`private: true`), and build a full read, edit, and write API on top, shaped after
`package/module/toml-edit`.
Performance is an explicit goal (the native `JSON.parse` fast-path).

## Where this work lives

- Worktree:
  `/var/home/user/worktrees/jsonc-edit` on branch `feat/jsonc-edit`.
- The whole feature lives on that branch;
  merge to `main` when ready.

## Decisions (locked)

See `doc/decision/jsonc-edit-parser-foundation.md` for the full rationale.
Summary:

- Keep the hand-written parser (clean rewrite), do not adopt a library.
  Every surveyed library fails a reason-for-existence:
  merged per-key and per-value comment model, `JSON.parse` fast-path, zero-dep,
  run-everywhere (no WebAssembly), branded types.
- Write model:
  canonical rebuild from the structured tree, comments as first-class data.
  No source ranges, no splice mode.
  Raw scalar tokens preserved for unedited values;
  duplicate keys preserved losslessly.
- API:
  immutable `JsoncEditState`, named free-functions with a `jsonc` prefix.
  The `$` / namespace export style is dropped.
- Comment API:
  attached model (`jsoncGetComment` / `jsoncSetComment` for a value's comment,
  `jsoncGetKeyComment` / `jsoncSetKeyComment` for a key's comment).
- Tests:
  full `toml-edit` parity (unit, fast-check fuzz, STB adversarial boundaries, real-world
  corpus, V8 coverage-baseline gate, a curated JSONC conformance harness).
- es cleanup:
  delete the `t object/t jsonc` subtree plus the t-string and t-boolean jsonc type bits
  from `module-es`, and drop the jsonc namespaces from its barrels.

## Public API (target)

- `parseJsoncEdit`, `jsoncStringify`
- `jsoncGet`, `jsoncGetValue`, `jsoncHas`, `jsoncKeys`, `jsoncSet`, `jsoncDelete`
- `jsoncGetComment`, `jsoncSetComment`, `jsoncGetKeyComment`, `jsoncSetKeyComment`

## How to run (in the worktree)

```bash
# from /var/home/user/worktrees/jsonc-edit
mise i                                                    # install pinned toolchain (done once)
mise run //package/module/jsonc-edit:build
mise run //package/module/jsonc-edit:lint:oxlint
mise run //package/module/jsonc-edit:lint:types
mise run //package/module/jsonc-edit:test:unit          # co-located unit tests
mise run //package/module/jsonc-edit:test:mutation -- --full-suite

# Non-runtime tooling lives in per-concern sidecar packages:
mise run //package/module/jsonc-edit.fuzz:test:unit      # property tests (default budget)
mise run //package/module/jsonc-edit.fuzz:fuzz           # longer fast-check campaign
mise run //package/module/jsonc-edit.fuzz:fuzz:coverage  # V8 reachability gate
mise run //package/module/jsonc-edit.bench:bench         # parse benchmark
mise run //package/module/jsonc-edit.conformance:test:conformance
```

## Status

Complete and merged to `main`. The runtime package builds, type-checks, and lints clean
(zero errors, zero warnings); its co-located unit tests pass; the fuzz, bench, and
conformance sidecars pass; the coverage gate reports all 17 runtime source files reachable.
Both original follow-ups are done (logger OPFS fix picked up via merge; the troubleshooting
docs repointed to `package/module/jsonc-edit`).

The non-runtime tooling now lives in per-concern sidecar packages so the runtime package's
`src/` is pure production code, which scopes a whole-package mutation run to real runtime
files:

- `module-jsonc-edit.fuzz`: fast-check property tests, run budget, V8 coverage-reachability gate.
- `module-jsonc-edit.bench`: parse benchmark.
- `module-jsonc-edit.conformance`: curated JSONC conformance corpus.

Mutation testing is wired via `//package/module/jsonc-edit:test:mutation` (container-isolated
Stryker, mirroring file-enforcer). `--full-suite` is required because the unit tests are
organized by API surface (`parse`, `stringify`, `edit`, `comment`), not per source file, so the
harness's filename-stem test selection would otherwise pick no tests for files like `scan.ts`.

Progress (newest first):

- 2026-06-30 (mutation hardening to the equivalent-mutant floor):
  Drove the whole-package score from 68.69% to 95.76% (474 killed / 12 survived / 9 timeout
  / 588 compile-error) by adding branch-level unit tests for every reachable path: direct
  tests for the internal `scan`, `parse-trivia`, `parse-close`, emit, and `parse-scalar`
  helpers, error-name assertions, and deeper `edit`, `comment`, `parse`, and `stringify`
  coverage (array-element set versus append, out-of-range and missing-segment errors,
  duplicate-key last-wins, numeric-segment-into-record and string-segment-into-array kind
  errors, dangling-comment folding, depth-guard limits, exact canonical layout, lone
  slash/star inputs that are not comments). Every remaining survivor was verified to be a
  genuine equivalent mutant or an infinite-loop mutant the harness detects by timeout.
  Counting the 9 timeouts as detected (Stryker's default) and excluding the 12 equivalents,
  every non-equivalent mutant is killed.

  A diagnostic detour is written up in `doc/troubleshooting/stryker-survivor-triage.md`:
  Stryker emits one `ConditionalExpression` mutant per `&&`/`||` operand plus the whole
  test, told apart only by column, so a survivor read by line alone and reproduced as the
  whole-condition variant looked like a harness bug but was a per-operand equivalent. The
  harness itself was verified correct.

  Equivalent mutants (Survived, no test can distinguish them):
  - `edit-navigate.ts:57` `(typeof segment === 'string') -> true`: a record reached with a
    numeric segment gives `findLast` no match, so the result is `NODE_ABSENT` either way
    (record keys are strings, and `string === number` is always false).
  - `parse-close.ts:33` and `:120` `(dangling.length === 0) -> false`: folding an empty
    dangling list is a no-op, since `appendComments` returns the node unchanged for it.
  - `parse-jsonc.ts:16` and `:50` (logger tag and trace strings to `""`): log-only, no parse
    output depends on them.
  - `parse-jsonc.ts:76` `(parsed === FASTPATH_MISS) -> false`: `FASTPATH_MISS` is a symbol
    already excluded by the following `typeof parsed !== 'object'` arm.
  - `parse-trivia.ts:47` and `:160`, `scan.ts:70` and `:181`
    `cursor < source.length -> cursor <= source.length`: the loop returns on an `undefined`
    character, so the extra boundary iteration produces the same result.
  - `parse-trivia.ts:165` `char === '\n' -> false` and `'\n' -> ""`: the newline branch
    returns the same `{ comments, commaSeen, end }` the generic fall-through already returns.

  Timeout-detected mutants (infinite loops; Stryker's default scores these as killed):
  - `parse.ts:127` and `:230`, `parse-trivia.ts:47` and `:160` (loop body to `{}`): removing
    the cursor advance makes the scan loop never terminate.
  - `scan.ts:78` `cursor += 1 -> cursor -= 1`: the string-escape skip runs backward.
  - `scan.ts:351` (line-comment newline literal to `""`): `indexOf('')` returns the start
    offset, so the comment scanner never advances.
  - `scan.ts:401` cluster: breaking the unterminated-block-comment close check makes
    `scanBlockComment` return a non-advancing end, so the caller loops forever.
- 2026-06-30 (sidecars + mutation testing):
  Extracted the non-runtime tooling into three per-concern sidecar packages
  (`jsonc-edit.fuzz`, `jsonc-edit.bench`, `jsonc-edit.conformance`) so the runtime
  package src is pure production code; wired container-isolated Stryker mutation testing
  (`test:mutation`, `--full-suite`). Fixed a pre-existing bootstrap failure in the shared
  mutation runtime image: the baked `npm.package_manager = "pnpm"` made a fresh container
  try to install pnpm with pnpm; the Containerfile now forces `MISE_NPM_PACKAGE_MANAGER=npm`
  for that install step. Runtime package and all three sidecars verified green.
  Taught the mutation harness (`selectTestsForSource`) to also include sibling sidecar
  `*.unit.test.ts` files as mutant killers; they resolve to the mutated `/work` source through
  the workspace `/ts` relative symlink, so the fuzz and conformance suites participate. That
  lifted the whole-package score from 59.60% (295 killed / 191 survived, unit tests only)
  to 68.69% (340 killed / 146 survived / 9 timeout / 588 compile-error). Remaining survivors
  cluster in the edit and comment write API (`edit-set` 63%, `edit-comment` 52%) and the
  close/trivia parse paths (`parse-close` 7%), which the property and conformance suites do not
  exercise; hardening those unit tests is the natural follow-up.
- 2026-06-30 (complete):
  Lint-remediated the parser to the functional rules, then built the canonical
  serializer, the immutable edit API, the comment-as-data API, the unit/property/
  conformance test suites, the coverage-baseline gate, and the parse benchmark; removed
  the JSONC code from the paused `module-es`. All verified end to end against the built
  bundle.
- 2026-06-30 (later):
  Package scaffolded and building. Value model (`comment.ts`, `brand.ts`,
  `value.ts`) done, type-checks and lints clean. Parser core written:
  `errors.ts`, `merge-comments.ts`, `scan.ts`, `parse-trivia.ts`, `parse.ts`,
  `parse-jsonc.ts`. The parser type-checks but does NOT yet pass oxlint:
  it is written in an imperative cursor style that violates the repo's
  functional rules. Committed as WIP. Lint remediation is the next step,
  before the serializer.
- 2026-06-30:
  worktree created, toolchain installed, decision doc written, task list set up.

## Lint remediation plan for the parser core

The parser logic is correct and type-checks; only its style needs reshaping to
satisfy these rules (learned from the rule sources and fixtures):

- `no-restricted-syntax/no-function-root-let`:
  a root-level `let` is allowed only in the "helper shape" where the function
  ends with `return <thatIdentifier>`. Otherwise move the cursor into a
  `for (let cursor = start; cursor < source.length; )` init (empty increment,
  advance inside), which is not a function-root `let`. Accumulators (`comment`,
  `commaSeen`) should become a `const` array pushed to in the loop, then reduced
  or derived at the single return.
- `no-restricted-syntax/no-nullish-union` (shortcode `l`):
  no `T | undefined` or `T | null` annotations. Use `?:` optionals, plain `T`,
  or a `Symbol` sentinel. So `TriviaScan`, `TrailingScan`, `ScalarScan`, and the
  helper params that read `comment?: JsoncComment | undefined` drop the
  `| undefined`; locals typed `X | undefined` get restructured away (collect into
  a `const` array, conditionally include the property at return so no `undefined`
  is ever assigned to an optional).
- `eslint(init-declarations)`:
  every binding initialized at declaration.
- `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`:
  never assign `undefined` to an optional property; build the return object with
  the property present only when defined (`length === 0 ? { end } : { comment, end }`).

Concretely, restructure `scan.ts` (`scanString`, `scanNumber`),
`parse-trivia.ts` (`skipTrivia`, `captureTrailing`), and the loops in `parse.ts`
to the for-init-cursor plus const-accumulator shape. Also one file trips
`max-lines` (300 code lines): split `parse.ts` (move `closeArray`/`closeRecord`
and the entry helpers to a sibling, keep the mutually-recursive
`parseValue`/`parseArray`/`parseRecord`/`parseEntry` together).

## Source of truth for behavior

The original parser and its tests under
`package-paused/module/es/src/types/t object/t jsonc/` are the behavioral spec.
The rewrite preserves their invariants;
it does not preserve their structure or style.

## Open implementation notes

- The value model needs raw scalar text on nodes so canonical emit can preserve
  author formatting (`1.0` stays `1.0`) for unedited values.
- `fastPath.ts` and a few siblings exceed the 300-line `max-lines` budget;
  split on the way in, do not carry the violation over.
- Benchmarks compare against `jsonc-eslint-parser` and `jsonc-parser`
  (devDependencies of this package).
