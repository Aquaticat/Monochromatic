# Keeping the corpus pass running across agent sessions

A corpus pass outlives the session that started it,
and the API failures that
 end an agent session mid-work do not end the pass.
This records what is
 supervising the `pass13` run,
why there are two supervisors rather than one,
 and how to stop them.

Nothing here lives in the repository.
The scripts,
logs and the runs directory
 are all outside git,
because the runs directory holds corpus text from an
 unlicensed source.

## Current status, 2026-09-01

No corpus pass or continuity supervisor is running for the current redesign work.
This is historical operating evidence for the legacy pipeline,
not authorization to relaunch a run.
The finite replacement effort stopped after Candidate M failed.

and the current section of [`translation-repair.md`](translation-repair.md) first.

Do not recreate supervisors,
resume a historical root,
or launch a fresh pass until the owner explicitly authorizes a new phase.
If that happens,
revalidate every command and commit identity against current source.

These files are historical evidence,
not authorization to relaunch a pass.
