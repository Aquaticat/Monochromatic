# Building the real GTK4 file manager (Niri column-strip UI) — handover

Live cross-session state for the implementation of the real file manager on GTK4, following the
approved plan. Kept updated as the build proceeds. The toolkit exploration that chose GTK4 is a
separate, finished doc (`file-manager-toolkit-exploration.md`); this one tracks the product build.

## Authoritative sources (do not re-derive these)

- Product UX + domain model + milestones: `doc/planning/file-manager.md` (product decisions
  resolved 2026-07-05). Everything there stands EXCEPT the stack.
- Stack decision (supersedes the planning doc's Slint sections): GTK4 (gtk4-rs). Evidence in
  `doc/handover/file-manager-toolkit-exploration.md`.
- Perf architecture: fixed-position panes on a canvas, GPU render-node cache, off-thread decode.
  Same handover's "Windows results"; tile principle by analogy from `doc/decision/vector-design.md`
  (which is a DIFFERENT project's doc; only the tile/worker/eviction philosophy is borrowed).
- DnD reference implementations (verified): `doc/troubleshooting/gtk4-windows-outbound-file-drag.md`
  (Win32 OLE shim), `doc/troubleshooting/gtk4-macos-file-dnd.md` (objc2 AppKit shim + inbound
  macOS URI-unescape), `doc/troubleshooting/gtk4-windows-gvsbuild-directcomposition.md`
  (`GDK_DEBUG=dcomp` needed in-process for GPU rendering on Windows).

## Locked decisions

- Package: the GTK4 app reclaims the canonical, function-named `packages/desktop-app/file-manager/`
  (planning doc mandates it so bundle IDs survive a stack fallback). The old Slint sources and their
  fork `[patch.crates-io]` are deleted outright (task #30); nothing salvaged from them. The
  `file-manager-gtk` spike package is retired into this one. `file-manager-qt` is kept as evidence.
- Package identity: crate `file-manager`, lib `file_manager`, bin `monochromatic-file-manager`
  (lib+bin split so the domain model unit-tests without GTK).
- Scope of this pass: the interactive shell (Foundation -> directory listing -> pane strip with
  spawn/dedup/focus + keyboard -> off-thread thumbnails + eviction -> DnD both directions).
  Deferred: session-restore persistence, single-instance IPC transport, fff-core search, the full
  FileOperation/UndoStack, native default-manager registration, packaging, and the AT milestone.

## Interaction model being implemented (from the planning doc)

Niri-like infinite horizontal strip of columns; each column stacks panes vertically. Horizontal =
lineage depth, vertical = panes spawned from the previous column. Single-click spawns a child in the
next column and auto-focuses it (directory -> listing pane; file -> select + preview pane;
Enter/double-click -> open with OS default). Dedup-first (clicking an entry whose pane exists focuses
it); Ctrl+click forces a duplicate; keyboard selection follows the same rules. Panes die only on
explicit close; off-screen panes evict content (snapshots, decoded bitmaps) but never identity;
bulk-close gestures early. Keyboard-primary throughout.

## Module map (as built)

`packages/desktop-app/file-manager/src/`: `main.rs` (thin bin) + `lib.rs` (bootstrap, tracing,
`GDK_DEBUG=dcomp` on Windows, module wiring, controllers kept alive for the app lifetime);
`constants.rs`, `types.rs` (domain data), `model.rs` (`PaneStripState` spawn/dedup/close state
machine), `fs.rs` (reads/metadata/sort); `window.rs` (top-level window + inbound drop target);
`strip.rs` (fixed-canvas board, `reconcile`, spawn/close glue, scroll-to-reveal, Left/Right column
keyboard nav); `pane.rs` (listing pane with single-click-activate + Ctrl-duplicate tracking + close
button, plus the preview-pane builders); `thumbs.rs` (off-thread decode + byte-bounded evicting
texture cache); `dnd.rs` (inbound drop target + cfg-branched outbound drag); `win_drag.rs` (cfg
windows, OLE shim), `mac_drag.rs` (cfg macos, AppKit shim). Tests: `fs_tests.rs`, `model_tests.rs`
(linter-exempt). Spawn/dedup/focus and keyboard nav were folded into `strip.rs`/`pane.rs` rather than
separate `spawn.rs`/`keys.rs`.

## How to build / run

`mise run //packages/desktop-app/file-manager:run` (debug build, runs on native Wayland via
`GDK_BACKEND=wayland`). Tests: `//packages/desktop-app/file-manager:test`. Rust linter (max-lines +
require-rustdoc): `//packages/desktop-app/file-manager:lint:rust`. Types/clippy:
`//packages/desktop-app/file-manager:lint:clippy`.

## Progress log

- 2026-07-08: Plan approved (`/home/user/.claude/plans/lively-zooming-pillow.md`). Handover started.
  Verified the two target packages are standalone crates with no workspace/package.json references
  (only doc-comments in `cli/nested-wayland-session`), so the reclaim needs no registration changes.
- 2026-07-08: Checkpoint 1 (reclaim + Foundation) DONE. Cleared the Slint deck (#30): deleted every
  old Slint source + the fork `[patch.crates-io]`; retired the `file-manager-gtk` spike. Scaffolded
  the GTK4 package at the canonical path (crate `file-manager`, bin `monochromatic-file-manager`,
  lib+bin split): `Cargo.toml` (gtk4 0.11 `v4_10` + tracing trio), `mise.toml` (build/lint/lint:rust/
  test/run, `GDK_BACKEND=wayland`), `README.md`. `src/`: `lib.rs` (`run`: non-blocking tracing +
  `Application` + `GDK_DEBUG=dcomp` on Windows before GDK init + `FM_QUIT_MS` self-quit), `window.rs`
  (`build_window`), `constants.rs`, `main.rs` (thin bin). Calibration: the repo rust linter flags
  every `use` for missing rustdoc (the retired spike never passed it) — code here documents each
  `use`. Verified: debug build clean (30s); `lint:rust` and `lint:clippy` both rc=0; ran the binary
  on native Wayland (`WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-0`) -> `presented top-level window`, self-quit, exit 0.
- 2026-07-08: Checkpoint 2 (domain model + fs reads, #42) DONE. Pure, GTK-free, unit-tested.
  `types.rs` (`PaneId`, `EntryKind`, `PaneLocation`, `FileEntry`, `DirectorySnapshot`), `fs.rs`
  (`read_directory` -> sorted `DirectorySnapshot`; dirs-first case-insensitive sort; best-effort
  per-entry metadata; a bad single entry is skipped with a warning, only a failed dir-open
  propagates), `model.rs` (`PaneStripState`: `open_root`/`spawn_child` with dedup + force-duplicate,
  `focus`, `close`/`close_column`/`close_right_of`, `columns`/`active` accessors). Modules are `pub`
  so they unit-test without GTK and avoid `dead_code` on fields not yet rendered. 11 tests
  (`fs_tests.rs`, `model_tests.rs`, both linter-exempt) cover sort, read+metadata, missing-dir error,
  dedup-and-focus, Ctrl-duplicate, close-clears-dedup, bulk close-column/close-right-of. lint:rust +
  lint:clippy rc=0 (calibration: the linter also requires rustdoc on tuple fields; clippy prefers a
  let-chain over a nested `if`). Next: directory-listing pane rendering a real directory (#43).
- 2026-07-08: Checkpoint 3 (directory-listing pane, #43) DONE. `pane.rs`: `build_listing_pane` builds
  a virtualized `GtkListView` over a `DirectorySnapshot` (`gio::ListStore` of `BoxedAnyObject`-wrapped
  `FileEntry`; `SignalListItemFactory` setup/bind; each row = themed icon by kind + name label) under
  a header showing the directory path. `window.rs` now reads `$HOME` (fallback cwd) via
  `fs::read_directory` and shows the listing pane, or an honest error label on failure. Verified: it
  listed real `$HOME` with `entries=108` (matches `ls -1A | wc -l`), presented the window, zero GTK
  errors, clean exit. A full-screen screenshot was intentionally skipped (it would capture personal
  desktop content, and single-window capture is not reliably targetable here); verification is the
  entry-count match plus the clean render log. Next: fixed-canvas pane strip + spawn/dedup/focus +
  keyboard (#44).
- 2026-07-08: Checkpoint 4a (fixed-canvas strip + spawn/dedup + close, part of #44) DONE.
  `constants.rs` adds `PANE_WIDTH/HEIGHT/GAP` + `FM_AUTOSPAWN`. `strip.rs`: `StripController` over a
  `GtkFixed` inside a `ScrolledWindow`; panes at `(column*(W+GAP), slot*(H+GAP))`, empty cells = no
  widget; `reconcile()` = `remove_stale` + `ensure_pane_widget` (move existing / build+put new, sized
  to the fixed pane box); `spawn_from` maps an activated `FileEntry` to Directory/Preview, calls
  `model.spawn_child` (dedup + column+1), reconciles, idle-defers a scroll-to-reveal, returns the new
  id; `close_pane` closes + reconciles. `pane.rs`: `single_click_activate` + `connect_activate` ->
  `on_activate`; header = ellipsized path label + a `window-close-symbolic` button -> `on_close`.
  `window.rs` returns the controller; `lib.rs` holds controllers for the app lifetime (pane closures
  hold only a `Weak`, so no reference cycle). Verified via `FM_AUTOSPAWN`: spawn -> `panes=2
  columns=2`, then close -> `panes=1`, presented, clean exit. Remaining for #44: Ctrl+click
  force-duplicate and Left/Right keyboard column focus.
- 2026-07-08: Checkpoint 4b (#44 DONE): Ctrl force-duplicate + keyboard column navigation. `pane.rs`:
  `install_force_duplicate_tracking` wires a capture-phase `GestureClick` + an `EventControllerKey`
  feeding a shared `Cell<bool>`; `connect_activate` reads-and-clears it and passes `force_dup` to
  `on_activate` (now `Fn(&FileEntry, bool)`); arrow keys only move selection, so browsing never spawns.
  `strip.rs`: `spawn_from` takes `force_duplicate` -> `model.spawn_child`; tracks `focused_column`;
  `install_column_nav` adds a capture-phase key controller on the scroller mapping Left/Right to
  `focus_relative_column` (grab_focus the adjacent column's first pane), leaving Up/Down to the
  focused list; a spawn grabs focus to the new pane in `scroll_to_pane`'s idle callback.
  Build/lint/test green; autospawn spawn+close unchanged (`panes 2 -> 1`), clean exit. The modifier
  and arrow paths compile and lint; their full boundary check (real Ctrl+click / Left-Right) is manual
  (headless input can't target the window precisely), but the spawn/dedup/force-duplicate/close LOGIC
  is unit-tested. Next: off-thread thumbnails + evicting cache + preview panes (#45).
- 2026-07-08: Checkpoint 5 (off-thread thumbnails + evicting cache + preview panes, #45) DONE. Deps:
  `image` 0.25 (decode) + `async-channel` 2 (worker->main delivery, since glib removed
  `MainContext::channel`). `thumbs.rs`: `Thumbnails::start` spawns a decode worker thread
  (`image::open` -> `thumbnail(THUMB_SIZE)` -> RGBA) that delivers `(path, Option<Decoded>)` over an
  async channel drained by `glib::spawn_future_local` on the main context; `deliver` builds a
  `MemoryTexture`, inserts into a byte-bounded LRU (`evict_to_budget` keeps the total under
  `THUMB_CACHE_BYTES` = 64 MB), and fulfils every waiting `Picture`; `request` deduplicates concurrent
  requests per path and serves cache hits immediately (`touch` bumps the LRU tick). `is_image` gates
  by extension. `pane.rs`: `build_preview_pane` (header + close) over `build_preview_body` (image ->
  off-thread `Picture`, else a large themed icon + name); the preview builders live here to keep
  `strip.rs` under max-lines (split when it hit 312). `strip.rs`'s Preview arm calls it with a close
  closure; `StripInner` owns the `Thumbnails`. Verified via `FM_START_DIR=/usr/share/pixmaps
  FM_AUTOPREVIEW`: preview spawned (`panes=2`), `thumbnail ready path=.../cupsprinter.png width=256
  height=256 cache_bytes=262144` (= 256*256*4), clean exit -> decode ran off-thread, texture built +
  cached with exact byte accounting, `Picture` updated. Full browse-many-images eviction is trusted
  from the LRU logic (only one thumbnail here, well under the cap). Next: DnD wiring (#46).
- 2026-07-08: Checkpoint 6 (DnD wiring, #46) DONE. `Cargo.toml`: target-gated `windows` 0.58 + `objc2`
  0.6 shim deps (compiled only on their OS). `dnd.rs`: inbound `install_drop_target` attaches a
  `GtkDropTarget` (`GdkFileList`, copy) to the window, logging each dropped file's recovered path +
  uri (`recover_path` falls back to `glib::Uri::unescape_string` for the macOS scheme-colon encoding).
  Outbound `install_file_drag` is cfg-branched: Wayland -> `GtkDragSource` with a `text/uri-list`
  content provider; windows -> `GtkGestureDrag` -> `win_drag::start_file_drag` (OLE shim); macos ->
  `GtkGestureDrag` -> `mac_drag::start_file_drag` (AppKit shim). `win_drag.rs` + `mac_drag.rs` ported
  verbatim from the verified troubleshooting-doc/scratchpad references, with rustdoc added on their
  `use`s/`impl` so the linter (which parses all `.rs` regardless of cfg) passes. Wired: the window
  gets the drop target; a preview pane's body (Picture / icon box) gets the outbound drag.
  Build/lint:rust (checks the win/mac files too)/clippy/test all green; ran clean with DnD installed
  (no errors, clean exit). Live drag verification (real Dolphin <-> app) is MANUAL: headless cannot
  synthesize a Wayland drag gesture, and these are the exact `GtkDropTarget`/`GtkDragSource` APIs the
  spike already verified with real Dolphin. Outbound is currently from preview panes (single-file, no
  click/virtualization conflict); dragging listing ROWS out is a documented refinement (needs
  drag-vs-activate arbitration + per-row path tracking). macOS/Windows shim at-boundary verification
  rides the m1/x13-win pass. Next: #47 final at-boundary verification + README/package completeness.
- 2026-07-08: Checkpoint 7 (#47, first-pass verification + completeness) DONE. The interactive shell
  is complete on Linux. Final green sweep: `lint`, `lint:rust`, `lint:clippy`, `test` (11) all rc=0;
  15 source files. Release artifact (`build`) verified at the boundary: (A) real `$HOME` autospawn ->
  `spawned panes=2 columns=2` then `closed panes=1`, presented, exit 0; (B) `/usr/share/pixmaps`
  autopreview -> off-thread `thumbnail ready 256x256 cache_bytes=262144`, presented, exit 0. Package
  completeness (PKG): `README.md` present, zero lint errors, unit tests cover the pure exported paths
  (model spawn/dedup/close, fs read+sort); GTK-coupled paths (strip reconcile, thumbnail decode/cache,
  DnD install) are runtime-verified via the autospawn/autopreview hooks and clean-run logs.

  What is verified automatically vs still manual:
  - Automatic (at boundary, this machine): build/lint/test; native Wayland window; real-directory
    listing (108-entry `$HOME` match); spawn -> next-column child + dedup+close reconcile;
    off-thread thumbnail decode + cache byte accounting; clean teardown (exit 0) on every run.
  - Manual (needs a human / another machine): live Ctrl+click duplicate, Left/Right column focus, and
    real Dolphin <-> app drag-and-drop (headless can't synthesize Wayland pointer/drag input); and the
    Windows OLE + macOS AppKit outbound shims (compiled behind cfg + linter-clean here, at-boundary
    on the x13-win/m1 pass).

  Deferred (designed, not built this pass): session-restore persistence, single-instance IPC,
  fff-core search, the full FileOperation/UndoStack (copy/move/rename/trash/delete + inverse undo),
  native default-manager registration, packaging/signing, the AT semantics milestone, dragging listing
  ROWS out (needs drag-vs-activate arbitration + per-row path tracking; outbound is preview-pane-only
  today), and drop-INTO-a-directory as a real file operation (inbound currently accepts + logs).
- 2026-07-08: Live-test fix (auto-scroll). Hands-on testing surfaced that a spawned pane did not
  scroll fully into view, and a stacked sibling looked "off by one" (the scroll revealed the pane
  ABOVE the new one). Root cause: the idle-based reveal retry spun through every attempt before GTK
  ran layout, so it clamped against stale scroll bounds. Fix (`strip.rs`): retry on an 8 ms timer
  (`REVEAL_INTERVAL_MS`) so the frame clock runs layout between attempts and the adjustment `upper`
  is current; `reveal` now returns whether the pane is fully visible so the retry stops on success.
  Also extracted the Left/Right column nav to a new `keys.rs` (made `StripInner` `pub(crate)`) to
  keep `strip.rs` under max-lines, and added the spawned entry path to the spawn log. Confirmed live:
  `revealed=true` on the first timed attempt with `v_value` 0/252/784 against `v_upper` 800/1052/1584
  for slots 0/1/2; `entry=` matches the clicked folder, so click->spawn had no real off-by-one.
- 2026-07-08: Live-test UX pass. (1) Row alignment: replaced the "append to column" pane model with
  an explicit pane TREE (each pane has a `parent`) laid out by an iterative pre-order tidy layout
  (`model.rs` `relayout`): a node's row = the next free leaf-row when the walk enters it, so a child
  aligns to its parent's row and a later sibling starts below the previous sibling's whole subtree.
  Every spawn/close re-lays-out and `reconcile` repositions existing panes as subtrees grow. Confirmed
  live (the `.dbus` case: a sibling pushes below a grown subtree) and by 13 model tests (added
  alignment + sibling-pushdown). (2) Black background: `style.rs` installs a `#000` `CssProvider` at
  application priority; confirmed. Open requirement: the clicked PARENT must stay fully in view and
  not jump when a child spawns (the user suggests "detach columns" = independent per-column vertical
  scroll); clarifying exact behavior before that scroll refactor.
- 2026-07-08: Detached-column strip, STAGE 1 (structure + independent scroll). Confirmed model with
  the user: each column scrolls vertically on its own, but a parent is tethered inside its children
  block's vertical span (top never above the block top, bottom never below the block bottom), and the
  columns scroll together at the tether boundary; also minimize partially-clipped panes. Stage 1
  re-architected `strip.rs` from one shared `GtkFixed` canvas to per-column vertical `ScrolledWindow`s
  (each over a `Fixed`, scrollbar hidden via `External` policy) inside one horizontal outer
  `ScrolledWindow`; panes placed at `row_y(row)` within their column; every column shares one content
  height so equal offsets align rows. Extracted scroll/reveal into `scroll.rs` (reveal reveals the
  column in the outer horizontal + the row in the column). Note: this session gives GtkApplication no
  D-Bus single-instance lock, so relaunches pile up windows -- always kill before relaunch. Confirmed
  live: one window, tree layout intact, each column wheel-scrolls independently. STAGE 2 next: the
  parent-within-children tether coupling; STAGE 3: snap to keep panes fully visible.
- 2026-07-08: Detached-column strip, STAGE 2 (tether) DONE. Each column's vadjustment
  `value-changed` calls `scroll.rs` `enforce_tether(initiator)`: with the initiator column's scroll
  fixed, neighbors clamp outward so the relative offset (child column minus parent column) stays in
  `[0, slack]`, where slack per pair = min over the left column's parents of `(deepest child row -
  parent row) * ROW_STRIDE`. The right pass keeps the child column in `[parent, parent+slack]`; the
  left pass keeps the parent column in `[child-slack, child]`; a re-entrancy guard
  (`StripInner.tethering`) ignores the `value-changed` the clamps themselves fire. Confirmed live: a
  child column can't scroll its contents above the parent, and the columns couple at the boundary.
  STAGE 3 next: snap offsets so as few panes as possible are partially clipped (the user sees a pane
  land not-fully-in-viewport on scroll-down).
- 2026-07-08: STAGE 3 (snap) is WIP and PAUSED for the day (session got long; the exact requirement
  wording outran a confident implementation). State:
  - `scroll.rs` `snap_columns` (debounced `SNAP_DELAY_MS` after the last scroll, via a
    `scroll_epoch`): rounds each column's vertical offset to its own nearest pane-height boundary,
    clamped to `[0, max]`, INDEPENDENTLY (an earlier version folded the tether in and dragged
    down-scrolled columns back to the top; that was fixed to independent rounding).
  - OPEN BUG: the user reports "scroll the rightmost column down to the end, it snaps back to the
    beginning soon after." Not yet root-caused. Debug offset logging is IN (`tracing::debug!`
    "tether pass" with per-column offsets, and "snap column" before/after/max/page/upper) -- reproduce
    with `RUST_LOG=file_manager=debug` and read the offsets to see which column resets and whether
    `max`/`upper` are as expected.
  - Likely-relevant facts to check next time: (a) there are TWO vertical scrolls -- the COLUMN scroll
    (moves whole panes; the tether+snap act here) and each pane's FILE-LIST scroll (independent,
    untouched); wheel routing between them may confuse which one moves. (b) every column's canvas is
    sized to the GLOBAL max content height (`set_content_height`) so equal offsets align rows, which
    means a short column can scroll DOWN into empty space below its panes -- reconsider whether that
    is desired. (c) panes are `PANE_HEIGHT=520` tall, so only ~1.7 fit per viewport -> at least one
    pane is always partly clipped; a smaller `PANE_HEIGHT` may make the snap moot.
  - UNRESOLVED REQUIREMENT: "tint each pane's available scroll region" / what exactly the snap should
    do -- the phrasing wasn't fully understood this session; clarify before more snap changes.
  - DEBUG SCAFFOLDING (gated, safe to keep or delete): `FM_DEBUG_TINT=1` loads `style.rs` `DEBUG_CSS`
    tinting `.fm-column` (per-column hue by `nth-child`), `.fm-canvas` (orange, the scrollable
    canvas), `.fm-pane` (pink border), `.fm-header` (purple), `.fm-list` (teal, the file-list scroll
    area). Widgets carry those classes (`strip.rs` columns; `pane.rs` container/header/list).
  - RESUME: `pkill -9 -f /monochromatic-file-manager` (this session has no D-Bus single-instance
    lock, so kill before relaunch), rebuild, run with `FM_DEBUG_TINT=1 RUST_LOG=file_manager=debug`,
    reproduce the snap-back, read the offset log. Committed up to STAGE 2 (tether) as working; STAGE 3
    (snap) + debug scaffolding committed as WIP.
- 2026-07-08: Session paused (touch grass). Open regression left IN PLACE (per user "keep the
  change") as a repro to investigate next session: adding `.fm-canvas { background-color: ... }` to
  `DEBUG_CSS` (tinting the scrollable `GtkFixed` inside each column -- the "available scroll region")
  makes the whole window render PURE BLACK, and ALL the other debug tints vanish too. So a background
  on the scroll-content `GtkFixed` appears to break the entire `DEBUG_CSS` provider (a GTK CSS
  parse/load failure would drop every rule -> back to the base black; likely candidates: the Fixed
  overdrawing its children, or `load_from_data` rejecting the sheet). First thing to try next time:
  run with `FM_DEBUG_TINT=1` and read stderr for a Gtk-CSS/GLib `WARNING`/`CRITICAL` about the
  stylesheet; if the sheet is being dropped wholesale, split `.fm-canvas` into its own provider to
  isolate it, or move the tint onto a child overlay instead of the Fixed. Everything else stands;
  resume the snap (STAGE 3) with a fresh head.
- 2026-07-08: Layout seam refactor. `strip.rs` now owns only the controller duties: mutate
  `PaneStripState`, build pane widgets, and hand `PanePlacement` snapshots to `layout.rs`.
  New `layout.rs` owns the GTK strip adapter: outer horizontal scroller, per-column vertical
  scrollers, `GtkFixed` canvases, widget map, focused-column state, and reconciliation. The former
  `scroll.rs` logic moved under `layout/scroll.rs`, still private to the layout seam, so reveal,
  tether, and snap no longer reach through `StripInner` for model or widget fields. This preserves
  current behavior while making the remaining snap bug a layout-adapter problem instead of a
  controller-plus-scroll cross-cutting problem.
- 2026-07-08: Tinted live-debug fix. User screenshot showed two separate problems: short columns
  inherited another column's deeper content height, producing huge tinted blank scroll regions, and
  snapping rounded `252 / 532` to row 0 before clamping, so a short `0..252` scroll range always
  snapped back to the top. Fix: `layout.rs` now sizes each column canvas to that column's deepest
  pane row (while keeping global row coordinates for pane placement), and `layout/scroll.rs`
  chooses the nearest reachable snap candidate by clamping both neighboring row-boundaries first, so
  bottom-of-range is a valid snap point. Verified lint/check/clippy/tests; reopened tinted debug run
  for live user verification.
- 2026-07-08: Labeled debug tint pass. User clarified that the green pane bodies were misleading and
  asked for every debug-relevant region to be tinted/labeled with visible descriptions plus short
  codes. Added `debug_tint.rs`; currently enabled visible labels are `V6C` column fixed pane canvas,
  `Y6L` immediate-child shared lane, and `B6P` preview body. Removed the green list/body fill;
  outer-strip, column-scroller, header, list-viewport, realized-row, and pane-shell labels are
  intentionally disabled while lane behavior is the focus. Immediate-child lanes are explicit
  debug-only rounded green boxes keyed by parent pane id and labeled with parent, column span, child
  count, and row extent. Verified lint/check/rust-lint/clippy/tests before reopening.
- 2026-07-09: App-owned lane scrolling. User clarified that full columns should not be scrollers,
  and refined the scroll model after earlier lane-capture versions made some states unscrollable and
  swallowed wheel events: vertical wheel/trackpad input belongs to the whole app first, while each
  sibling-group lane independently tries to stay visible within its own green-box limit. A lane is
  still a parent plus direct children. `layout.rs` now uses static per-column `GtkFixed` canvases
  inside one horizontal+vertical outer `ScrolledWindow`; per-column vertical `ScrolledWindow`s were
  removed. `layout/lane.rs` owns lane sticky offsets driven by the outer vertical adjustment,
  hierarchical offset application, vertical reveal, and rounded green `Y6L` overlays. `Y6L` boxes
  are fixed rails in app-layout coordinates; only panes receive sticky offsets inside those rails.
  Pane positioning resolves per column with forward/backward spacing passes, so panes keep
  `PANE_HEIGHT + PANE_GAP` separation while staying inside every `Y6L` rail they belong to. Lane
  offsets apply through the parent lane for non-root panes; root panes have no parent lane, so they
  use their own root lane. This prevents parent panes with their own children from double-moving into
  siblings while still letting the root stick inside its root rail.
  `layout/scroll.rs` now only handles horizontal reveal and the shared row-pixel helper.
  `debug_tint::wrap` mirrors wrapped-child expand flags so wrappers do not create fake debug
  geometry.
- 2026-07-09: Layout approved. Human verification on the live `file-manager-lane-tint` run approved
  the app-owned vertical scroll model with static columns, fixed `Y6L` rails, non-overlapping panes,
  and root-pane stickiness. Treat this layout behavior as the accepted baseline for the next file
  manager iteration.
