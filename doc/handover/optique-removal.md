# Optique removal handover

## Status

Planning and user grilling are in progress.
No parser implementation or consumer migration is authorized until the user confirms shared understanding.

Keep this handover current when requirements,
decisions,
evidence,
rejected designs,
or the next action change.

## User intent

- Replace Optique with a repository-owned parser based on Valibot.
- Migrate existing Optique consumers,
  except `package/git-policy/cli/`.
- Include the paused consumer under `package-paused/dev-script/inference-canary/`.
- Do not expand this migration to handwritten parsers that do not use Optique.
- Preserve historical troubleshooting records,
  marking superseded recommendations where appropriate rather than deleting durable evidence.
- Settle observable parser results and grammar before choosing implementation architecture.
- Ask one decision question at a time.
- Demonstrate every concept in an option comparison with a concrete sketch.

## Settled scope

The active workspace has thirteen non-cli-git manifests declaring an Optique dependency.
`package/cli/mutation-test/package.json` has no matching source import and appears to contain stale dependencies.

Current non-cli-git source imports occur in twenty-one TypeScript files across these consumers:

- `package/build-tool/css/`
- `package/claude-code-plugin/source/`
- `package/cli/fy/`
- `package/cli/git-clone-size/`
- `package/cli/mvm/`
- `package/cli/vmsync/`
- `package/dev-script/backup-path/`
- `package/dev-script/task-util/`
- `package/dev-script/watch-restart/`
- `package/module/image-diff/`
- `package/module/token-count/`
- `package/pi-plugin/spawn/`

`package/test-fixture/oxlint-no-restricted-syntax/` also imports Optique as a lint fixture.
The migration must replace that fixture without changing the rule it tests.

`package/git-policy/cli/` is explicitly out of scope,
including concurrent work replacing its parser.
Do not edit,
move,
or absorb that work into this migration.
Optique catalog and lockfile entries may therefore remain while cli-git still needs them.
Success is no Optique dependency or import outside cli-git,
not zero repository-wide string matches.

## Current result-shape proposal

The user prefers a command grammar whose structured options precede a required `--` separator.
Every token after the separator is captured without option interpretation:

```text
image-tool compare
  [-p, --provider voyage|gemini]
  [-t, --tag <TAG> [<TAG> ...]]
  [--json]
  -- <1> <2> [<3> ...]

image-tool cmp ...    hidden alias for compare
```

The proposed successful result is:

```ts
{
  commandPath: ['compare'],
  trailingArguments: ['a.png', 'b.png'],
  provider: 'voyage',
  tags: ['release', 'nightly'],
  json: true,
}
```

The proposed static shape is:

```ts
type CompareArgs = Readonly<{
  commandPath: readonly ['compare'];
  trailingArguments: readonly [string, string, ...string[]];
  provider?: 'voyage' | 'gemini';
  json?: true;
  tags?: readonly [string, ...string[]];
}>;
```

Valibot `1.4.2` can represent the non-empty tuple tail directly:

```ts
const trailingArgumentsSchema = v.tupleWithRest(
  [
    v.string(),
    v.string(),
  ],
  v.string(),
);
```

This proposal deliberately avoids assigning semantic field names to tail positions.
The parser should preserve tail order and accept dash-led values after `--` verbatim.
The command alias `cmp` should canonicalize to `commandPath: ['compare']` and remain absent from generated help.

## Settled result-shape decisions

- `provider` is omitted when `--provider` is absent.
  The parser does not choose a provider or implement the command's business policy.
- `trailingArguments` preserves a schema-constrained tail after `--`.
- Commands accept arguments only through a required `--` separator.
  Options occur before it;
  every later token is preserved as tail data without option interpretation.
- The shared parser has no named-positional feature.
  Commands without arguments require no separator.
- Each command's syntax-level Valibot schema defines its tail cardinality.
- Presence flags use absent-or-`true` rather than always-present booleans.
- Collection-valued option output uses an optional non-empty tuple.
  For example,
  absent `--tag` omits `tags`,
  while one valid occurrence can produce `tags?: readonly [string, ...string[]]`.
- Repeating `--tag` is invalid.
  Output cardinality does not imply repeated option occurrences.
- One `--tag` occurrence consumes one or more plain argv tokens until the next option or final `--`.
  A dash-led token ends the collection and is interpreted as an option.
  Dash-led tag values are not supported by this syntax.
- Every declared option may occur at most once,
  regardless of whether repeated occurrences use the same spelling or different aliases.
  Duplicate scalar,
  presence,
  and collection-valued options are usage errors;
  no occurrence silently overrides or merges another.
- Valued options accept only separate value tokens.
  Joined long values such as `--provider=voyage` and attached short values such as `-pvoyage` are unknown options.
  Scalar and variadic options use the same separation rule.
- Short aliases must occupy exact argv tokens.
  Clusters such as `-jq` and `-jqp` are unknown options even when each character names a declared alias.
- Long options match exact declared aliases only.
  Unambiguous prefixes and fuzzy corrections are not accepted syntax;
  they may appear only as non-executing diagnostic suggestions.
- Result cardinality preserves syntax:
  zero-or-one uses `value?: T`,
  zero-or-many uses `values?: readonly [T, ...T[]]`,
  and one-or-many uses `values: readonly [T, ...T[]]`.
- Generated help uses display-only metavars for tail positions and rest values.
  Metavars improve usage and missing-value diagnostics but never become result keys.
- A commandless CLI is a root leaf and has no `commandPath` property.
  The parser never invents a program-name path absent from argv.
- Subcommands may nest to arbitrary declared depth,
  as in `cat calico meow --loud`.
- Intermediate command nodes are routing-only.
  Only the innermost leaf command may declare options or a trailing-argument tail.
- Command-bearing results flatten canonical command tokens into a readonly non-empty `commandPath` tuple.
  Leaf options and `trailingArguments` remain top-level properties.
  A single-level command uses `commandPath: readonly ['compare']`;
  nested syntax can use `commandPath: readonly ['calico', 'meow']`.
- Hidden aliases canonicalize their own path segment before output.
- Each leaf may apply a whole-result Valibot schema after field parsing to validate relationships across supplied options and trailing arguments.
  This schema may transform values while preserving declared field layout,
  but may not rename,
  nest,
  remove,
  merge,
  add,
  or default result fields.
  It may not consult external state.
  Failed relationship checks are parser failures with status 2.
- Syntax schemas are synchronous only.
  Async Valibot schemas are rejected during definition validation;
  async work begins after successful parsing.
- `--help` and `-h` produce contextual help at the root,
  every intermediate route,
  and every leaf.
  They are exact reserved parser controls and never appear in an application success value or reach the application handler.
- A control-position help spelling is exclusive:
  combining it with an option,
  another command token after it,
  or a trailing-argument separator is a usage error.
  Command tokens before it select the help context and do not count as a combination.
- Literal `--help` and `-h` tokens after the trailing-argument separator remain data under the settled separator rule.
- Contextual help writes to stdout and settles with status 0.
  Parser usage and validation failures write every independently recoverable diagnostic followed by full contextual help to stderr and settle with status 2.
  Grammar issues are ordered by argv token index,
  tail issues follow option-region issues,
  and independent Valibot issues preserve schema order.
  Recovery proceeds only from known token boundaries and never reinterprets input to manufacture cascades.
  Failure help uses the deepest canonically resolved command route,
  even when argv used aliases.
  Neither path invokes the application handler.
  Application failures retain their own status and output policy.

## Unresolved result-shape decisions

No known result-shape decision remains open.
Other grammar and diagnostic decisions remain open.

## Architecture discussion

Three implementation models were demonstrated but not selected:

- CLI descriptors containing Valibot schemas.
- A Valibot result schema plus separate token bindings.
- CLI metadata attached to Valibot schemas.

The grammar and successful result interface are now sufficiently settled to revisit the module seam.
A thin wrapper that merely calls `v.parse` has no reason to exist.
The owned module must earn its keep by compiling and enforcing argv grammar around Valibot validation.

Candidate owned responsibilities are:

- validate and compile command-tree definitions once;
- route exact canonical commands and aliases into a `commandPath`;
- enforce routing-only intermediate nodes and leaf-only options;
- scan exact option tokens,
  separate values,
  variadic option values,
  duplicate occurrences,
  and the required trailing separator;
- assemble syntax-preserving result cardinality and omission;
- invoke synchronous Valibot schemas at the correct token boundaries;
- map Valibot issues to argv indices,
  spellings,
  metavars,
  and deterministic aggregated diagnostics;
- generate contextual help for every route;
- gate application dispatch and implement stdout/status 0 help plus stderr/status 2 failures.

Valibot remains the value and relationship validation engine behind this grammar seam.
It is not the whole parser.

The user accepted this value proposition and module seam.
`compileCli(definition)` is the deep core:
it validates and compiles grammar,
precomputes routing and help,
and returns pure parsing and rendering behavior.
A process adapter such as `runCli` owns argv and stream integration plus application dispatch gating.
The application callback receives only successful syntax results.

## Speculative representations beyond the first three

The user suspects a materially better definition model than all three demonstrated options.
That suspicion is credible.
The first comparison treated a handwritten whole-result schema as inevitable,
which created duplication that the compiler may be able to eliminate.
No representation below is accepted yet.

### Leading speculation: grammar algebra with derived schema

Make an owned grammar algebra the only source of argv structure.
Each field constructor contributes:

- token grammar;
- help metadata;
- occurrence cardinality;
- a synchronous Valibot value schema;
- its inferred output field type.

`compileCli` derives the leaf result type and synthesizes whole-result Valibot validation.
The user never repeats the assembled object shape.

```ts
const meow = leaf({
  options: {
    volume: valueOption({
      names: ['--volume'],
      metavar: 'LEVEL',
      description: 'Volume from 0 to 10.',
      schema: v.pipe(
        v.string(),
        v.transform(Number,),
        v.number(),
        v.minValue(0,),
        v.maxValue(10,),
      ),
    },),
    tags: variadicOption({
      names: ['--tag'],
      metavar: 'TAG',
      description: 'One or more tags.',
      itemSchema: v.string(),
    },),
    loud: presenceOption({
      names: ['--loud'],
      description: 'Use loud output.',
    },),
  },
  trailingArguments: trailing({
    items: [
      {
        metavar: 'FIRST-SOUND',
        schema: v.string(),
      },
      {
        metavar: 'SECOND-SOUND',
        schema: v.string(),
      },
    ],
    rest: {
      metavar: 'ADDITIONAL-SOUND',
      schema: v.string(),
    },
  },),
},).check(
  v.check(
    function loudHasVolume(result,) {
      return result.loud !== true
        || result.volume !== undefined;
    },
    '--loud requires --volume.',
  ),
);

const catGrammar = program({
  name: 'cat',
  commands: {
    calico: route({
      aliases: [
        {
          name: 'c',
          hidden: true,
        },
      ],
      commands: {
        meow,
      },
    },),
  },
},);

export type CatCliResult = CliOutput<typeof catGrammar>;

export const catCli: CompiledCli<CatCliResult> = compileCli(catGrammar,);
```

The intended derived leaf member is:

```ts
type MeowCliResult = Readonly<{
  commandPath: readonly ['calico', 'meow'];
  volume?: number;
  tags?: readonly [string, ...string[]];
  loud?: true;
  trailingArguments: readonly [string, string, ...string[]];
}>;
```

The compiler can synthesize a Valibot object schema internally from public constructors:

- scalar value option becomes an optional entry whose output is `v.InferOutput` of its value schema;
- presence option becomes an optional literal-`true` entry;
- variadic option maps its item schema over a grammar-enforced non-empty tuple;
- trailing items and rest schemas derive the exact output tuple;
- canonical route nodes derive the literal `commandPath` tuple;
- `.check(...)` contributes shape-preserving whole-result validation without a duplicate object schema.

This is not arbitrary parser-combinator composition.
It is a closed owned algebra that compiles into one immutable grammar AST.
The internal AST may resemble descriptor-first design,
but callers no longer maintain a parallel whole-result schema.

Why it may beat the first three designs:

- unlike descriptor plus `resultSchema`,
  it does not repeat field layout;
- unlike schema plus bindings,
  grammar cardinality and output cardinality come from one field node;
- unlike Valibot metadata,
  it does not inspect arbitrary schema wrappers or depend on beta metadata;
- unlike an Optique-compatible algebra,
  it exposes only repository-approved grammar forms.

### Variant: result-first grammar field wrappers

Another possibility is to make owned field wrappers feel schema-first without attaching metadata to arbitrary schemas:

```ts
const meow = cliLeaf({
  volume: cliValue({
    names: ['--volume'],
    schema: volumeSchema,
    metavar: 'LEVEL',
  },),
  tags: cliVariadic({
    names: ['--tag'],
    itemSchema: v.string(),
    metavar: 'TAG',
  },),
  loud: cliPresence({
    names: ['--loud'],
  },),
  trailingArguments: cliTrailing({
    items: [firstSound, secondSound],
    rest: additionalSound,
  },),
},);
```

Each wrapper is an owned grammar node containing a Valibot schema,
not itself a Valibot `BaseSchema`.
`compileCli` recognizes only these owned nodes.

Do not implement grammar nodes as custom Valibot schemas without a source prototype.
The installed Valibot `1.4.2` `BaseSchema` protocol exposes `~run` and `~standard` as internal members.
Depending on that protocol would recreate the coupling rejected in the metadata design.

This variant may simply be a naming and layout form of the leading grammar algebra.
Its value is worth testing through real declarations before treating it as a separate architecture.

### Variant: compiled argv codec

The compiled result could expose a schema-like codec from argv to syntax output:

```ts
const catCli = compileCli(catGrammar,);

const parsed = catCli.parse(argv,);

// Speculative only:
const argvSchema: StandardSchemaV1<readonly string[], CatCliResult> = catCli.schema;
```

This would make the entire grammar composable as a schema from `readonly string[]` to the inferred result.
It could support consumer pipelines after syntax parsing.

Risks:

- help requests and aggregated provenance diagnostics are not ordinary value-validation failures;
- a Valibot-compatible implementation may require internal schema protocol members;
- schema composition could bypass the process adapter's help and status contracts;
- exposing both `.parse` and `.schema` may create two public seams.

Treat the codec as an optional adapter only if a prototype can use public Standard Schema contracts without weakening parser controls.
It is not the leading core representation.

### Variant: event grammar as an internal implementation

The scanner could emit a provenance-preserving event stream before result assembly:

```ts
type CliEvent =
  | Readonly<{ kind: 'command'; tokenIndex: number; canonical: string; }>
  | Readonly<{ kind: 'option'; tokenIndex: number; key: string; spelling: string; }>
  | Readonly<{ kind: 'value'; tokenIndex: number; optionKey: string; value: string; }>
  | Readonly<{ kind: 'separator'; tokenIndex: number; }>
  | Readonly<{ kind: 'trailing'; tokenIndex: number; value: string; }>;
```

A reducer would apply field schemas,
assemble the syntax result,
and aggregate diagnostics using original token provenance.
This may simplify deterministic recovery and error ordering.

It is probably an internal representation,
not a user-facing definition model.
Users should declare grammar roles,
not construct parser events.

### Variant: handler-first leaf modules

A leaf could optionally bundle its application handler:

```ts
const meowModule = leafModule({
  grammar: meow,
  run: async function runMeow(value,) {
    // Application work.
  },
},);
```

This can remove external dispatch boilerplate,
but it must remain a layer above independently parseable grammar.
Making handlers the grammar source would couple application work to parser tests and weaken the accepted seam.
Do not use this as the core representation.

### Prototype gates before selecting a representation

The leading grammar-algebra idea needs evidence before becoming the public interface.
A future prototype should prove:

- nested canonical paths infer literal readonly tuples;
- scalar transforms infer transformed optional values;
- presence options infer absent-or-`true`;
- variadic options infer optional non-empty readonly tuples;
- trailing item and rest schemas infer required readonly tuples;
- hidden aliases do not widen canonical path literals;
- cross-field checks receive the synthesized leaf type without annotations;
- shape-changing checks or defaults cannot enter syntax declarations;
- async schemas fail definition validation;
- exported grammars compile under `--isolatedDeclarations` with explicit `CompiledCli<Result>` annotations;
- implementation uses public Valibot constructors and parsing methods only;
- no user-written whole-result object schema is required;
- scanner events retain token provenance for aggregated diagnostics;
- root leaf,
  nested command,
  variadic option,
  and required-tail fixtures all exercise the same interface.

Representative prototype consumers should include:

- a root leaf such as `package/module/token-count/`;
- a subcommand CLI such as `package/cli/mvm/` or `package/cli/vmsync/`;
- a variadic forwarding CLI such as `package/dev-script/watch-restart/` or `package/cli/fy/`.

The prototype is a design probe,
not authorization to implement or migrate packages.
Do not finalize package names or exported interfaces before these gates pass.

## Existing consumer constraints

Current consumers exercise:

- named and repeated options;
- presence flags and defaulted options;
- required,
  optional,
  and repeated positional arguments;
- subcommands and hidden aliases;
- generated help;
- integer conversion and picklists;
- command-tail forwarding through `--`;
- mapping parser output into discriminated command-path unions.

Current unseparated positional syntax will not survive unchanged.
The repository controls these contracts and rejects named positionals as a parser design.
Do not add compatibility shims for existing positional forms.
The plan must distinguish this intentional interface change from accidental parser regressions.
Before migration,
each in-scope CLI needs executable grammar fixtures for accepted input,
rejected input,
help,
`--`,
repetition,
defaults,
and output shape.

## Durable design principles

- Parsing is pure and does not read or mutate `process`.
- Help and failures are structured parse outcomes before rendering.
- Process argv access,
  stream writes,
  and exit-code policy sit at an entrypoint adapter.
- Valibot owns runtime value and relationship validation plus output typing.
- The module owns command-tree compilation,
  argv token grammar,
  syntax-result assembly,
  contextual help,
  diagnostic projection,
  and application dispatch gating.
  Merely forwarding a value to `v.parse` is explicitly insufficient.
- `compileCli` is the core seam.
  It compiles definitions once and returns pure grammar behavior.
  `runCli` is a process adapter,
  not the parser core.
- Syntax-level Valibot schemas may transform values and change their runtime representation.
  For example,
  `cpus: '4'` may become `cpus: 4` while retaining the same field in the syntax result.
  Invalid transformed values remain parser failures with status 2.
- The parser reports schema outputs and structural absence.
  Every absent option is omitted from the syntax result.
  CLI-layer schemas may not supply defaults,
  and the parser may not add `undefined`,
  empty collections,
  or false sentinels for absence.
  Effective defaults belong to consumer-owned shape conversion or application logic.
  The parser does not choose domain defaults or perform business logic.
- Canonical business-shape conversion uses a consumer-owned Valibot schema to parse the syntax result again:

  ```ts
  const options = v.parse(commandOptionsSchema, parsed.value,);
  ```

  The second parse is for invasive shape changes such as semantic renaming,
  rearranging tuple elements into named fields,
  changing nesting,
  or otherwise reorganizing the parser result.
  Routine value conversion does not require a second parse.
- Leaf-level whole-result validation may enforce CLI-contract relationships before application dispatch.
  It preserves syntax-derived shape and cannot perform external-state or business-policy checks.
- The owned parser exposes no Optique-compatible parser-state generic surface.
- Consumer and parser tests cross the same public interface.
- Unknown options are rejected before `--` and preserved after `--`.
- Plain tokens before `--` are valid only while a declared variadic option is consuming values.
- Option occurrence identity is canonical across aliases,
  so `-p` followed by `--provider` is a duplicate.
- Option tokens contain one exact declared spelling only;
  values always occupy following argv tokens,
  short aliases never cluster,
  and long aliases never abbreviate or autocorrect.
- Every argument-bearing command uses a required separated tail;
  named positionals and optional-separator compatibility paths are forbidden.
- Tail metavars are presentation-only metadata.
  Parser output remains `trailingArguments` regardless of displayed role names.
- Hidden aliases parse to canonical command-path segments and do not render in help.
- Intermediate subcommands own no options or arguments;
  only the innermost command is a leaf parser.
- Root leaves omit `commandPath`;
  command paths exist only for command tokens supplied in argv.
- Nested subcommand grammar is required and cannot have a fixed depth limit.
- Command results are flat:
  `commandPath` preserves routing syntax while leaf options and trailing arguments stay at the result root.
- Help and parser failures are handled before application dispatch.
  The application receives neither controls nor parser-failure outcomes as business input.
- Parser controls use stdout and status 0;
  parser failures use stderr and status 2.
  Every parser failure appends full contextual help after the diagnostic rather than printing a separate help-command hint.
  Application status 1 remains distinguishable from invalid invocation.
- Syntax parsing accepts synchronous Valibot schemas only.
  Async schemas fail definition validation.
- Parser failures aggregate all independently provable issues.
  Diagnostics have deterministic argv order,
  full help renders once,
  and recovery-safe scanning must not create secondary interpretations.
- `--help` and `-h` are valid at every route
  only when no other control-position syntax accompanies them.
  After `--`,
  the same tokens are ordinary trailing data.

## Communication-rule commits

- `82d90270c` added `ODM` so option examples must demonstrate every compared concept.
- `ad0153c2a` removed wording that could excuse an omitted sketch.
- `53903e603` added `OCG` so result cardinality cannot silently determine option occurrence grammar.

## Concurrent worktree state

Independent cli-git work is modifying `package/git-policy/cli/` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
Treat these as concurrent user-controlled changes under rule `EC1`.
Do not restore,
stash,
revert,
or include them in this migration's commits.

## Next action

When the user returns,
start from the speculative grammar-algebra section rather than re-presenting the first three designs.
Ask whether grammar-derived schema synthesis is closer to the missing fourth direction.
If the user authorizes a design probe,
build a throwaway compile-only prototype against Valibot `1.4.2` and the listed type gates before choosing a public interface.
Continue updating this handover as hypotheses are accepted or rejected.
