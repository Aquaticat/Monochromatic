# iPhone X code-signing for the iOS framework vet

How development builds are signed and run on the owner's iPhone X over SSH,
 with no macOS login
password stored anywhere,
 and how the 7-day free-team profile auto-renews.
 This is written to be
reproducible from zero:
 a fresh Mac and a person who has never done this.
 Everyday use is the reusable
pattern;
 the full procedure rebuilds it from nothing.

The build is driven from a separate Linux host that reaches the Mac through the ssh alias `m1`.
 On an
all-Mac setup,
 run the lines marked "Linux host" directly on the Mac and drop the `ssh m1` wrapper.

## What this proves

Verified end to end on 2026-06-12:
 a signed build over SSH installs and launches on the iPhone X
(`iPhone10,3`,
 iOS 16.7.16,
 build 20H392),
 with the DeveloperDiskImage mounting and the app running.
Identity:
 `Apple Development: little.plan2433@fastmail.com`,
 team `HWLVAKDV4F`.
 These exact values are
this instance;
 a fresh Mac or Apple ID produces its own,
 and the procedure shows how to read each one.

## Current state

Status:
 DONE

Permanent artifacts on this instance,
 all surviving reboot:

- Mac,
   signing:
   `~/ios-vet/vet.keychain-db`,
   a dedicated keychain holding the Apple Development
  identity (certificate valid to 2027-06-12,
   plus its private key).
   It is the only signing secret on
  the Mac and is encrypted;
   its unlock password is not stored on the Mac.
- Linux host (this repo):
   the keychain's unlock password lives only in `.env.local` (git-ignored) as
  `XCODE_IDENTITY_SSH_USABLE`,
   a throwaway protecting the revocable signing key,
   never the login
  password.
- Mac,
   device support:
   `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/iOS DeviceSupport/16.7*` symlinked to Xcode's bundled
  16.4 `DeveloperDiskImage.dmg`,
   verified mounting on the 16.7.16 device.
- Mac,
   tools:
   `ios-deploy`,
   `libimobiledevice`,
   `ideviceinstaller`,
   `xcodegen` (Homebrew).
- Mac,
   profile:
   `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/Provisioning Profiles/*.mobileprovision` for app id
  `dev.monochromatic.iosvet.hellodevice`,
   scoped to the device.
   Free-team profiles last 7 days;
   see
  auto-renew below.
- Mac,
   auto-renew:
   `~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.monochromatic.iosvet.profilerenew.plist`.
- Mac,
   disk policy:
   the internal SSD is brittle and easily filled,
   so all heavy vet installs and builds
  go on the `MacData` volume (`/Volumes/MacData`);
   only files at or under about 1 MB stay on the internal
  disk.
   The signing keychain (`~/ios-vet/vet.keychain-db`,
   28 KB) and the `HelloDevice` renewal canary
  are the deliberate internal-disk residents (the keychain because it is the signing secret and small;
  HelloDevice because the daily renewal must not depend on MacData being mounted).
   The full layout,
   the
  symlink scheme,
   and the per-toolchain cache env vars are in
  `doc/handover/ios-framework-vet.md` under "Mac disk layout (MacData)".
- Device:
   Developer Mode on,
   this Mac trusted,
   the Apple Development certificate trusted
  (**Settings ▸ General ▸ Device Management**).
- Mac + device,
   trust anchor:
   a minimal SwiftUI app `dev.monochromatic.iosvet.anchor` ("Vet Anchor"),
  built from `~/ios-vet/Anchor` and signed by the same identity,
   stays installed on the device
  permanently and is never uninstalled.
   It exists so the certificate never has zero installed apps:
  uninstalling the last app from a free-team identity drops the device-wide developer trust and forces a
  manual re-approval.
   Distinct bundle id so churning the shared gate id never removes it.
   Project files in
  Appendix D;
   the mechanism and rules are in "Keep the developer trust" below.

## Build and run any vet app

Status:
 DONE

From the repo root on the Linux host.
 Reuse the bundle id `dev.monochromatic.iosvet.hellodevice` so the
existing profile and identity sign with no new provisioning.
 Set `UDID` to the value from
`idevice_id -l`:

```sh
UDID=9057e2a8c2e70162e35b9ea8bf006f736670877b
PW="$(grep -E '^(export[[:space:]]+)?XCODE_IDENTITY_SSH_USABLE=' .env.local \
  | head -1 | sed -E 's/^[^=]*=//; s/^["'\'']//; s/["'\'']$//' | tr -d '\r\n')"
printf '%s' "$PW" | ssh m1 "set -e
  PW=\$(cat)
  export DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
  KC=\$HOME/ios-vet/vet.keychain-db; LOGIN=\$HOME/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db
  security unlock-keychain -p \"\$PW\" \"\$KC\"
  security list-keychains -d user -s \"\$KC\" \"\$LOGIN\" >/dev/null
  cd <APP_DIR> && rm -rf build
  xcodebuild -project <APP>.xcodeproj -scheme <SCHEME> \
    -destination 'platform=iOS,id=$UDID' -configuration Debug -derivedDataPath build \
    OTHER_CODE_SIGN_FLAGS=\"--keychain \$KC\" build
  ios-deploy --id $UDID --bundle build/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/<APP>.app --justlaunch --no-wifi
  security list-keychains -d user -s \"\$LOGIN\" >/dev/null"
```

Each build reads the throwaway from `.env.local`,
 pipes it over the encrypted SSH channel (never a
command argument,
 never echoed),
 unlocks the vet keychain for that session,
 adds it to the codesign
search list so xcodebuild can resolve the identity (the `--keychain` flag alone satisfies only the
codesign step,
 not identity resolution),
 signs,
 installs and launches,
 then resets the search list to
login-only.
 The reset keeps the locked vet keychain out of the idle search list,
 which is what would
otherwise make the daily GUI renewal prompt for the throwaway.
 No GUI **Cmd+R**,
 no per-build owner
action.

Wired or wireless:
 the iPhone X is currently attached over wifi (paired for network),
 so it enumerates
under `idevice_id -n` (`(Network)`) but not under `idevice_id -l` (USB only).
 `xcodebuild` and
`ios-deploy` use wifi by default;
 `ios-deploy --no-wifi` and the `UDID=$(idevice_id -l)` line above both
assume a USB cable,
 so drop `--no-wifi` and read the UDID from `idevice_id -n` when wireless.
 The
libimobiledevice tools need the `-n` flag explicitly.
 The verified wireless install-and-render chain this
session was `ideviceinstaller -n install <app>` (or `-n upgrade`),
 then `idevicedebug -n run <bundleid>`
held alive,
 then `idevicescreenshot -n` after the UI draws,
 then `idevicecrashreport -n` to scan for a
crash.
 `--justlaunch` only proves the process was created under lldb,
 not that it rendered.

## Keep the developer trust: the anchor app and gate churn

Status:
 DONE

Failure observed 2026-06-12:
 the vet apps all reuse one bundle id
(`dev.monochromatic.iosvet.hellodevice`),
 so swapping one for another means
`ideviceinstaller -n uninstall` then `install`.
 During that gap the certificate had zero installed apps,
which drops the device-wide developer trust.
 The reinstalled app then refused to launch with "Unable to
launch ... because it has an invalid code signature,
 inadequate entitlements or its profile has not been
explicitly trusted by the user,
" and the owner had to re-approve the developer once in
**Settings ▸ General ▸ VPN & Device Management**.
 The block clears for every app on the cert at once,
not per app.

Two defenses,
 used together:

- Permanent anchor app.
   `dev.monochromatic.iosvet.anchor` is a distinct bundle id signed by the same
  identity.
   Because it is never uninstalled,
   the certificate always has at least one installed app,
   so
  uninstalling or reinstalling any gate app under the shared id can no longer reach zero.
   Build it once
  with the reusable pattern above,
   pointing at `~/ios-vet/Anchor/Anchor.xcodeproj`,
   scheme `Anchor`;
   its
  first build mints a fresh 7-day profile for the new app id through `-allowProvisioningUpdates` (a free
  team allows about 10 app ids per 7 days,
   so this spends one).
   Verified:
   it installs,
   launches,
   and
  renders "Vet Anchor" on the device,
   signed by the same cert hash
  `1690CF17B3C5E9A6D0E553096863ACEE28136D68` as the gate apps (so trusting it trusts them).
- Swap gate apps in place.
   Prefer `ideviceinstaller -n upgrade <app>` over uninstall then install:
   it
  replaces the app without a zero-app window,
   so it never drops trust even on the shared id.

Honesty caveat:
 the anchor is verified to prevent the uninstall-induced drop.
 Its behavior across the
7-day profile expiry is untested (it cannot be checked without waiting out a cycle).
 The renewal agent
below refreshes the signing capability but does not reinstall device apps,
 so the anchor's on-device copy
still expires in 7 days like any free-team build;
 rebuild and reinstall it with the reusable pattern to
keep it launchable,
 and if trust ever drops anyway,
 re-approve once in Settings.
 This removes the
churn-induced blocks,
 not every possible block.

## Black-box UI automation on the device (WebDriverAgent)

Status:
 PARTIAL,
 not pursued further by owner decision.
 Every step up to the XCTest session is proven on the
iPhone X (provision,
 build,
 sign,
 install,
 launch);
 the final on-device drive is blocked by a host-toolchain
gap,
 not a missing image:
 the installed Xcode 26 cannot stand up an XCTest session against iOS 16.7 (it is four
major versions newer than the device),
 and Appium's WDA v13 dropped the iOS-16 launch path.
 This is uniform
across every framework.
 Full detail and evidence:
`../decisions/ios-iphone-x-vet-report/vet-ui-automation.md`.
 The simulator leg (next subsection) is unblocked
and complete.

WebDriverAgent (WDA) is the iOS black-box-automation primitive that both Appium and Maestro wrap.
 On the
simulator it builds without signing;
 on the device it must be signed like any app,
 then launched as an XCTest
runner.
 Build,
 sign,
 and install it with the same keychain mechanism as any vet app,
 plus a new provisioned
app id (minted headlessly by `-allowProvisioningUpdates`,
 the same autonomous path as the anchor app):

```sh
# WDA project ships inside the appium xcuitest driver
WDA=~/.appium/node_modules/appium-xcuitest-driver/node_modules/appium-webdriveragent
# (pipe PW, unlock vet keychain, add to search list as in "Build and run any vet app", then:)
xcodebuild -project "$WDA/WebDriverAgent.xcodeproj" -scheme WebDriverAgentRunner \
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' -configuration Debug -derivedDataPath <dd> \
  -allowProvisioningUpdates \
  PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER=dev.monochromatic.iosvet.wda DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=HWLVAKDV4F \
  CODE_SIGN_STYLE=Automatic OTHER_CODE_SIGN_FLAGS="--keychain $KC" build-for-testing
# (restore search list to login-only)
ideviceinstaller -n install <dd>/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/WebDriverAgentRunner-Runner.app
```

This ends `** TEST BUILD SUCCEEDED **` and installs `dev.monochromatic.iosvet.wda.xctrunner`,
 signed by the vet
identity.
 Launching the XCTest runner needs a tool that drives testmanagerd over usbmux,
 not `idevicedebug`
(which only runs plain apps).
 Two work and both see the wireless device:
 `go-ios` (Go,
`go install github.com/danielpaulus/go-ios@latest`) and `tidevice` (Python,
 `pip install tidevice`):

```sh
go-ios runwda --bundleid=dev.monochromatic.iosvet.wda.xctrunner \
  --testrunnerbundleid=dev.monochromatic.iosvet.wda.xctrunner \
  --xctestconfig=WebDriverAgentRunner.xctest --udid=$UDID
# or: python3 -m tidevice -u $UDID xctest -B dev.monochromatic.iosvet.wda.xctrunner
iproxy 8100:8100 -u $UDID            # forward WDA's port to the host
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8100/status # WDA serves once its XCTest session is up
```

The blocker (host toolchain,
 not pursued):
 on this iPhone X (16.7.16) the runner launches with the correct
identity and a real pid,
 then exits without binding 8100,
 because the installed Xcode 26 cannot stand up an
XCTest session against iOS 16.7 (`xcodebuild test-without-building` reports `build number "" incompatible with
DVTBuildVersion` and `Logic Testing Unavailable`).
 It is not a device-support image:
 16.4 is the last
per-version DeveloperDiskImage Apple ships (both Xcode 26 and Xcode 15.2 carry support only to 16.4,
 reused for
all 16.
x),
 and that image is enough for plain app debug,
 which is why every render gate works.
 Closing it would
mean driving the device from an Xcode that natively supported iOS 16.7 (14.3.1 to 15.2):
 Xcode 15.2 was
downloaded and expanded,
 but using it needs its platform components installed via a sudo-plus-GUI first launch
(`iOS 17.2 is not installed`) and an iOS-16-compatible WebDriverAgent (the bundled v13 dropped iOS 16).
 The owner
judged that yak-shave not worth it.
 Wireless works for install and process-launch,
 but
`xcodebuild`/`xctrace`/`devicectl` only see the device over USB,
 so wire it for any xcodebuild-driven step.

### Simulator leg (unblocked, signing-free)

On a booted simulator WDA builds and launches with no signing.
 Drive any app with Appium (XCUITest driver) or
Maestro:

```sh
appium server -p 4723 --relaxed-security                    # first session builds WDA for the sim
xcrun simctl install <sim-udid> <app>.app                   # gate apps share one bundle id, so install per app
# Appium: POST /session {bundleId, forceAppLaunch:true}; GET /session/:id/source for the a11y tree
maestro --device <sim-udid> test flow.yaml                  # declarative; matches by visible label
```

The first Appium session triggers a one-time `xcodebuild` of WDA (do not set `usePrebuiltWDA` on that run).
 The
captured `/source` trees double as the headless half of the VoiceOver evidence.

## Auto-renew of the 7-day profile

Status:
 DONE

Facts:
 the signing certificate is valid one year;
 only the provisioning profile is 7 days (free
personal team).
 Regenerating the profile needs `xcodebuild -allowProvisioningUpdates`,
 which needs the
Apple ID session in the login keychain.
 The SSH session cannot reach the login keychain (locked for
key-auth SSH;
 `launchctl asuser` into the GUI session is `Operation not permitted` without sudo),
 but a
LaunchAgent runs inside the GUI login session where the login keychain is already unlocked,
 so it
renews with no password on disk.

`~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.monochromatic.iosvet.profilerenew.plist` (Appendix C) runs
`xcodebuild -allowProvisioningUpdates` daily and at load,
 logging to `~/ios-vet/renew.log`.
 Verified:
its first run exited 0 with `** BUILD SUCCEEDED **`.
 It is loaded with `launchctl bootstrap gui/<uid>`
and auto-loads at every login,
 so it survives reboot.
 It runs unattended:
 it signs with the login
keychain (whose key already authorizes codesign from the initial **Cmd+R**),
 and the build pattern
above leaves a login-only search list,
 so the locked vet keychain is not present to prompt for.

Behavior and limits:

- Xcode reuses a still-valid profile and only regenerates a fresh 7-day one near or past expiry
  (confirmed:
   a same-day run did not extend the window).
   The daily run catches that.
   Force a renewal:
  `ssh m1 'launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/dev.monochromatic.iosvet.profilerenew'` (verified
  exit 0).
- If a device build ever fails as expired,
   kickstart the agent and rebuild;
   no owner action.
- The one case that needs the owner:
   Apple periodically invalidates a free Apple ID session token
  (weeks to months).
   The renewal then logs a sign-in error;
   fix it once in Xcode
  **Settings ▸ Accounts** by re-entering the Apple ID password plus 2FA.
   A paid Apple Developer Program
  membership ($99/yr) removes the 7-day cycle entirely (1-year profiles).

## Full setup from scratch (fresh Mac, fresh person)

Status:
 DONE on this instance;
 this section reproduces it on a new machine or Apple ID.

Bring:
 a Mac on current macOS,
 the iPhone X and a USB cable,
 an Apple ID (free is enough) with access
to its two-factor codes,
 and the build-driver repo checked out (here on a Linux host reached as
`ssh m1`).
 Run on the Mac unless a step says "Linux host".
 For brevity each command assumes
`export DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer` is set in the shell.

### Why some steps are the owner's, not automatable

- Adding an Apple ID to Xcode is two-factor gated;
   the session token comes from an authenticated login
  that cannot be reproduced headlessly.
   The owner signs in.
- SSH-driven `codesign` cannot reach the login keychain (locked for key-auth SSH sessions),
   so a
  dedicated keychain the build driver fully controls is used instead of the login keychain.
- `launchctl asuser` into the GUI session for renewal is `Operation not permitted` without sudo,
   so a
  LaunchAgent loaded into the GUI session does the renewal.

### Steps

1.  Install full **Xcode** (not just Command Line Tools):
     from the **App Store** (search **Xcode**,
    click **Get**),
     or `xcodes install --latest`.
     Expected:
     `/Applications/Xcode.app` exists.
2.  Select it and accept the license:
    ```sh
    sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
    sudo xcodebuild -license accept
    ```
    Expected:
     `xcodebuild -version` prints `Xcode 26.x`.
3.  Install Homebrew if absent (`https://brew.sh`),
     then the device tools:
    ```sh
    brew install ios-deploy libimobiledevice ideviceinstaller xcodegen
    ```
    Expected:
     `which ios-deploy ideviceinfo xcodegen` all resolve.
4.  Plug the iPhone X into the Mac and unlock it.
     On the phone tap **Trust** on **Trust This Computer?
    **
    and enter the passcode.
     Expected:
     `idevice_id -l` prints a 40-char UDID and
    `ideviceinfo -k DeviceName` prints the device name with no pairing error.
5.  Enable Developer Mode:
     on the phone open **Settings ▸ Privacy & Security ▸ Developer Mode**,
     toggle
    it **on**,
     tap **Restart**,
     and after reboot confirm **Turn On** with the passcode.
     Expected:
    `ideviceinfo -q com.apple.security.mac.amfi -k DeveloperModeStatus` prints `true`.
6.  Capture device facts and symlink DeviceSupport to the newest bundled image (Xcode 26 ships up to
    16.4;
     the iPhone X is 16.7.
    x,
     and the 16.4 disk image mounts on it):
    ```sh
    VER=$(ideviceinfo -k ProductVersion); BUILD=$(ideviceinfo -k BuildVersion)
    DEV="/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport"
    NEAR=$(ls "$DEV" | sort -V | tail -1)
    mkdir -p "$HOME/Library/Developer/Xcode/iOS DeviceSupport"
    ln -sfn "$DEV/$NEAR" "$HOME/Library/Developer/Xcode/iOS DeviceSupport/$VER ($BUILD)"
    ```
    Expected:
     the symlink lists under that directory.
7.  Generate the HelloDevice signing-test project from the files in Appendix A:
    ```sh
    mkdir -p ~/ios-vet/HelloDevice/Sources && cd ~/ios-vet/HelloDevice
    # write project.yml, Sources/App.swift, Sources/ContentView.swift from Appendix A
    xcodegen generate
    xcodebuild -project HelloDevice.xcodeproj -scheme HelloDevice -sdk iphonesimulator \
      -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' build
    ```
    Expected:
     the simulator build ends `** BUILD SUCCEEDED **` (no signing needed yet).
8.  Sign in the Apple ID:
     open **Xcode ▸ Settings (Cmd+,
    ) ▸ Accounts**,
     click **+**,
     choose
    **Apple ID**,
     enter email and password,
     then the **six-digit code**.
     Expected:
     the account appears
    with a team row (a free account shows `(Personal Team)`).
9.  First signed run and trust:
     open `~/ios-vet/HelloDevice/HelloDevice.xcodeproj`,
     select the
    **HelloDevice** target ▸ **Signing & Capabilities**,
     tick **Automatically manage signing**,
     pick
    your **Team**,
     choose the **iPhone X** destination,
     press **Run (Cmd+R)**.
     On the phone's
    **Untrusted Developer** block,
     open **Settings ▸ General ▸ VPN & Device Management** (labeled
    **Device Management** on some builds),
     tap your Apple ID under **Developer App**,
     tap **Trust**.
    Expected:
     the app launches showing `iOS vet signing OK`;
     `security find-identity -v -p codesigning`
    lists `Apple Development: <you>`.
10. Export the identity for headless signing,
     in a local Mac terminal:
    ```sh
    mkdir -p ~/ios-vet
    printf 'pick a throwaway .p12 password: '; stty -echo; read -r P; stty echo; echo
    security export -k "$HOME/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db" -t identities -f pkcs12 \
      -P "$P" -o "$HOME/ios-vet/vet-identity.p12"
    unset P
    ```
    Approve any keychain dialog.
     Then on the Linux host add the SAME password to the repo `.env.local`
    (git-ignored):
     a line `XCODE_IDENTITY_SSH_USABLE=<that password>`.
     Expected:
    `~/ios-vet/vet-identity.p12` exists and `.env.local` has the key.
11. Build the self-managed vet keychain.
     From the Linux host (pipes the password so it is never
    echoed):
    ```sh
    PW="$(grep -E '^(export[[:space:]]+)?XCODE_IDENTITY_SSH_USABLE=' .env.local | head -1 \
      | sed -E 's/^[^=]*=//; s/^["'\'']//; s/["'\'']$//' | tr -d '\r\n')"
    printf '%s' "$PW" | ssh m1 'set -e; PW="$(cat)"; KC="$HOME/ios-vet/vet.keychain-db"
      rm -f "$KC"
      security create-keychain -p "$PW" "$KC"
      security set-keychain-settings "$KC"
      security unlock-keychain -p "$PW" "$KC"
      security import "$HOME/ios-vet/vet-identity.p12" -k "$KC" -P "$PW" \
        -T /usr/bin/codesign -T /usr/bin/security
      security set-key-partition-list -S apple-tool:,apple:,codesign: -s -k "$PW" "$KC" >/dev/null
      security find-identity -v -p codesigning "$KC"
      rm -f "$HOME/ios-vet/vet-identity.p12"'
    ```
    Expected:
     `1 valid identities found`.
     The `.p12` is deleted;
     the keychain (encrypted) is the only
    signing secret left on the Mac.
12. Install the renewal LaunchAgent from Appendix C at
    `~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.monochromatic.iosvet.profilerenew.plist` (edit the absolute
    `/Users/<you>` paths),
     then load it:
    ```sh
    plutil -lint ~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.monochromatic.iosvet.profilerenew.plist
    launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.monochromatic.iosvet.profilerenew.plist
    ```
    Expected:
     lint prints `OK`;
     after a minute `~/ios-vet/renew.log` ends `** BUILD SUCCEEDED **` and
    `launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/dev.monochromatic.iosvet.profilerenew` shows `last exit code = 0`.

From here,
 the reusable build pattern at the top signs any app for the device.

## What to check

Status:
 DONE

- `ssh m1 'security find-identity -v -p codesigning ~/ios-vet/vet.keychain-db'` prints
  `1 valid identities found` and `Apple Development: <you>`.
- `ssh m1 'ideviceinfo -q com.apple.security.mac.amfi -k DeveloperModeStatus'` prints `true`.
- The reusable build pattern ends in `** BUILD SUCCEEDED **`,
   `[100%] Installed package`,
  `Developer disk image mounted successfully`,
   `success`.
- `ssh m1 'launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/dev.monochromatic.iosvet.profilerenew'` shows
  `last exit code = 0`;
   `tail ~/ios-vet/renew.log` ends in `** BUILD SUCCEEDED **`.
- HelloDevice launches on the phone showing `iOS vet signing OK`.

## Restore

Status:
 DONE

- Remove the test app:
   `ssh m1 'ideviceinstaller -n uninstall dev.monochromatic.iosvet.hellodevice'`,
  or long-press the icon and remove.
   Removing the last app from this cert drops the device-wide
  developer trust (see "Keep the developer trust");
   the anchor app is the deliberate permanent resident,
  so a full teardown also removes it:
  `ssh m1 'ideviceinstaller -n uninstall dev.monochromatic.iosvet.anchor'`.
- Stop auto-renew:
   `ssh m1 'launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/dev.monochromatic.iosvet.profilerenew; rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.monochromatic.iosvet.profilerenew.plist'`.
- Tear down signing:
   `ssh m1 'rm ~/ios-vet/vet.keychain-db; security list-keychains -d user -s ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db'`;
   remove `XCODE_IDENTITY_SSH_USABLE` from `.env.local`;
   in
  Xcode **Settings ▸ Accounts** remove the Apple ID.
- DeviceSupport symlinks and Homebrew tools are harmless to keep;
   remove the symlinks with
  `rm ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/iOS\ DeviceSupport/16.7*`.
- `rm -rf ~/ios-vet` drops the keychain,
   test project,
   and logs.

## Appendix D: trust anchor project files

Identical to Appendix A apart from the name,
 bundle id,
 the explicit team,
 and the on-screen text.
 Write
these under `~/ios-vet/Anchor`,
 run `xcodegen generate`,
 then build with the reusable pattern (scheme
`Anchor`).
 `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` is set explicitly here because the spec carries no other team hint;
 use the
value from `security find-identity` or the existing profile (here `HWLVAKDV4F`).

`project.yml`:

```yaml
name: Anchor
options:
  deploymentTarget:
    iOS: "16.0"
targets:
  Anchor:
    type: application
    platform: iOS
    sources: [Sources]
    settings:
      base:
        PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER: dev.monochromatic.iosvet.anchor
        DEVELOPMENT_TEAM: HWLVAKDV4F
        GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE: YES
        INFOPLIST_KEY_UILaunchScreen_Generation: YES
        MARKETING_VERSION: "1.0"
        CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION: "1"
        TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY: "1"
        CODE_SIGN_STYLE: Automatic
        SWIFT_VERSION: "5.0"
```

`Sources/App.swift`:

```swift
import SwiftUI

@main
struct AnchorApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup { ContentView() }
    }
}
```

`Sources/ContentView.swift`:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: 16) {
            Text("Vet Anchor").font(.largeTitle)
            Text("Keeps dev cert trusted. Do not delete.")
        }.padding()
    }
}
```
