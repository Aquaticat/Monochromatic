# Issue #486: do oxlint and tsc handle workspace `/ts` source imports?

Grilling session record,
 started 2026-09-06.
Proposal state only;
no decision is ratified until the user accepts one.
The decision,
 once made,
 lands in `doc/decision/workspace-ts-source-imports.md` and rewrites rule ST3 in `AGENTS.md`.

## The convention under question

Rule ST3 in `AGENTS.md`:
cross-package workspace imports use the package's `/ts` subpath,
which resolves to TypeScript source,
never built output.
The convention entered `AGENTS.md` in commit `e5bc11cbc` (2026-07-13).
Its rationale is recorded in `.out-of-scope/typescript-project-references.md` (issue #123,
 closed 2026-05-14):
tsgo reads sibling source through `./ts` exports,
so cross-package type checks stay fast without emitted declarations.

## Trigger (user, round 2)

The performance of the project-owned oxlint rule package `oxlint-plugin/prefer-readonly-parameter-type`.
The user's framing:
the performance case for `/ts` was made when the repo was smaller,
and it has since been seen to hurt.

## Measurements (2026-09-06, this machine)

- Package count at issue #123's close (2026-05-14): 95.
  Today: 151.
- Per-package `tsc --listFiles` over 148 packages with a `tsconfig.json`:
  median 95 sibling workspace source files per program;
  39 packages hold more than 100;
  122 hold more sibling files than their own.
  Largest:
   `config/oxlint` (394 sibling,
   14 own),
  `dev-script/vm-builder` (203 sibling,
   5 own),
  `mcp/mvm` (176 sibling,
   11 own).
- `mise run //package/dev-script/task-util:lint:types`:
   0.46 s wall for a 126-file program (31 own).
- `mise run //package/dev-script/task-util:lint:oxlint`:
   3 errors,
  all `typescript(no-useless-empty-export)`,
  unrelated to `/ts`.
- Cross-package `/ts` import sites: 1789.
  Packages exporting `./ts/*`: 61.
  Package tsconfigs declaring `references`: 0.
  Packages extending the non-dom base config: 8.

- Whole-repo warm `mise run lint:oxlint` (2026-09-06,
   single run,
   one oxlint invocation):
  114.4 s in oxlint over 3075 files,
  115.6 s wall,
  19477 warnings and 1340 errors.
  Run-to-run band recorded earlier for this sweep:
   about 4.6 s.
- Warm single-package `lint:oxlint`:
  `mcp/mvm` 1.1 s (11 files,
   176 sibling sources in its program);
  `pi-plugin/auto-mode` 4.8 s (66 files,
   148 sibling sources).
  Both under the 10 s package target;
  the cost that exceeds target is the sweep.
- Persistent rule cache `node_modules/.cache/prefer-readonly-parameter-type`:
   72 MB.

- Rule liveness (positive control,
   2026-09-06):
  the warm sweep output holds 23 `prefer-readonly-parameter-type(prefer-readonly-parameter-types)` findings,
  so the rule runs repo-wide and the repo is close to remediated.
  `file-enforcer` and `mcp/mvm` report none.
- `file-enforcer` warm `lint:oxlint` with the readonly rule allowed via `--allow`:
   1.3 s,
  against 1.4 s with it on;
  warm per-package cost of the rule is inside the noise here.

- Warm sweep with the readonly rule allowed (`--allow prefer-readonly-parameter-type/prefer-readonly-parameter-types`,
  wrapper run from the root the way the task runs it):
   65.3 s over the same 3075 files,
  against 114.4 s with the rule on.
  Confound:
  the `config-oxlint` bundle was rebuilt between the two runs and `stylistic(require-asterisk-prefix)` fell from
  15520 to 322 warnings,
  so a control run of the same wrapper command without `--allow` is being taken before the 49 s is attributed.

- Control sweep (same wrapper command,
   rule on,
   after the config rebuild):
   154.2 s on 3080 files,
  4273 warnings and 1327 errors.
  Both this and the 65.3 s rule-allowed run happened while the worktree spike was installing and building on
  the same machine,
  so the rule's share sits somewhere between 49 s and 89 s of the warm sweep until a back-to-back pair is
  measured on a quiet machine.

- Back-to-back warm sweep pair on a quiet machine (wrapper from the root,
   16 threads,
   3086 files):
  rule on 63.6 s and 63.4 s;
  rule allowed 64.8 s and 65.6 s;
  identical 4273 warnings and 1327 errors in all four.
  The rule's warm share of the sweep is inside the noise,
  and the earlier 114.4 s and 154.2 s runs were inflated by the research and spike agents running alongside.
  The warm sweep sits at the 60 s target within the recorded 4.6 s band.

## Evidence already in the repo

- `doc/planning/oxlint-warm-sweep-attribution.md` (issue #374,
   target:
   warm whole-repo `lint:oxlint` under 60 s):
  warm sweep 184 s,
  171 s of it inside `prefer-readonly-parameter-types`;
  cold 645 s;
  per-file `Program` visitor 82.8 ms warm across 2080 visits;
  85 percent of the rule's warm time sits inside `Program` outside every instrumented span
  (opening the semantic file session and verifying each callable).
  The document does not attribute that time to sibling source size;
  that attribution is a hypothesis,
   not a measurement.
- `doc/troubleshooting/oxlint-prefer-readonly-incremental-cache.md`:
  the rule's semantic project held 834 source files for a 13-file lint target;
  the effect-summary index retains every non-declaration workspace source in the project,
  so the rule's workload is bounded by the transitive `/ts` closure,
  not by oxlint's target count.
- `package/oxlint-plugin/prefer-readonly-parameter-type/README.md`:
  "Workspace calls resolve through repository source and are analyzed live";
  locked package calls resolve through package exports to shipped implementation on demand.
- `doc/troubleshooting/typescript.md`:
  a consumer's tsconfig type-checks sibling source under the consumer's `lib`,
  which forced every package onto the `/dom` config.
- `doc/troubleshooting/rolldown-plugin-dts-typescript-7-generator.md`:
  bundling sibling `/ts` source broke declaration generation under TypeScript 7;
  worked around with rolldown-plugin-dts 0.27.4 plus explicit Oxc.
- `package/oxlint-plugin/test-import/README.md`:
  oxlint's native import restriction cannot tell own `/ts` from sibling `/ts`,
  hence the custom rule.
- `doc/decision/npm-publishing.md`:
  `./ts` is stripped at publish.

## Precedent (research, 2026-09-06)

`doc/research/typescript-monorepo-cross-package-imports.md` surveys Vue core,
Vite,
Vitest,
typescript-eslint,
Effect,
Babel,
Sentry,
Nx,
Turborepo,
and JSR at pinned commits.
Patterns found:

- Single root program with `paths` to source (Vue core,
   Vitest):
   sibling source checked once;
   lint not type-aware.
- Custom source condition plus compiled default (Vitest,
   Babel,
   Nx):
   editors,
   bundlers,
   and tests opt into source;
  checking is one root program or references.
- Source exports in-repo,
   compiled on publish (Effect):
   checking by references.
- Per-package programs over sibling declarations (typescript-eslint,
   Effect,
   Babel,
   Sentry,
   Nx):
  type-aware lint reads declarations;
  Sentry runs oxlint `--type-aware` per package after `^build:types`.
- Compiled-only with build ordering (Vite `plugin-legacy`,
   Sentry runtime).
- Per-package programs over source:
   only Vite's intra-package overlap and this repo's `/ts` subpath;
  no surveyed project documents choosing it for cross-package imports.

Every surveyed repo with type-aware lint (Sentry,
 typescript-eslint,
 Babel) has that lint read sibling declarations
and orders lint after a declaration build.

## Rejected

- TypeScript project references plus `emitDeclarationOnly`.
  Rejected by the user again on 2026-09-06 without investigation;
  recorded in `.out-of-scope/typescript-project-references.md`.

## Answers so far

- Trigger:
   prefer-readonly performance (round 2).
- Isolation costs (sibling source checked under the consumer's config,
   sibling errors in every consumer):
   not decided yet.
- Deliverable:
   decision doc,
   ST3 rewrite,
   and a real body on #486.
- New `AGENTS.md` rule to check `.out-of-scope/` and `doc/decision/` before proposing a direction:
  not added yet;
  tracked as issue #487.

## Round 3 answers

- Lever:
  the user asked how other large TypeScript monorepos handle cross-package imports before choosing;
  research delegated to a background agent on 2026-09-06.
- Acceptance target:
  both;
  warm whole-repo `lint:oxlint` under 60 s (issue #374) and a single-package `lint:oxlint` under 10 s warm.

- Issue disposition (round 3):
  edit #486 in place once the decision doc lands.

- Lever (round 4):
  measure first.
  Swap one package's sibling `/ts` imports for built declarations and dist in a throwaway worktree,
  run the rule warm twice both ways,
  and compare before choosing between the compiled boundary and a rule-only boundary.
- Coverage trade (round 4):
  once sibling calls are not analysed live through source,
  the rule infers their effects from the sibling's built dist,
  not by treating them as opaque.

- Performance premise (round 5):
  the user chose to extend the measurement before ruling on the `/ts` performance case:
  two more large-closure packages,
  and a cold whole-repo sweep with the rule on versus allowed.
- Isolation costs (round 5):
  accept and record;
  the `/dom`-everywhere convention stays the remedy,
  and sibling type errors keep surfacing in consumers.

## Open questions

- Which lever:
   change the import convention,
  change only the rule's boundary for sibling packages,
  or measure first by swapping one package's sibling `/ts` imports for built declarations and comparing rule time.
- Acceptance target:
   adopt issue #374's 60 s warm sweep,
   a per-package latency target,
   or both.
- Coverage trade if sibling calls stop being analyzed live through source:
  infer from the sibling's built dist (build before lint) or treat them as opaque.

## Measurement design (round 4, in progress)

Subject:
 `package/dev-script/file-enforcer` (138 own files,
151 sibling source files in its program;
main-worktree warm `lint:oxlint` 1.4 s on 136 files with 84 pre-existing `test-import` errors).
Throwaway worktree at `~/temp/agent/ts-boundary-spike-2026-09-06`.
Variant A keeps the `/ts` specifiers.
Variant B rewrites the five buildable sibling specifiers
(`module-test`,
 `module-logger`,
 `module-toml-edit`,
 `module-caught-value`,
 `module-matrix`)
to bare package names,
so tsc and the rule read the bundled `dist/final/*/index.d.mts` declarations and the dist runtime;
the bundled declarations were checked to import no sibling package.
Per variant:
 one populate run (cold,
 cache deleted first),
then three warm runs at `OXLINT_THREADS=1`,
`tsc --listFiles` composition,
three `lint:types` timings,
and finding counts by rule.
Known confound:
variant B also stops live analysis of sibling callables,
so its saving is an upper bound on the program-size effect alone.

## Spike result (2026-09-06, worktree `~/temp/agent/ts-boundary-spike-2026-09-06` at `30713b5ba`)

- Install needed `pnpm install --trust-lockfile`;
  plain and `--prefer-offline` installs failed in supply-chain verification with
  `ERR_PNPM_META_FETCH_FAIL` fetching `@jsr/std__internal` metadata from `registry.npmjs.org` (404).
- Positive control:
  with a known-invalid fixture copied into `file-enforcer/src`,
  the rule reported 13 `prefer-readonly` lines cold and warm,
  so the rule was live in the worktree.
  Without the fixture `file-enforcer` reports none in either variant;
  the rule is off for test files (`package/config/oxlint/src/overrides.ts:192`).
- Variant A (`/ts` source),
   `OXLINT_THREADS=1`:
  cold 8.1,
   7.9,
   8.1 s;
  warm 1.3,
   1.4,
   1.4 s;
  program holds 151 sibling source files;
  rule cache after a cold run 2,519,172 bytes in 122 files.
- Variant B (five siblings through built `index.d.mts` plus dist,
   73 files rewritten):
  cold 5.2,
   5.1,
   5.2 s;
  warm 1.4,
   1.4,
   1.3 s;
  program holds 11 sibling files (5 declarations,
   6 source from the types-only marker and `config/rolldown`);
  rule cache after a cold run 1,417,755 bytes in 89 files.
- `lint:types`:
   0.9 s in both variants,
  with or without a prior buildinfo.
- Findings:
   byte-identical between variants (217 warnings,
   101 errors,
   none from the readonly rules).
- Reading:
  the `/ts` closure changes only the cold path,
  by 2.9 s of 8.1 s for this package (spread 0.2 s and 0.1 s);
  warm cost is unchanged.
  Because variant B also stops live analysis of sibling callables,
  2.9 s is an upper bound on the program-size effect.

## Spike 2 result (2026-09-06, worktree `~/temp/agent/ts-boundary-spike-2-2026-09-06` at `c1abe05d3`, removed after)

- Retraction:
  `--allow prefer-readonly-parameter-type/prefer-readonly-parameter-types` (and `--allow=`,
   `-A`,
   rule-name-only)
  does not disable this JS plugin rule.
  A fixture probe kept its 11 findings under every spelling,
  and a cold sweep under `--allow` still wrote the rule cache and reported 22 findings.
  Every rule-allowed timing recorded earlier in this document
  (file-enforcer 1.3 s,
   sweeps 65.3 s,
   the quiet-machine pair) measured the rule on and is void.
  Setting the rule to `off` in the root `oxlint.config.ts` does disable it (484 rules,
   0 findings).
- Cold whole-repo sweeps in the worktree (16 threads,
   3086 files):
  rule on 261.4 s and 305.4 s (the first overlapped another session's package lint);
  rule off by config 14.8 s and 13.2 s;
  warm reference with the rule on 105.3 s.
  The rule is roughly 95 percent of a cold sweep and most of a warm one;
  the August attribution still holds.
- `pi-plugin/auto-mode` (`OXLINT_THREADS=1`,
   66 files,
   333 warnings and 38 errors every run):
  cold `/ts` 21.96 s median (spread 1.43) against built 5.43 s (spread 0.72);
  warm 3.06 s against 3.16 s;
  program sibling sources 147 against 6 plus 8 declarations;
  finding sets identical;
  positive control 11 rule findings with the fixture.
- `mcp/mvm` (11 files,
   zero findings):
  cold 7.43 s against 7.36 s;
  warm 1.21 s against 1.14 s;
  sibling sources 175 against 5 plus 5 declarations;
  no difference in either direction beyond spread.
- Reading:
  warm cost never moves with the closure.
  Cold cost moves only where the subject reaches many sibling callables
  (auto-mode 4 times faster,
   file-enforcer a third faster,
   mvm unchanged),
  which matches live analysis of reached sibling source rather than program size.

- Mechanism:
  `package/oxlint-plugin/prefer-readonly-parameter-type/src/prefer-readonly-parameter-types/effect-summary-persistent-cache.ts:79-84`
  documents that `projectKey` carries the configured project path,
  and lines 140 to 160 place each entry under `<digest(projectKey)>/<digest(fileName)>`.
  A sibling source file is therefore summarized once per consuming project,
  so a cold sweep pays the sum of every package's `/ts` closure (median 95 sibling files,
   148 packages),
  not the 3086 files once.
  That is a rule design choice,
  not a property of `/ts`.

## Next action

Run the extended measurement (two more packages,
cold sweep rule on versus allowed) after the warm sweep pair finishes,
record the numbers here,
then put the performance premise to the user again in round 6.
