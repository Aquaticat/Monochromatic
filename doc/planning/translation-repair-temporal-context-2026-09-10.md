# Temporal and participant source context

## Scope

Task 19 is in progress.
The verified production code is `134a2e20c`.
The bounded forward-heading window is implemented;
its existing repair-path output verification failed the wording goal and is being diagnosed.
No full-entry pass is active.
Task 20's non-persisted audit accuracy is deferred,
not a prerequisite to this work or the next Mio page reading.

## Actual evidence

The pinned Chinese source's preamble paragraph ends with `还曾：`.
The next heading introduces the primary-school friend story,
and the paragraph following that heading dates the reconnection to April 2022.
It identifies Bei Yan Yun Yi as the person who came out to Mio.
The source does not place this disclosure in childhood or state reciprocal disclosure during that reconnection.

Mio12's accepted repair wording instead says:

> She came out to her best friend in primary school.

The current `neighbouringSource` call for prepared slice position four includes
source slice three's childhood/SRS prose and slice five's heading,
but not slice six's dated paragraph.
This was reproduced in `~/temp/agent/Mio12-temporal-context-20260910.out`.
The implementation in `package/module/translation-repair/src/fidelity-window.ts`
budgets physical adjacent slices,
although its historical comments discuss neighboring sections.

The actual old translation slate does not contain a corrected date-and-participant alternative.
Its selected candidate drops the list entirely;
other candidates repeat the ambiguous or reversed bullet.
The lane contest selects repair to preserve the archive's list.
Evidence:

- `~/temp/agent/Mio12-temporal-lane-20260910.out`
- `~/temp/agent/Mio12-temporal-contest-20260910.out`

This is a missing-input hypothesis,
not evidence that a stronger rejection gate or an additional corrective generation round is needed.

The caller trace is in `~/temp/agent/temporal-window-callers-20260910.out`.
`repair-slice-settle.ts` includes both neighboring texts in its cache key
and `repair-chunk.ts` threads one shared window through critics,
judges and editors.
`translate-stage-repair.ts` passes neighboring evidence to judging,
but its initial `produceTranslateSlate` call does not pass either neighbor field.
Therefore a window change alone must not be described as improving initial translation-writer inputs.
If the measurements support wider evidence,
verify and measure the producer boundary as well as the selector boundary before choosing the complete remedy.

## Matched experiment

`~/temp/agent/probe-temporal-context-20260910.mjs`
rebuilds the exact Mio12 preparation from its stored artifact and pinned source.
It asserts that the intervening slice contains only headings
and that the next source paragraph begins with the April 2022 date.

The controlled main slate preserves the accepted prose,
normalizing the independently fixed group-name defect identically across all alternatives.
Only the first bullet varies:

- Archive wording with childhood attachment and Mio as discloser.
- `from primary school`,
  fixing the temporal attachment while retaining Mio as discloser.
- Reconnection with the primary-school friend,
  with that friend coming out to Mio.
- Reciprocal disclosure at reconnection,
  which the source does not state.

These are controlled alternatives,
not historical model outputs;
no model authorship is attributed to them.
The production shared candidate-selector builder and ordinary translation criteria are reused.
The fixed judges are the original responding judges from Mio12's translation selection for this slice.
These per-seat observations are not a production-window tally.

The direct-source positive control runs first.
It uses the actual dated Chinese paragraph and its archive translation,
changing only the disclosure sentence into matching date/direction alternatives.
If no judge chooses the source-correct control,
the harness stops before purchasing the main comparisons.
Null results must be interpreted against each judge's control response.

Main contrasts keep candidate texts,
original slice and system instructions identical:

- Current physical source and archive neighbors.
- Original neighboring source plus the next body paragraph,
  with neighboring archive held fixed.
- The same widened source plus the corresponding archive paragraph.

This separates the effect of source evidence from paired English context.
It does not yet choose a global traversal algorithm,
expand picture authority,
change the corpus,
or authorize translating every neighboring passage into the current slice.
All controlled candidate texts compile as MDX before the live run;
compiled provider code is never executed.

## Completed selector-input measurement

`proc_1eda` completed `translation-repair-temporal-context-probe-20260910` in 186 seconds.
Plan:
`~/temp/agent/temporal-context-plan-20260910.out`.
Log:
`~/temp/agent/temporal-context-probe-20260910.log`.
Report:
`~/temp/agent/temporal-context-probe-20260910/report.json`.

The probe is bounded to twenty-four requests,
six concurrent,
360000 ms per exchange and 1200000 ms globally.
Completion caps remain the client's measured defaults.
No provider SDK,
reasoning-budget field or extra production writing round is introduced.

All six judges select the date-and-direction-correct positive control.
With current physical neighbors,
only one chooses the correct main candidate;
others prefer childhood attachment,
Mio as discloser,
mutual disclosure,
or decline the slate.
Adding the next source paragraph moves four of six to the correct wording.
Adding the corresponding archive paragraph also yields four correct choices,
with a different abstaining judge.
The widened arms select no incorrect alternative;
the other replies abstain over shared list/coverage objections.

Some judges misread "not expected to render this" as prohibiting existing summaries supported by context.
The reported candidate texts,
not every rationale assertion,
are the evidence of correct choice.
These are matched per-seat results,
not a production selection or unanimity requirement.

The run logged 0.00062544 USD on Bedrock,
four OpenRouter calls reporting zero,
and four unpriced Hyper plus twelve unpriced Synthetic calls.
The daily helper ran afterward.

## Completed first-writer context probe

`proc_7375` completed `translation-repair-temporal-writer-context-probe-20260910` in 376 seconds.
Script:
`~/temp/agent/probe-temporal-writer-context-20260910.mjs`.
Plan:
`~/temp/agent/temporal-writer-context-plan-20260910.out`.
Log:
`~/temp/agent/temporal-writer-context-probe-20260910.log`.
Report:
`~/temp/agent/temporal-writer-context-probe-20260910/report.json`.

It captures actual first-writer requests from `produceTranslateSlate` on frozen `ba01babda`,
including the existing answer-character bound and 360000 ms exchange bound.
The offline plan now asserts the actual `translation_report` schema name;
a mistaken schema-name assertion failed before any live call.

Qwen,
Kimi and Mercury each receive the current no-neighbor baseline,
physical neighbor context,
and context including the next body paragraph.
System instructions and current source/archive bytes stay fixed.
Both contextual arms use the same instruction that context clarifies references and already-carried details,
adds no neighboring-passage coverage obligation,
and cannot license unsupported facts.
Only context width differs between those arms.

The run permits nine calls,
three concurrently,
with a 1200000 ms global bound.
It buys no structural send-back or follow-up generation.
The writer treatment did not fix the observed bullet.
Qwen and Kimi both keep Mio as the discloser with the childhood attachment in the wider arm;
Mercury's wider reply fails schema validation.
Some baseline and physical-context drafts also omit the required list,
duplicate the administrator detail or change the established group name.
Those are not successful outputs merely because they compile.
No initial-translation-writer context change is integrated from this experiment.

The run logged three OpenRouter calls reporting zero cost
and six unpriced Synthetic calls.
The daily helper ran afterward.

## Implemented heading boundary

The fixed-slate source evidence supports a bounded context change for existing consumers.
The independent advisor recommended forward-only extension:
a heading governs the body after it,
whereas looking backward past a heading can pull in the prior section's body.
That correction to the proposed symmetric traversal was adopted.

`1bdf5d17c` adds failing guards.
The old implementation fails the dated-body,
media-body and unknown-node body cases.
`e086402a6` adds `fidelity-window-positions.ts`
and makes both language views use its shared positions.

The rule preserves immediate neighbors and adds at most one body slice
when the immediate following source slice is positively heading-only.
It does not traverse backward,
skip media,
walk past another heading,
or cross metadata.
Nonempty unknown-node content consumes the single body position;
empty content and mixed heading/body slices stop extension.
Stamped result indices remain distinct from array positions.

The initial full suite exposed an older fixture that cast incomplete objects to `ChunkPair`
without the required `nodes` fields.
`f8fd0555d` supplies parsed structural nodes instead of weakening the production type contract.
Formatting and early-return cleanup follow through `134a2e20c`.
The final build,
types,
zero-warning oxlint and full unit suite pass.
`~/temp/agent/heading-window-check-unit-20260910.out` ends `unit exit 0` at line 9065.

The frozen build is
`package/module/translation-repair/node_modules/.frozen-dist-134a2e20c`.
The actual reconstructed Mio12 window now byte-matches the measured widened source and archive contexts.
This is checked by the next probe's offline plan,
not inferred from the before-state code.

## Completed existing repair-path verification exposes an unresolved contract boundary

`proc_c166` completed `translation-repair-temporal-repair-path-probe-20260910` in 748 seconds.
Script:
`~/temp/agent/probe-temporal-repair-path-20260910.mjs`.
Plan:
`~/temp/agent/temporal-repair-path-plan-20260910.out`.
Log:
`~/temp/agent/temporal-repair-path-probe-20260910.log`.
Report:
`~/temp/agent/temporal-repair-path-probe-20260910/report.json`.

It runs the real `repairChunk` for the actual Mio12 slice,
using the stock role allocation under the original availability snapshot,
including critics,
panels,
editors,
selectors and checkers.
Those existing repair consumers already receive neighboring context.
The client retains normal routing,
completion caps,
quorum and author-defense policies.

The probe covers one slice,
at most 120 JSON requests,
360000 ms per exchange and 1200000 ms globally.
Reaching the request bound aborts the shared signal;
an incomplete run is not success evidence.
It reuses completed payloads only in a copied disposable cache.
No corpus edit or extra production generation round is introduced.

The process returned after forty-six requests and its text compiles,
but it did not produce a correct retained summary bullet.
It removed the entire list and changed `Harunome Hanbai` to source script plus `Harunome Studio`.
The paragraph ends with "and she also:".
This is not a successful wording repair or grounds for launching the full Mio pass.

The requests were six critics,
six panel calls,
three editors,
twenty-five candidate selections,
three resolution checks and three introduced-defect checks.
No precise temporal/participant claim survived in the returned issue set.
Two broad list-addition claims each drew four supporting votes,
one opposing vote and one ambiguous vote.
One wrongly describes even the administrator detail as absent,
although that detail is present in the current original.
All three editors remove the list.

The group-name claims also received authorization in the full packet,
with five supporting votes on several literal-name/gloss claims.
This responding panel differs from the earlier isolated group-name experiment;
do not attribute the difference to packet size or the heading-window change without a matched comparison.
Task 21 separately tracks full-repair name authority and blocks the next Mio pass.
No special glossary entry is authorized.

The run logged 0.00205745 USD on Bedrock,
three OpenRouter calls reporting zero,
and thirteen unpriced Hyper plus twenty-four unpriced Synthetic calls.
The daily helper ran afterward.

`~/temp/agent/replay-temporal-repair-path-20260910.mjs`
reproduces all forty-six completed calls with no provider client,
zero cache misses,
and identical repaired text.
Its captured exact requests and responses are in
`~/temp/agent/temporal-repair-path-replay-20260910.json`.
Summaries and decisions:

- `~/temp/agent/temporal-repair-path-summary-20260910.out`
- `~/temp/agent/temporal-repair-adjudication-20260910.out`
- `~/temp/agent/temporal-repair-editors-20260910.out`

## Next measured boundary

The critic's existing nearby-context rule permits only locating material carried across passages.
The panel's rule also concentrates on relocation.
A candidate's coverage obligations,
its editable target,
and the source evidence that can verify a current claim are different boundaries.
Treating "not required to translate" as "cannot support any current wording" defeats the supplied context.

The next hypothesis changes those existing context-purpose rules,
not the documents,
roster,
quorums,
response schema or production graph.
Nearby source may verify references,
time,
participants and details already asserted in the current target.
It adds no obligation to translate neighboring passages.
Nearby archive shows placement,
not factual authority.
Critic quotes remain anchored to the current documents;
when source evidence exists only nearby,
`sourceQuote` can be omitted while a current `targetQuote` anchors the claim.

The independent advisor supports this focused experiment and identifies a falsifier:
a compound claim may bundle a supported item with an unsupported one,
then continue authorizing deletion of the whole list.
Inspect propositions and actual tally outcomes,
not just whether one new temporal claim appears.
A fixed original panel packet tests the old claims only;
new critic claims need their own newly built panel packet before any end-to-end claim.
Task 19 remains in progress.
No new production prompt change has been made.
