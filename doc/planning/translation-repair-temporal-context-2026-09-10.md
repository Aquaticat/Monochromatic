# Temporal and participant source context

## Scope

Task 19 is in progress.
The verified production code is `8adb77fb9`.
The forward-heading window,
clustered panel packets,
source-evidence/cache handoffs and repair-selector comparison evidence are implemented.
Their compiled full repair-path verification is active.
No full-entry pass is active.
Task 20's non-persisted audit accuracy is deferred,
not a prerequisite to this work or the next Mio page reading.

## Actual evidence

The pinned Chinese source's preamble paragraph ends with `还曾：`.
The next heading introduces the primary-school friend story,
and the paragraph following that heading dates the reconnection to April 2022.
It identifies Bei Yan Yun Yi as the person who came out to Mio.
The source does not place this disclosure in childhood or state reciprocal disclosure during that reconnection.

Mio12's accepted repair wording instead says:

> She came out to her best friend in primary school.

The current `neighbouringSource` call for prepared slice position four includes
source slice three's childhood/SRS prose and slice five's heading,
but not slice six's dated paragraph.
This was reproduced in `~/temp/agent/Mio12-temporal-context-20260910.out`.
The implementation in `package/module/translation-repair/src/fidelity-window.ts`
budgets physical adjacent slices,
although its historical comments discuss neighboring sections.

The actual old translation slate does not contain a corrected date-and-participant alternative.
Its selected candidate drops the list entirely;
other candidates repeat the ambiguous or reversed bullet.
The lane contest selects repair to preserve the archive's list.
Evidence:

- `~/temp/agent/Mio12-temporal-lane-20260910.out`
- `~/temp/agent/Mio12-temporal-contest-20260910.out`

This is a missing-input hypothesis,
not evidence that a stronger rejection gate or an additional corrective generation round is needed.

The caller trace is in `~/temp/agent/temporal-window-callers-20260910.out`.
`repair-slice-settle.ts` includes both neighboring texts in its cache key
and `repair-chunk.ts` threads one shared window through critics,
judges and editors.
`translate-stage-repair.ts` passes neighboring evidence to judging,
but its initial `produceTranslateSlate` call does not pass either neighbor field.
Therefore a window change alone must not be described as improving initial translation-writer inputs.
If the measurements support wider evidence,
verify and measure the producer boundary as well as the selector boundary before choosing the complete remedy.

## Matched experiment

`~/temp/agent/probe-temporal-context-20260910.mjs`
rebuilds the exact Mio12 preparation from its stored artifact and pinned source.
It asserts that the intervening slice contains only headings
and that the next source paragraph begins with the April 2022 date.

The controlled main slate preserves the accepted prose,
normalizing the independently fixed group-name defect identically across all alternatives.
Only the first bullet varies:

- Archive wording with childhood attachment and Mio as discloser.
- `from primary school`,
  fixing the temporal attachment while retaining Mio as discloser.
- Reconnection with the primary-school friend,
  with that friend coming out to Mio.
- Reciprocal disclosure at reconnection,
  which the source does not state.

These are controlled alternatives,
not historical model outputs;
no model authorship is attributed to them.
The production shared candidate-selector builder and ordinary translation criteria are reused.
The fixed judges are the original responding judges from Mio12's translation selection for this slice.
These per-seat observations are not a production-window tally.

The direct-source positive control runs first.
It uses the actual dated Chinese paragraph and its archive translation,
changing only the disclosure sentence into matching date/direction alternatives.
If no judge chooses the source-correct control,
the harness stops before purchasing the main comparisons.
Null results must be interpreted against each judge's control response.

Main contrasts keep candidate texts,
original slice and system instructions identical:

- Current physical source and archive neighbors.
- Original neighboring source plus the next body paragraph,
  with neighboring archive held fixed.
- The same widened source plus the corresponding archive paragraph.

This separates the effect of source evidence from paired English context.
It does not yet choose a global traversal algorithm,
expand picture authority,
change the corpus,
or authorize translating every neighboring passage into the current slice.
All controlled candidate texts compile as MDX before the live run;
compiled provider code is never executed.

## Completed selector-input measurement

`proc_1eda` completed `translation-repair-temporal-context-probe-20260910` in 186 seconds.
Plan:
`~/temp/agent/temporal-context-plan-20260910.out`.
Log:
`~/temp/agent/temporal-context-probe-20260910.log`.
Report:
`~/temp/agent/temporal-context-probe-20260910/report.json`.

The probe is bounded to twenty-four requests,
six concurrent,
360000 ms per exchange and 1200000 ms globally.
Completion caps remain the client's measured defaults.
No provider SDK,
reasoning-budget field or extra production writing round is introduced.

All six judges select the date-and-direction-correct positive control.
With current physical neighbors,
only one chooses the correct main candidate;
others prefer childhood attachment,
Mio as discloser,
mutual disclosure,
or decline the slate.
Adding the next source paragraph moves four of six to the correct wording.
Adding the corresponding archive paragraph also yields four correct choices,
with a different abstaining judge.
The widened arms select no incorrect alternative;
the other replies abstain over shared list/coverage objections.

Some judges misread "not expected to render this" as prohibiting existing summaries supported by context.
The reported candidate texts,
not every rationale assertion,
are the evidence of correct choice.
These are matched per-seat results,
not a production selection or unanimity requirement.

The run logged 0.00062544 USD on Bedrock,
four OpenRouter calls reporting zero,
and four unpriced Hyper plus twelve unpriced Synthetic calls.
The daily helper ran afterward.

## Completed first-writer context probe

`proc_7375` completed `translation-repair-temporal-writer-context-probe-20260910` in 376 seconds.
Script:
`~/temp/agent/probe-temporal-writer-context-20260910.mjs`.
Plan:
`~/temp/agent/temporal-writer-context-plan-20260910.out`.
Log:
`~/temp/agent/temporal-writer-context-probe-20260910.log`.
Report:
`~/temp/agent/temporal-writer-context-probe-20260910/report.json`.

It captures actual first-writer requests from `produceTranslateSlate` on frozen `ba01babda`,
including the existing answer-character bound and 360000 ms exchange bound.
The offline plan now asserts the actual `translation_report` schema name;
a mistaken schema-name assertion failed before any live call.

Qwen,
Kimi and Mercury each receive the current no-neighbor baseline,
physical neighbor context,
and context including the next body paragraph.
System instructions and current source/archive bytes stay fixed.
Both contextual arms use the same instruction that context clarifies references and already-carried details,
adds no neighboring-passage coverage obligation,
and cannot license unsupported facts.
Only context width differs between those arms.

The run permits nine calls,
three concurrently,
with a 1200000 ms global bound.
It buys no structural send-back or follow-up generation.
The writer treatment did not fix the observed bullet.
Qwen and Kimi both keep Mio as the discloser with the childhood attachment in the wider arm;
Mercury's wider reply fails schema validation.
Some baseline and physical-context drafts also omit the required list,
duplicate the administrator detail or change the established group name.
Those are not successful outputs merely because they compile.
No initial-translation-writer context change is integrated from this experiment.

The run logged three OpenRouter calls reporting zero cost
and six unpriced Synthetic calls.
The daily helper ran afterward.

## Implemented heading boundary

The fixed-slate source evidence supports a bounded context change for existing consumers.
The independent advisor recommended forward-only extension:
a heading governs the body after it,
whereas looking backward past a heading can pull in the prior section's body.
That correction to the proposed symmetric traversal was adopted.

`1bdf5d17c` adds failing guards.
The old implementation fails the dated-body,
media-body and unknown-node body cases.
`e086402a6` adds `fidelity-window-positions.ts`
and makes both language views use its shared positions.

The rule preserves immediate neighbors and adds at most one body slice
when the immediate following source slice is positively heading-only.
It does not traverse backward,
skip media,
walk past another heading,
or cross metadata.
Nonempty unknown-node content consumes the single body position;
empty content and mixed heading/body slices stop extension.
Stamped result indices remain distinct from array positions.

The initial full suite exposed an older fixture that cast incomplete objects to `ChunkPair`
without the required `nodes` fields.
`f8fd0555d` supplies parsed structural nodes instead of weakening the production type contract.
Formatting and early-return cleanup follow through `134a2e20c`.
The final build,
types,
zero-warning oxlint and full unit suite pass.
`~/temp/agent/heading-window-check-unit-20260910.out` ends `unit exit 0` at line 9065.

The frozen build is
`package/module/translation-repair/node_modules/.frozen-dist-134a2e20c`.
The actual reconstructed Mio12 window now byte-matches the measured widened source and archive contexts.
This is checked by the next probe's offline plan,
not inferred from the before-state code.

## Completed existing repair-path verification exposes an unresolved contract boundary

`proc_c166` completed `translation-repair-temporal-repair-path-probe-20260910` in 748 seconds.
Script:
`~/temp/agent/probe-temporal-repair-path-20260910.mjs`.
Plan:
`~/temp/agent/temporal-repair-path-plan-20260910.out`.
Log:
`~/temp/agent/temporal-repair-path-probe-20260910.log`.
Report:
`~/temp/agent/temporal-repair-path-probe-20260910/report.json`.

It runs the real `repairChunk` for the actual Mio12 slice,
using the stock role allocation under the original availability snapshot,
including critics,
panels,
editors,
selectors and checkers.
Those existing repair consumers already receive neighboring context.
The client retains normal routing,
completion caps,
quorum and author-defense policies.

The probe covers one slice,
at most 120 JSON requests,
360000 ms per exchange and 1200000 ms globally.
Reaching the request bound aborts the shared signal;
an incomplete run is not success evidence.
It reuses completed payloads only in a copied disposable cache.
No corpus edit or extra production generation round is introduced.

The process returned after forty-six requests and its text compiles,
but it did not produce a correct retained summary bullet.
It removed the entire list and changed `Harunome Hanbai` to source script plus `Harunome Studio`.
The paragraph ends with "and she also:".
This is not a successful wording repair or grounds for launching the full Mio pass.

The requests were six critics,
six panel calls,
three editors,
twenty-five candidate selections,
three resolution checks and three introduced-defect checks.
No precise temporal/participant claim survived in the returned issue set.
Two broad list-addition claims each drew four supporting votes,
one opposing vote and one ambiguous vote.
One wrongly describes even the administrator detail as absent,
although that detail is present in the current original.
All three editors remove the list.

The group-name claims also received authorization in the full packet,
with five supporting votes on several literal-name/gloss claims.
This responding panel differs from the earlier isolated group-name experiment;
do not attribute the difference to packet size or the heading-window change without a matched comparison.
Task 21 separately tracks full-repair name authority and blocks the next Mio pass.
No special glossary entry is authorized.

The run logged 0.00205745 USD on Bedrock,
three OpenRouter calls reporting zero,
and thirteen unpriced Hyper plus twenty-four unpriced Synthetic calls.
The daily helper ran afterward.

`~/temp/agent/replay-temporal-repair-path-20260910.mjs`
reproduces all forty-six completed calls with no provider client,
zero cache misses,
and identical repaired text.
Its captured exact requests and responses are in
`~/temp/agent/temporal-repair-path-replay-20260910.json`.
Summaries and decisions:

- `~/temp/agent/temporal-repair-path-summary-20260910.out`
- `~/temp/agent/temporal-repair-adjudication-20260910.out`
- `~/temp/agent/temporal-repair-editors-20260910.out`

## Next measured boundary

The critic's existing nearby-context rule permits only locating material carried across passages.
The panel's rule also concentrates on relocation.
A candidate's coverage obligations,
its editable target,
and the source evidence that can verify a current claim are different boundaries.
Treating "not required to translate" as "cannot support any current wording" defeats the supplied context.

The next hypothesis changes those existing context-purpose rules,
not the documents,
roster,
quorums,
response schema or production graph.
Nearby source may verify references,
time,
participants and details already asserted in the current target.
It adds no obligation to translate neighboring passages.
Nearby archive shows placement,
not factual authority.
Critic quotes remain anchored to the current documents;
when source evidence exists only nearby,
`sourceQuote` can be omitted while a current `targetQuote` anchors the claim.

The independent advisor supports this focused experiment and identifies a falsifier:
a compound claim may bundle a supported item with an unsupported one,
then continue authorizing deletion of the whole list.
Inspect propositions and actual tally outcomes,
not just whether one new temporal claim appears.
A fixed original panel packet tests the old claims only;
new critic claims need their own newly built panel packet before any end-to-end claim.
Task 19 remains in progress.
No new production prompt change has been made.

## Completed evidence-scope experiment

`proc_12b5` completed `translation-repair-evidence-scope-probe-20260910` in 476 seconds.
Script:
`~/temp/agent/probe-repair-evidence-scope-20260910.mjs`.
Plan:
`~/temp/agent/repair-evidence-scope-plan-20260910.out`.
Log:
`~/temp/agent/repair-evidence-scope-probe-20260910.log`.
Report:
`~/temp/agent/repair-evidence-scope-probe-20260910/report.json`.

The offline plan reconstructs real critic claims,
clusters and panel outcomes from twelve cached calls,
with zero misses and messages equal to the captured full-repair requests.
It checks the actual exchange field is 360000 ms.

The live experiment first applies the context-role treatment to the unchanged original panel packet.
It then runs the real critic stage under the critic treatment,
including exact quote anchoring,
and builds a fresh panel packet from surviving new claims.
The real panel stage and `tallyVotes` determine authorization in both panel runs.

Only existing user-message context-purpose rules change.
System instructions,
name policy,
source and target text,
neighbor text,
response schemas and stock role allocation remain fixed.
The first fixed-packet panel uses the same prompt-dependent original cohort;
the newly derived packet may select a different stock window,
which must not be misreported as a matched per-seat comparison.

The cap is fifty-four live JSON requests,
with a 1200000 ms global bound and shared abort on request exhaustion.
No editor calls or new production stages are bought by this experiment.
The run made twenty live requests.
On the fixed old packet,
both blanket list-addition claims moved from accepted to `needs-human`,
each with three supporting and three opposing votes.
That removes their authorization but is not unanimous rejection.

The new critic stage produced thirty-two anchored claims.
Several correctly identify the friend as the discloser to Mio,
and one explicitly places the reconnection disclosure in 2022.
They omit `sourceQuote` and retain exact target anchors,
so the suspected anchoring obstacle does not discard them.

The freshly derived panel accepts those precise claims,
but also accepts new blanket list-removal claims with five supporting votes.
It also accepts claims against the second friendship bullet,
whose supporting source section is outside the bounded window.
Thus the advisor's compound-claim/scope falsifier remains live;
the treatment alone is not sufficient.
No production prompt change is integrated from this result.

The run logged 0.00237755 USD on Bedrock,
two OpenRouter calls reporting zero,
and eight unpriced Hyper plus six unpriced Synthetic calls.
The daily helper ran afterward.

## Completed claim-extent and source-evidence experiment

`proc_9549` completed `translation-repair-claim-extent-probe-20260910` in 576 seconds.
Script:
`~/temp/agent/probe-repair-claim-extent-20260910.mjs`.
Plan:
`~/temp/agent/repair-claim-extent-plan-20260910.out`.
Log:
`~/temp/agent/repair-claim-extent-probe-20260910.log`.
Report:
`~/temp/agent/repair-claim-extent-probe-20260910/report.json`.

It keeps the new thirty-two-claim packet fixed,
reproducing the derived-panel baseline from seven cached requests with zero misses.
The baseline includes the unreadable DeepSeek-flash reply and its recovery attempt;
it is not filtered to usable responses.
An offline assertion initially mishandled the additional recovery user message.
The transformation now targets only the one original context-bearing user message,
preserves recovery instructions,
and separately asserts that no baseline client exception was swallowed.
The corrected plan passes before live calls.

The experiment factors two changes:

- Full current-entry Chinese source as additional factual evidence only,
  without expanding current editable or coverage scope.
  This source is 1755 characters;
  the experiment asserts its unchanged hash and an 8000-character input bound.
  No global whole-document context policy is adopted.
- A generic claim-extent rule:
  an unsupported item cannot prove that every item in its list or span is unsupported;
  narrow actual errors remain independently judgeable.

It measures each change alone and the combination,
with the completed scoped-window baseline retained as the comparator.
Name policy,
claim identities,
stock panel roster,
schemas,
nearby archive and actual tally rules stay unchanged.
The limit is fifty-four live requests,
360000 ms per exchange and 1200000 ms globally.
No critics,
editors or new production stages are added in this experiment.

The run made twenty-one live calls.
Claim extent alone still authorizes blanket removal.
Document evidence alone changes one blanket claim to `needs-human`,
but leaves false claims against the supported second-friendship bullet authorized.
The combined treatment again authorizes blanket removal.
The true participant correction remains accepted in all arms.
These results do not justify integrating either treatment as the remedy.

Per-claim participation differs from reported heard-panelist counts in two arms:
one reply uses severity words as votes,
and another omits verdicts for later claims.
The real resolver records `unknown-vote` and `missing-verdict` findings;
do not count these as valid support or opposition.
The combined arm has no such findings but still fails the intended authorization result.

The run logged 0.00470453 USD on Bedrock,
three OpenRouter calls reporting zero,
and ten unpriced Hyper plus two unpriced Synthetic calls.
The daily helper ran afterward.

## Completed editor responsibility experiment

Further voting-only prompt trials are not scheduled now.
The independent advisor recommends testing the existing editor's responsibility boundary
against actual assembled candidates.

`proc_b599` completed `translation-repair-editor-responsibility-probe-20260910` in 388 seconds.
Script:
`~/temp/agent/probe-editor-responsibility-20260910.mjs`.
Plan:
`~/temp/agent/editor-responsibility-plan-20260910.out`.
Log:
`~/temp/agent/editor-responsibility-probe-20260910.log`.
Report:
`~/temp/agent/editor-responsibility-probe-20260910/report.json`.

Both arms use the same newly derived accepted-issue packet,
including the true participant correction and false blanket claims.
This is not a comparison against old editor outputs that received different issues.
The production deduplication and envelope builders yield sixteen accepted issues and four edit regions.
The editor models are the unchanged stock trio.

The treatment replaces "reviewers confirmed" with a responsibility to verify fallible findings,
and rewrites the conflicting source-support rule rather than appending another exception.
The current source slice defines coverage;
the complete hash-checked original document supplies factual evidence;
only the current English edit regions may change.
It permits correcting an already-asserted fact's actor,
direction,
time or relationship without importing neighboring events or copying neighboring passages.
Name policy is unchanged and remains task 21.

The probe makes six calls maximum,
three concurrently,
with the existing response schema,
360000 ms exchange bound and 1200000 ms global bound.
It calls no panel or selector.
Every raw edit is resolved and applied through production `buildEditorCandidates`,
including the existing preservation gate.
It records complete assembled candidates,
rejected operations,
MDX compilation and the existing structure validator's result.
The validator is observed,
not added as a new publication gate.

The offline positive control applies a localized participant correction through the same assembler,
preserves all bytes outside its region,
and passes the existing structure check.
All three baseline editors remove the list and change the established group name.
All three treatment editors do the same;
one moves the administrator detail into the preceding region and deletes the list region entirely.
Every assembled candidate compiles,
but every candidate fails the existing archive block-shape check.
No candidate supplies the intended retained participant correction.
This falsifies the tested editor-responsibility treatment on this packet;
it is not integrated.

The run logged four unpriced Hyper and two unpriced Synthetic calls.
The per-provider spend and daily helpers ran afterward.
No reported dollar amount is treated as proof that unpriced service was free.

A further caller trace found that `editor-ensemble.ts` supplies no neighboring-source evidence
to either `selectPerEnvelope` or `selectChunkPatch`.
Per-envelope selection sees the current English region and a bounded English surroundings view;
whole-chunk selection sees only the current original as evidence.
Thus a successful new editor candidate will still require verification at those selection boundaries.
Do not claim the existing repair window already reaches every repair selector.

## Completed accurate-claim diagnostic control

`proc_ec6f` completed `translation-repair-editor-accurate-claim-probe-20260910` in 262 seconds.
Script:

Log:
`~/temp/agent/editor-accurate-claim-probe-20260910.log`.
Report:
`~/temp/agent/editor-accurate-claim-probe-20260910/report.json`.

This is a diagnostic positive control,
not a proposal to silently filter production claims.
The stock editor receives only the source-verified participant claim,
while the current source,
translation,
neighboring context,
stock editor models,
four edit regions and original preservation licenses remain unchanged.
Keeping the original licenses prevents a stricter gate from creating an apparent improvement.
Only the visible issue packet changes.

Three calls are allowed,
with a 360000 ms exchange bound and 1200000 ms global bound.
The real assembler and existing structure validator process each response.
Compare raw operations and assembled candidates against the completed stock-editor arm,
not just whether the process exits successfully.
All three editors correct the disclosure direction and retain the list,
second friendship item,
administrator item and established `Harunome Hanbai` name.
Both GLM outputs explicitly place disclosure at reconnection.
DeepSeek's bullet says the friend came out to Mio without adding a childhood timing claim,
but its other prose also repeats the administrator detail.
All three assembled candidates pass the existing structure check.

The editors also change other still-editable regions despite those regions having no visible issue in this control.
Those changes do not make the complete candidates automatically publishable;
the diagnostic establishes that the editors can produce the intended list correction with a non-conflicting packet.
It does not justify a production gold-label filter or claim that every problem is solved.

The run logged two unpriced Hyper and one unpriced Synthetic call.
The spend and daily helpers ran afterward.
No production prompt or admission-rule change is made.

## Completed isolated-claim panel diagnostic

`proc_02d2` completed `translation-repair-panel-isolated-claims-probe-20260910` in 42 seconds.

Report:
`~/temp/agent/panel-isolated-claims-probe-20260910/report.json`.

The next control isolates the accurate participant claim and the false second-friendship addition claim,
using the same source,
translation,
full original evidence,
system instructions and context-purpose rule as the completed document-evidence-only panel arm.
The production builder renumbers each isolated packet;
this is a packet-content/size diagnostic,
not a claim that numeric position has been independently eliminated as a factor.

The offline plan found eight distinct panelists had actually been asked in that full-packet arm,
although only six were heard.
The control includes all eight rather than selecting favorable or usable responses.
Compare each model's matched verdict separately from newly usable responses.
The real resolver and tally retain the original nine-seat configured basis.

The limit is sixteen calls,
six concurrent,
360000 ms per exchange and 1200000 ms globally.
No per-claim production calls or admission filter is introduced.
The true participant claim is accepted with seven supporting votes and one abstention.
DeepSeek-flash returned `supported, severity: major` in the vote field;
the real resolver records that as an abstention,
not a supported vote.

The false second-friendship addition claim is rejected with six opposing and two supporting votes.
Among the original six responding panelists,
DeepSeek Pro and Mercury switch from supported in the full packet to unsupported in isolation.
Gemma-e2b and Gemma-26b remain supportive;
Kimi and Qwen remain opposed.
Thus the matched responding set changes from four-to-two support to four-to-two opposition,
independent of the newly usable MiniMax and DeepSeek-flash replies.

This supports packet-content/size interference;
it does not prove that renumbering or every other presentation factor is irrelevant.
The run logged 0.00161704 USD on Bedrock,
two OpenRouter calls reporting zero,
and six unpriced Hyper plus four unpriced Synthetic calls.
The daily helper ran afterward.

## Completed existing-cluster review diagnostic

`proc_2d45` completed `translation-repair-panel-clusters-probe-20260910` in 430 seconds.

Report:
`~/temp/agent/panel-clusters-probe-20260910/report.json`.

The original aggregation contains five clusters with three,
six,
three,
five and fifteen claims.
The last cluster contains the list's distinct participant,
friendship,
name and administrator claims;
clustering proposes possible merges and does not already prove they are one defect.

The experiment uses those existing clusters as separate review units,
retaining every claim and the within-cluster merge question.
It holds the original eight asked panelists,
full source evidence,
current source/target,
context-purpose rule,
system instructions,
schemas and configured nine-seat tally basis fixed.
The production builder,
resolver and tally run independently for each cluster.

Forty calls maximum,
six concurrent,
360000 ms per exchange and 1200000 ms globally.
No production batching change or additional generation round has been implemented.
The mixed list cluster no longer authorizes blanket list deletion:
the broadest claim ties four-to-four and the two-item removal claim is rejected three-to-five.
Both false claims against the second friendship bullet are rejected two-to-six.
The actual participant correction remains accepted seven-to-one.
Name-change claims and administrator-placement claims remain accepted;
this does not complete task 21 or establish a good final candidate.
The existing resolver records malformed vote/group replies rather than silently counting them.

The non-list clusters retain supported corrections and reject the spurious clinical/tense claims.
The run logged 0.00473602 USD on Bedrock,
five OpenRouter calls reporting zero,
and fifteen unpriced Hyper plus ten unpriced Synthetic calls.
The daily helper ran afterward.

Report:

This moves from the fixed eight-panelist diagnostic to actual prompt-dependent stock windows.
`gatherStageVoices` receives the final context-bearing messages before it selects seats from the nine-seat panel.
The resolver and tally run independently per existing cluster,
retaining each cluster's actual ballots and configured basis rather than reinterpreting a union of seats.
Completed cluster-probe payloads seed a copied disposable cache.

The resulting issues go through production deduplication,
envelope derivation,
the stock editor prompt and the existing patch/preservation gate.
No editor responsibility treatment is used.
The report retains raw editor operations,
complete assembled candidates,
compilation and the existing structure check.
It does not yet call the repair selectors that lack neighboring source.

The bound is eighty JSON requests,
360000 ms per exchange and 1200000 ms globally.
No production batching change has been made.
The actual windows made thirty panel calls followed by three editor calls.
The resulting packet has more narrowly scoped edit regions and preserves the second friendship item outside the edits.
One editor,
GLM-5.3,
produces the correct friend-to-Mio disclosure bullet and retains the second friendship bullet.
It moves the administrator fact into prose and changes the group name,
so it is not a complete publication-ready result.
GLM-flash removes the first bullet;
DeepSeek replaces it with another copy of the second friendship bullet.
All three pass the structural check,
which correctly does not establish semantic accuracy.

The run logged six unpriced Synthetic and two unpriced Hyper calls;
completed payloads supplied cached requests.
The spend and daily helpers ran afterward.
No production batching change is yet applied.

## Completed repair-selector evidence check

`proc_ae78` completed `translation-repair-selection-context-probe-20260910` in 273 seconds.
Script:
`~/temp/agent/probe-repair-selection-context-20260910.mjs`.
Plan:
`~/temp/agent/repair-selection-context-plan-20260910.out`.
Log:
`~/temp/agent/repair-selection-context-probe-20260910.log`.
Report:
`~/temp/agent/repair-selection-context-probe-20260910/report.json`.

It uses actual candidates from the completed cluster/editor run,
with their actual authorship and unchanged fallbacks.
The stock per-envelope selector judges only the affected disclosure region;
the stock whole-chunk selector separately judges the three assembled candidates.
No invented composite or new writing is introduced.

The contrast adds nearby and whole-document source evidence,
without changing system criteria,
candidate wording or available judge roster.
The interceptor preserves the original prompt-dependent windows for the paired comparison;
a later compiled change still needs production-window verification.
The offline plan exercises both selector APIs,
checks the exchange field,
and preserves any additional recovery user messages instead of mistaking them for the candidate sheet.

The cap is sixty-four requests,
360000 ms per exchange and 1200000 ms globally.
The baseline regional selector declines and keeps the incorrect current bullet.
With source evidence,
it selects the correct friend-to-Mio replacement at weight four over six ballots.
This is an actual selected regional operation,
not a fallback or a vote-count-only claim.

The whole-chunk baseline selects the deleting candidate.
Added source evidence moves the whole-chunk vote to a three-to-three tie,
which invokes the existing indecision fallback and still returns that deleting candidate.
Do not describe the whole-chunk treatment as a successful selection.
Several reasons still call the corrected first bullet newly added,
but the chunk selector has never been shown the existing English that already carries the item.

The run logged 0.00158577 USD on Bedrock,
0.00105248 USD on OpenRouter,
and six unpriced Hyper plus eight unpriced Synthetic calls.
The daily helper ran afterward.
The unresolved group-name mutation remains task 21.

## Completed existing-English comparison check

`proc_3b2b` completed `translation-repair-selection-baseline-probe-20260910` in 58 seconds.
Script:
`~/temp/agent/probe-repair-selection-baseline-20260910.mjs`.
Plan:
`~/temp/agent/repair-selection-baseline-plan-20260910.out`.
Log:
`~/temp/agent/repair-selection-baseline-probe-20260910.log`.
Report:
`~/temp/agent/repair-selection-baseline-probe-20260910/report.json`.

This adds only the existing English before repair to the completed source-evidence whole-chunk treatment.
Source evidence,
candidate wording,
authorship,
fallbacks,
system criteria and original judge window remain fixed.
The existing English is comparison context for what was already carried,
not independent factual authority.
Every offered candidate is an actual changed text,
not the unchanged baseline;
no model identity is disclosed through this comparison block.

The probe calls only the stock whole-chunk selector,
with at most twenty-four requests and the same 360000/1200000 ms bounds.
The offline plan checks both the candidate-sheet transformation and recovery-message preservation.
No new writing or invented composite is introduced.
The actual whole-chunk selector chooses GLM-5.3's correct-disclosure candidate at weight five over six ballots,
not by fallback.
Its group-name mutation remains the separate task 21 blocker.
The run logged 0.00079041 USD on Bedrock,
one OpenRouter call reporting zero,
and two unpriced Hyper plus one unpriced Synthetic call.
The daily helper ran afterward.

## Implemented packet and evidence boundaries

Task 22 implements the measured cluster review unit in `panel-stage.ts`,
re-exported from `repair-stages.ts`.
All packets and local claim/group maps are materialized before the first panel call.
`mapOverlapped` with overlap one bounds packet execution;
no vote creates another packet or generation round.
Every packet uses the unchanged electorate and independent resolver/tally.
The union of heard identities is reporting only,
never a quorum basis.

`repair-evidence-role.ts` supplies the measured current-coverage versus factual-evidence distinction
in critic and panel context blocks.
The panel accepts optional `documentSourceText`;
local critic quote anchoring remains unchanged.
The three red packet guards fail on the old implementation in `06d120f74`.
Implementation `53a249bb1` and subsequent fixture/formatting commits are locally verified through `5c10ed0eb`.
The full suite ends `unit exit 0` in `~/temp/agent/cluster-panel-final-unit-20260910.out`.
The built public stage reproduces thirty cached stock-window requests with zero misses
and exactly twenty-one measured issue decisions:
`~/temp/agent/cluster-panel-runtime-replay-20260910.out`.
Ordinary no-context critic/panel prompts remain byte-identical in
`~/temp/agent/panel-prompt-parity-20260910.out`.

Task 23 threads same-entry source evidence from `repair-slice-settle.ts`
through the cache key,
twin key,
purchase,
repair chunk,
panel and existing repair selectors.
An unchanged full source equal to the current slice is not redundantly supplied by the corpus caller.
A changed document outside the local window changes the repair key.
It does not change initial translation-writer prompts.

`repair-selection-evidence.ts` supplies the measured nearby/document evidence to both selector granularities.
Whole-chunk selection also receives the existing English before repair from its known untouched fallback.
This is comparison context,
not an extra candidate or independent factual authority.
`editor-envelope-context.ts` extracts the existing bounded English-context helper to preserve the module line budget.

The three red evidence/key guards in `6b8921898` fail before implementation `05c736e4e`.
Additional guards exercise the actual prepared-document and editor-stage handoffs,
not only helper strings.
Build,
types,
zero-warning lint and the complete suite pass through `8adb77fb9`.
`~/temp/agent/evidence-handoff-unit-20260910.out` ends `unit exit 0` at line 9125;
post-format focused tests also pass.
`~/temp/agent/repair-selection-parity-20260910.out`
proves the compiled regional and whole-chunk prompts match the measured treatments.
No-context regional prompts remain unchanged.

One type-check was started before changed built declarations were ready and emitted TS2353.
The after-build type-check passes;
future public-API verification must rebuild before checking tests that import built declarations.
Proposed instruction clarification:
`CM6` should mention this ordering when public APIs change.
No `AGENTS.md` amendment was made.

The implementation-review advisor request timed out;
no endorsement is attributed to that call.
Verification rests on the named tests,
parity checks and public-stage replay.

A read-only census of the unchanged pinned corpus finds ninety-two source pages;
`XingZ60` is largest at 16733 UTF-16 characters and 41720 bytes.
The census is `~/temp/agent/original-evidence-size-20260910.json`.
This is size evidence,
not proof of model comprehension or a new truncation policy.

## Active compiled full-path check

`proc_ccdb` is `translation-repair-temporal-implemented-path-probe-20260910`.
Script:
`~/temp/agent/probe-temporal-implemented-path-20260910.mjs`.
Plan:
`~/temp/agent/temporal-implemented-path-plan-20260910.out`.
Log:
`~/temp/agent/temporal-implemented-path-probe-20260910.log`.
Report:
`~/temp/agent/temporal-implemented-path-probe-20260910/report.json`.

It executes actual `repairChunk` on frozen `.frozen-dist-8adb77fb9`,
without intercepting prompts.
The same-entry original is supplied through the implemented argument.
Completed prompt stores are merged into a new disposable store;
conflicting records stop setup instead of silently overwriting a response.
The bound remains one slice,
120 JSON requests,
360000 ms per exchange and 1200000 ms globally.
Read selected text and the complete decision path before completing task 23 or resuming task 19's final verification.
Task 21 remains separate and no full Mio pass is active.
