# No-loop production remediation proposal

## Status

Proposal,
2026-09-01,
implementing the
[post-redesign direction decision](../decision/translation-repair-post-redesign-direction.md)
and its no-loops refinement
("loops are discouraged altogether...
Discouraged,
not a ban.
You can overrule on this if you provide enough evidence and get an approval").
Grounded in
[`translation-repair-redesign-insights.md`](translation-repair-redesign-insights.md).
Supersedes the loop-bound shape in
[`translation-repair-bounded-quality-termination.md`](translation-repair-bounded-quality-termination.md).
Needs owner approval on the two decision points at the end before code.

## Why the loops exist, and why they go

The blocking review and its correction loops are all takeover additions,
landed 2026-08-27 through 2026-08-29 (`git log --follow` on each module):
overlapped consolidation on 08-27 (`e8f6e78e9`),
the blocking absolute-naturalness review on 08-28 (`6fadd3be0`),
correction first bounded the same day (`4a60a660e`, "allow bounded follow-up correction"),
then continuous on 08-29 (`1d16d89c4`, `97fda9f95`),
with the translate and archive-block continuations the same day (`ed756993b`, `ccaad1f53`).
None of this machinery predates the takeover.
The owner's stated rationale for removing it:
they were built "under an assumption that models are bad,
which isn't really true as of today".
The loops compensate for weak model output by re-asking until a panel is satisfied;
with current-generation models the compensation is the cost center,
not the safety net,
and the stopped Carena run measured it buying churn rather than convergence.

## Design rule

Every model stage is a producer or a selector inside a fixed-depth graph.
No stage may reject without replacing,
no response creates work,
and reviews are recorded evidence,
never withholding authority.
This is the owner's own corrected-requirements language applied at slice scale,
where the insights show responses fit completion budgets and the wide OCR-bridged roster stays usable.

Where a bounded second round exists it is a statically named graph node,
not a loop:
depth is fixed before the first provider call.

## The six loops and their replacements

### Consolidation naturalness correction, removed

`settleNaturalnessCorrections` and the absolute-naturalness review's blocking authority go away.
Consolidation becomes:
produce slate once,
judged selection once,
deterministic gates
(preservation,
structure,
declared names),
then one fixed polish round:
refiners propose,
judges select between proposal and standing text,
and the deterministic guard applies to whichever was selected.
A declined proposal, and equally a selected proposal the guard rejects,
leaves the standing text shipping with the outcome recorded as a finding;
this node has no re-ask under any outcome.
Absolute-naturalness findings are recorded as evidence on the settlement.

Evidence:
86 percent of the stopped Carena run's consolidation round time was post-quorum grace;
acceptance demanded near-unanimity of eight seats and passed 5 of 46 times;
22 of 40 blocks came from a single seat;
serial correction without located evidence measurably degrades text (D1.3);
and the judged-contest form is the one that produced the page a reading accepted.

### Consolidation recovery, single attempt

`buyConsolidationSlice` makes one attempt.
When standing may not ship and the settlement still needs recovery,
deterministic selection takes the best produced candidate;
zero produced candidates remain the bounded provider error.

### Translate follow-up, fixed depth two

Initial production plus at most one statically named follow-up round carrying the judge's located rejection evidence.
After that the slice settles as unfilled or incumbent-kept,
never as a thrown entry.

This is the one rejection-driven second round the proposal retains,
so it is where "discouraged, not a ban" is being exercised.
Its evidence is adjacent, not direct:
the measured three-of-four recovery (`#230`) converted schema-mismatch re-asks,
an infrastructure class, not judge rejections;
and the redesign showed located-evidence-carrying second rounds are the one safe form
(E1 double-prime) while evidence-free serial rounds degrade text (D1.3).
Direct conversion of a quality follow-up round is unmeasured;
the four-entry pass logs it,
and if it converts nothing this round drops to depth one.
Striking it now instead is a coherent stricter choice.

### Archive-block review, single round

Unresolved blocks are retained with findings;
reviewer indecision cannot withhold the entry.

### Preparation revision, linear two-step chain

One preparation,
selected corrections applied once,
one re-preparation over the corrected archive.
Remaining unclaimed blocks become findings.
This is not a rejection-driven re-ask:
the second preparation is the structural consequence of having edited the archive,
a producer chain,
so it does not exercise the loop allowance.

### Insertion placement, single round

One coverage round;
passages still unresolved stay unfilled and flow to `UnfilledPageError`,
which remains the one bounded no-page terminal,
because no admissible candidate for required content was produced.
A placement-repair second round was considered and dropped:
no measurement shows what such a round converts,
and retaining it on symmetry alone would exercise the loop allowance without evidence.
If the four-entry pass actually hits unfilled terminals here,
that run supplies the evidence to propose the round then.

## Entry terminals after the change

The three-bucket classification from the bounded-termination plan carries over unchanged:
quality-withholding `INCOMPLETE` classes retire,
deterministic-integrity classes stay,
infrastructure and model-output classes stay.
The two-seat located-agreement floor from the zero-spend replay becomes moot for stages that no longer block;
it stays available if any blocking review survives design review.

## Portable guards landing regardless

- Truncation-as-unusable in production's `readJsonOutcome`:
  today content that parses wins even at `finish_reason=max_tokens`,
  the exact defect `doc/troubleshooting/charm-hyper-max-tokens-tool-json.md` records;
  the rejection feeds the existing bounded schema-mismatch recovery.
- Corpus-pin environment override
  (clone dir and commit),
  replacing the throwaway edits the Carena fixture runs used.

## Roster refresh options

Production's writer seats
(Qwen3.8-27B,
Kimi-K3,
gemma-4-26b)
were measured before the current Hyper top end existed.
The live Hyper catalog now carries qwen3.8-flash and qwen3.8-max (vision, 128,000 and 65,536 output),
qwen3.8-2.4t-a95b,
full glm-5.3 (262,144 output),
deepseek-v4-pro and -flash (384,000 output),
minimax-m3 (512,000 output),
and glm-5.3-flash whose own ceiling is 131,072 where the project vetted 32,000.
Synthetic's live listing today
(11 rows fetched 2026-09-01 from its models endpoint)
adds GLM-5.2 and Nemotron-3-Super-120B beyond what is seated,
so the advancement is concentrated on the Hyper side.

- R1,
  keep the measured roster:
  cleanest attribution,
  but leaves the advancement unused against the owner's stated premise.
- R2,
  seat obvious upgrades unmeasured and let the four-entry pass read the combination:
  fastest leverage;
  the owner has accepted exactly this bundling before
  ("Bundle all the improvements that could be made, in"),
  at the recorded cost that no delta attributes to one change.
- R3,
  run the existing producer-calibrate and editor-calibrate instruments over the refreshed candidate set first,
  seat winners on measurement,
  then pass:
  matches the repo's seat-on-measurement practice and vets each new route's real ceiling.
  Measured instrument cost
  (`doc/decision/translation-repair-calibration-overlap.md`,
  `doc/decision/translation-repair-multi-provider.md`):
  editor-calibrate arms ran 24.18 to 58.95 minutes wall each over four bench slices,
  and the twelve-round producer pass finished in 3,637 seconds
  before the forty-round pass that seated the writers;
  a refreshed calibration is that order of spend,
  well under a pass-scale run.

Under R3 the order is:
loop-removal code lands and is suite-, lint-, and GFP-verified;
calibration runs on that build and seats the roster;
then the four-entry pass;
then the reading.
The calibration doubles as a live smoke of the changed build before the pass spends anything,
since `producer-calibrate` drives `runTranslateStage`
(the import is in `src/corpus-run/producer-calibrate.ts`),
the lane whose follow-up depth this proposal changes.

Ranking:
R3 over R2,
because disinterested-ballot calibration has already overturned a headline ordering once
(the twelve-round table read gemma and qwen3.8-max as second and third,
and both confidence intervals contained the null;
seating on that ordering "would be reading a ranking as a result"),
and the calibration also vets routes and ceilings the pass will depend on.
R2 over R1,
because R1 spends the whole pass without testing the premise the owner named.

## What stays

Slice-scale two-lane shape,
lane contest,
deterministic guards,
slice caches,
the overlap dial,
the OCR reading lane,
the four-entry completion set,
and the pass-then-reading gate.

## Decision points

1.  Approve the loop-free shape above,
    including the one retained rejection-driven follow-up round
    (translate, fixed depth two, the only place the loop allowance is exercised)?
    Vetoing that round to depth one is a coherent stricter variant.
2.  Roster: R1, R2, or R3?
