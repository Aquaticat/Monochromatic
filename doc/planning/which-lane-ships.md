# Which lane ships

Status: PROPOSAL. Nothing is decided here.
`artifact-v2-build.ts` records `laneSelection: pending-human-decision` and says why:
which lane ships is the owner's question.
This document supplies the measurement that question needs,
and reports that the obvious automatic answers do not work.

Date: 2026-08-20.
Zero quota: every number comes from settled artifacts and the pinned corpus.

## Why it matters now

The pipeline cannot emit a finished document for an entry until one lane is chosen.
Everything else can be production ready and this would still block delivery.

## The damage instruments cannot separate the lanes

Every zero-quota damage check, over every settled artifact carrying a delivery ledger:

```text
lane       entries  slices  shipped  adjacent  document  severed  unfilled
repair          11      92       62         1         0        1         0
translate       11      92       71         0         1        0         0
```

The repair lane carries two damage events and the translate lane one.
That is not a difference.
Three events across one hundred and thirty-three shipped slices cannot rank two lanes,
and any ratio computed from them ("half the damage rate") is one event wide.

RECORDED SO IT IS NOT RE-DERIVED AS A FINDING:
these instruments are built to catch specific, rare defects.
Their rarity is the good news about the pipeline
and the reason they are useless as a lane discriminator.

## The verdict the pipeline already computes

Each comparison row carries a `verdict`, over ninety-two rows:

```text
both-differ       51   55.4%    both lanes changed the slice, and differently
translate-only    18   19.6%    only the translate lane changed it
archive-stands    12   13.0%    neither changed it
repair-only        9    9.8%    only the repair lane changed it
both-agree         2    2.2%    both produced the same text
```

Two things follow.

FIRST, the translate lane acts where the repair lane declines twice as often,
eighteen slices against nine.
That is a coverage difference, not a quality one,
and it is the strongest signal available without judging text.

SECOND, and decisively:
on more than half of all slices both lanes produced different text.
No count, ratio or guard can say which of two different renderings is better.
That is a judgement about meaning.

## So a whole-document lane choice is the wrong shape

Picking one lane for the corpus discards the better rendering on roughly half the slices,
whichever lane is picked.
The verdict distribution says the decision is PER SLICE or it is arbitrary.

## The option that fits what already exists

The translate lane already judges: `judgeTranslateSlate` picks among candidate renderings,
with the incumbent entered as one of them,
and records who won.

The same stage could be handed the repair lane's text as one more candidate.
That turns `both-differ` from an unanswerable question into the question that stage
already answers, and it needs no new judging concept, roster or prompt shape.

WHAT IT COSTS: one judging round per `both-differ` slice, which is about 55% of slices.
Not free, and not measured here, because the shape has to be agreed before it is priced.

WHAT WOULD HAVE TO BE CHECKED FIRST, since `#84` measured this judge on
preserve-or-replace and not on choose-between-two-rewrites:
whether it can rank two candidate rewrites at all,
or whether it only recognises an incumbent worth keeping.
That is a measurable question and it gates the whole option.

## What is NOT proposed

Choosing a lane by damage counts.
The measurement above shows those counts cannot carry the decision,
and a rule built on three events would be overfitting to noise
rather than to this corpus.

## A lane discriminator that looked decisive and was not

Tried 2026-08-20, refuted the same hour, recorded so it is not retried naively.

THE IDEA: a rare-word test cannot tell the translate lane's legitimate re-wording from
deletion, but NAMES AND NUMBERS survive any faithful translation.
A lane that drops a person, a place or a figure is damaging the page in either lane,
so counting those should make the two comparable.

THE PROXY: a token capitalised in the archive whose lowercase form never appears
lowercase there, plus any token containing a digit.
Sentence-initial common words were supposed to be excluded
because they appear lowercase elsewhere in the document.

IT PRODUCED A CLEAN-LOOKING SPLIT:

```text
POOLED repair      kept 362 / 389   93.1%
POOLED translate   kept 303 / 389   77.9%
```

READING WHAT IT COUNTED KILLED IT.
The supposedly lost names are dominated by ordinary words that happen to appear only
capitalised in a short document, at sentence starts, in headings and in list items,
together with list markers counted as numbers.
Genuine names are a small minority of the total.

AND THE FAILURE IS BIASED, which is what makes it dangerous rather than merely noisy.
The repair lane EDITS the incumbent, so it keeps the archive's sentence openings and
scores well on those false positives by construction.
The translate lane writes fresh prose and starts sentences differently,
so it loses them without losing any content at all.
The measurement therefore rewards the repair lane for a property that is not quality.

WHAT A REAL VERSION NEEDS: an actual named-entity list rather than a capitalisation
heuristic, or the corpus's own structured fields, which carry names directly.
Until then `#130` stands where it did: no telemetry here ranks the lanes.
