## Question from the issue

Can GitHub README rendering resolve Git LFS objects that live behind the repo's custom LFS backend
(`https://monochromatic-lfs.an1298.workers.dev`,
see `doc/runbook/lfs-r2-worker.md`)?

Answer:
no.
GitHub's Markdown renderer rewrites relative image links to `/<owner>/<repo>/raw/<ref>/<path>`.
For an LFS pointer that endpoint redirects to `media.githubusercontent.com` only when the object exists in
GitHub-hosted LFS storage.
GitHub never reads `.lfsconfig`.
docs.github.com carries no statement that github.com can fetch from a third-party LFS server,
and the 2015 GitHub blog post introducing LFS support says GitHub retrieves the asset from "the LFS server",
meaning its own store.

## Evidence

- `.gitattributes` routes `*.png`,
  `*.jpg`,
  `*.jpeg`,
  `*.gif`,
  `*.webp`,
  `*.heif`,
  `*.avif`,
  and `*.jxl` through `filter=lfs`.
- `.lfsconfig` was added in commit `933145128` (2026-06-16),
  redirecting every clone to the Worker.
- The gallery under `package/music-player/asset/readme/` was committed on 2026-09-03 (`862ea00bf`,
   `ddf896a5c`),
  after the cutover,
  so its objects were uploaded only to R2.
- A GET of the gallery pointer through `raw.githubusercontent.com` returns the pointer text as `text/plain`;
  `media.githubusercontent.com` returns 404 for the same path.
- A pre-cutover image (`package/intellij-plugin/islands-black/screenshot/islands-black.png`)
  redirects to `media.githubusercontent.com` and returns `image/png`.
- Browser check with `agent-browser` on github.com:
  the islands-black README image renders (positive control);
  every gallery image on the music-player README is broken (25 of 25).
- Probing every LFS file at HEAD against `media.githubusercontent.com`:
  110 files,
  36 present (all pre-cutover),
  74 absent.
  Every absent file is under `package/music-player/` (about 11 MB);
  the README gallery is 25 of them (about 4.2 MB).
- Only one other Markdown file in the repo embeds a raster image (`package/intellij-plugin/islands-black/README.md`),
  and it predates the cutover.
- Anonymous download from the Worker works:
  `POST /objects/batch` returns a download action and `GET /<oid>` streams bytes.
  The Worker has no HEAD handler (404) and serves `application/octet-stream`.
- The git pack is 197 MiB (`git count-objects --verbose`).

## Documentation defects found

Both `package/config/lfs-r2-worker/README.md` and `doc/runbook/lfs-r2-worker.md` claim that GitHub still stores
every object,
so the web UI keeps rendering images and deleting `.lfsconfig` rolls back cleanly.
That was true only for objects uploaded before the cutover.
Rollback today would leave `git lfs fsck` failing on 74 objects.
Both documents need correcting regardless of the chosen fix.

`doc/planning/music-player-repository-extraction.md` never mentions LFS or `.gitattributes`,
so the future `Aquaticat/music-player` repository has no decided image store.

## External facts from primary sources

- git-lfs has no native multi-endpoint push.
  The documented shape is a second remote carrying `remote.<name>.lfsurl`,
  then a separate `git lfs push <name> --all`.
  Git configuration overrides `.lfsconfig`.
  Source:
  `docs/man/git-lfs-config.adoc` and `docs/man/git-lfs-push.adoc` in git-lfs.
- GitHub LFS free plan:
  10 GiB storage and 10 GiB bandwidth per month,
  metered;
  downloads count against the repository owner;
  with a zero budget,
  overage blocks GitHub LFS for the rest of the month.
  Web views are not documented either way.
  Source:
  <https://docs.github.com/en/billing/concepts/product-billing/git-lfs>.
- A later `.gitattributes` line such as `package/*/asset/readme/*.png !filter !diff !merge` overrides `*.png`.
  git-lfs itself emits this form in `commands/command_migrate_export.go`.
  Re-adding files converts them without rewriting history.
- GitHub proxies README images through camo,
  which rejects non-`image/*` content types and defaults to a 5 MiB cap
  (`atmos/camo` README and `mime-types.json`;
  the production settings are not documented).
- Cloudflare Workers free plan:
  100,000 requests per day,
  then Error 1027.
  Source:
  <https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/>.

## Options

### A. Mirror LFS objects to GitHub LFS

Keep `.lfsconfig` on R2 for clones.
Pushing machines also push LFS objects to GitHub's LFS endpoint through a second remote.
Backfill the 74 absent objects now.

Pros:
README source unchanged;
no history growth;
stays inside the existing LFS policy;
repairs the broken rollback path;
clean handoff at extraction because the objects are local.

Cons:
a second write per push that needs automation plus a guard;
GitHub LFS storage and per-view bandwidth use;
a blocked month regresses README rendering to today's state while clones keep using R2.

### B. Plain git blobs for Markdown-embedded images

Add a `.gitattributes` negation for `**/asset/readme/**` and re-add the gallery as blobs.

Pros:
no moving parts;
renders on GitHub,
forks,
mirrors,
and the extracted repository.

Cons:
about 4.2 MB enters the pack now and again on every regeneration,
permanently;
carves an exception into the LFS policy;
every bot clone downloads it.

### C. Absolute Worker URLs in the README

Use oid URLs or add a path-resolving Worker route,
plus content-type sniffing and HEAD support.

Pros:
nothing stored twice;
free egress.

Cons:
README stops using relative links;
public docs hard-code a `workers.dev` hostname that cannot move to `aquati.cat` on the free plan
(`doc/troubleshooting/cloudflare-mirror-evaluation.md`);
Worker code and tests grow;
the extracted repository would depend on Monochromatic's Worker;
README views draw on the Worker's daily request ceiling.

### D. Host gallery copies on the aquati.cat site

Pros:
owned domain.

Cons:
docs coupled to SSG deploys;
duplicate copies;
same README divergence as C.

### E. Delete `.lfsconfig` and return to GitHub LFS

Reverses the metered-bandwidth decision the Worker exists for.

### Ranking

A > B > C > D > E.
A over B because B grows every clone permanently per regeneration while A keeps binaries out of history and fixes rollback.
B over C because B has no runtime dependency and C pins a `workers.dev` hostname into public docs.
C over D because C reuses existing infrastructure.
D over E because E reintroduces the clone bandwidth bill.

## Decisions so far

Round 1 and round 2 answers from the user on 2026-09-06:

- Option C (absolute Worker URLs in Markdown) is chosen,
  with immutable oid URLs and automation.
  The user asked for a bigger automation design than a link-rewriting task.
- Rollback to GitHub LFS is not supported for now.
  The runbook and Worker README must say so instead of promising a one-step rollback.
- Every Markdown-embedded LFS image gets a Worker URL,
  including the pre-cutover islands-black screenshot.
- Regression guard is a local check task plus a one-time browser verification against github.com.
- The image store for the extracted music-player repository stays undecided.

Measured facts that settled further points without a question:

- Worker analytics (Cloudflare GraphQL,
   2026-08-25 to 2026-09-06):
  865 requests over 8 active days,
  392 on the busiest day,
  zero errors.
  GitHub reported 10,515 clones and 119 views over the same fortnight,
  so bot clones do not smudge LFS through the Worker.
  The Worker stays on the free plan (100,000 requests a day).
- The Cloudflare account has no zones,
  so no custom hostname is possible;
  `workers.dev` stays.
- Neither premise behind rejecting A and B held as stated:
  GitHub's LFS billing page says a zero budget blocks LFS for the month instead of charging,
  and the acceptable-use page has no CDN or binary-storage clause.
  The user kept C.
- This clone holds all 214 historical LFS objects and `git lfs fsck` passes.

## Automation design under discussion

- Authors keep writing relative image links.
- A fixable `cli-markdown-lint` rule rewrites any Markdown image whose target is an LFS-tracked file into
  `<origin>/<oid>/<repo-relative-path>` and corrects a drifted oid in an existing Worker URL.
  The origin derives from `.lfsconfig` `lfs.url` with userinfo stripped;
  the rule is inert when no `.lfsconfig` exists.
  The oid is the sha256 of the smudged bytes or the pointer's oid field,
  so no network access is needed.
- `git-policy-cli` pre-forward plugin policies can return fixable patches against the private index,
  so the rewrite can land inside the commit itself.
- The Worker gains `GET` and `HEAD` on `/<oid>` and `/<oid>/<path>`,
  an image content type from the extension,
  `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`,
  and an `ETag`.
  GitHub's camo proxy rejects non-image content types,
  so the content type is required.
- A mise check task fetches every Worker URL found in Markdown and asserts status 200,
  an image content type,
  and a length equal to the pointer size.
- Docs:
  correct the Worker README and runbook,
  document the URL contract,
  add an AGENTS.md rule for authors and agents.

## Round 3 decisions

Answered by the user on 2026-09-06:

- The `git-policy-cli` pre-forward plugin policy autofixes staged Markdown inside the commit.
  The policy ships inside the trusted config artifact,
  so changed bytes need `git cli-git trust --yes` after review.
- The rewrite rule covers every Markdown and MDX file markdown-lint walks,
  with an exclude option.
- The Worker moves to TypeScript with unit tests over an in-memory bucket.
- Post-push verification is a mise check task now;
  a post-push policy stage is tracked in issue #492.
- No `AGENTS.md` rule for now.
  The user fears a rule could block ordinary work;
  the decision is tracked as undecided in issue #491.

## Implementation log

- 2026-09-06,
  Worker:
  `package/config/lfs-r2-worker` converted to TypeScript with handler modules,
  `GET` and `HEAD` on `/<oid>/<path>` with image media types,
  immutable cache headers,
  `ETag` with `If-None-Match`,
  and unit tests over an in-memory store.
  workerd rejects non-handler named exports on the main module,
  so the wrangler entry is `src/worker.ts` and the library surface is `src/index.ts`.
  Deployed as version `b1781083`;
  the local `wrangler dev` probe and the production probe both passed every read and write path.
- 2026-09-06,
  module-logger:
  the default logger ran sink verification at import,
  which Cloudflare Workers forbid in global scope.
  Reported as issue #493;
  the maintainer fixed it in commit `b333197d5` (lazy singleton,
  `sideEffects: false`),
  so the Worker imports `tagged` at module scope without a workaround.
- 2026-09-06,
  markdown-lint:
  rule `lfs-image-url` landed with `--lfs-image-exclude=<pattern>`.
  Running it over the whole repository found the expected 25 gallery links and the islands-black screenshot,
  and also 16 images in `package/ssg/aquati.cat/src/content/**/*.mdx` that reference LFS-tracked `.avif` files.
  The earlier claim that no SSG MDX embeds LFS images was wrong:
  that search had matched nothing because of a bad glob combination.
  The site serves those images through its own build,
  so the root `lint:markdown` and `format:markdown` tasks pass `--lfs-image-exclude=package/ssg/`,
  exactly the exclude case the user anticipated when choosing the all-files scope.
- Pre-existing lint debt noted,
  not touched:
  the older markdown-lint rule tests import package source,
  which `test-import/require-eventual-artifact` now rejects (56 findings).
  The new tests import the built entry.
- 2026-09-06,
  cli-git policy:
  `package/git-policy/markdown-lint` ships `markdownLintPlugin` with the `autofix` policy,
  mirrored into cli-git by file-enforcer and registered as `markdown/autofix` at `warn`
  with `rules: ['lfs-image-url']` and `exclude: ['package/ssg/']` (commit `4c815fb13`).
  The adapter pipes each Markdown candidate through `cli-markdown-lint --fix --stdin-path`
  and emits a full-content `git-unified` patch.
  Its tests caught a real defect before landing:
  `nano-spawn` strips the final newline from `stdout`,
  so every candidate looked rewritten;
  the adapter now uses raw `spawn` with stream consumers.
  The neutral `git-policy-api` package had drifted from cli-git's api copy since `6e6113ba7`
  (`canApplyPatches` and the `final-newline` id were missing);
  both were ported.
- 2026-09-06,
  proof inside a commit:
  a throwaway repository trusting only the new plugin committed a README with a relative LFS link,
  and `git show HEAD:README.md` carried the object URL while the working tree kept the relative link.
  cli-git applies autofix patches to the commit,
  not to the working tree,
  so `git status` shows the file modified until `git checkout -- <file>`;
  the same holds for the built-in `final-newline` policy.
- 2026-09-06,
  READMEs:
  `git cli-git fix --policy markdown/autofix` rewrote the 25 gallery links in `package/music-player/README.md`
  and the screenshot link in `package/intellij-plugin/islands-black/README.md` (commit `d33447248`).
- 2026-09-06,
  verification:
  `mise run //package/config/lfs-r2-worker:check:markdown-urls` performed a `HEAD` request for all 26 embedded URLs
  and every one returned `200`,
  an `image/png` content type,
  the pointer's oid,
  and the pointer's size.
  A positive control with a byte mismatch,
  a `.txt` suffix,
  and a missing object failed all three,
  so the check can fail.
  In a logged-out headless browser,
  github.com rendered all 25 gallery images and the islands-black screenshot with `naturalWidth > 0`.
- Rollback to GitHub LFS is recorded as unsupported for now in the Worker README and runbook;
  if ever needed it is a planned project (re-upload objects,
  rewrite Markdown links,
  drop `.lfsconfig`),
  not a runbook step.
- Follow-ups tracked as issues:
  #491 (AGENTS.md rule,
   undecided),
  #492 (post-push policy stage),
  #496 (`lint:types` is a no-op because the built `tsc-filter` stub re-exports nothing).
