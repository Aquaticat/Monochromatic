# Plan: generate WireGuard AllowedIPs

Status:
 implemented specification.
 Recovered from Pi session `019fa835-e9e8-7523-9746-e9b7a0305a84`,
 simplified and implemented on 2026-07-28.

## Goal

The `wg-allowedips` CLI computes a WireGuard `AllowedIPs` value from an allowed set and a disallowed set:

```text
result = union(allowed) − union(disallowed)
```

Each set may contain:

- IPv4 addresses;
- IPv6 addresses;
- IPv4 CIDR blocks;
- IPv6 CIDR blocks;
- autonomous system numbers;
- domains.

A domain contributes every address returned for it by the operating system resolver during that run.
The tool must preserve this direct set model.
It must not infer `0.0.0.0/0` or `::/0` from a disallowed entry.

## Package and command

Create the package with these identities:

- Path is `package/cli/wg-allowedips`.
- Package name is `@monochromatic-dev/cli-wg-allowedips`.
- Executable name is `wg-allowedips`.

The command contract is:

```text
wg-allowedips --allowed <path> --disallowed <path>
```

Both flags are required.
An empty disallowed file represents an empty set.
Do not add short aliases or positional input.
Do not add interactive prompts or alternate output modes.

Add `cidr-tools: '>=12.1.3'` to the pnpm catalog.
The package must depend on it through `catalog:`.
This validated version floor supports Node 22 or newer and has the required array input for both `excludeCidr`
parameters.

Call `excludeCidr(allowedNetworks, disallowedNetworks)` directly.
The operation unions both arrays before subtraction and returns a minimized sorted set of IPv4 and IPv6
networks.
Do not build another merge or interval layer around it.

## Input format

Each file is plain text with one entry per line.
For each line:

1. Trim surrounding whitespace.
2. Skip it when the result is empty or starts with `#`.
3. Treat a valid IP literal as one host address.
4. Treat an entry containing `/` as a CIDR block.
5. Treat a case-insensitive `AS<number>` entry as an autonomous system number.
6. Treat any other entry as a domain for name resolution.

Validate IP literals with `isIP` from `node:net`.
For a CIDR entry use `parseCidr` from `cidr-tools` and validate its address portion with `isIP`.
Reject a prefix above 32 for IPv4 or above 128 for IPv6.
This closes the bounds gap in the dependency's deliberately rudimentary validation without adding another
validation dependency.

A range means a CIDR block such as `10.0.0.0/8`.
Start-to-end syntax such as `10.0.0.1-10.0.0.20` is unsupported.
Comments occupy a whole trimmed line.
Inline comments are unsupported.

Resolve domains with `lookup` from `node:dns/promises` and `{ all: true }`.
This follows the operating system's name-resolution behavior.
That behavior includes hosts-file and split-horizon results.
Use every returned address as a host route.
When lookup reports `ENOTFOUND`,
write one warning to stderr for that domain and let the entry contribute no addresses.
Propagate every other lookup failure.
The generated result is a point-in-time snapshot.

Resolve ASNs through the shared IPinfo Lite integration under `package/config/tofu`.
Each ASN contributes every matching database network or single address.
Reuse its per-ASN cache,
month-scale refresh policy,
`IPINFO_TOKEN` configuration,
and stale-cache fallback.
Fail an ASN entry that contributes no networks.

Do not add:

- DNS caching;
- retries or backoff;
- TTL handling;
- resolver configuration.

## Processing and output

After parsing and resolving both files:

1. Fail when the allowed set is empty.
2. Pass both sets directly to `excludeCidr`.
3. Join a nonempty result with `, ` and write one newline-terminated line to stdout.
4. Write nothing to stdout when the result is empty.

Every emitted token must include a CIDR prefix.
Individual IPv4 and IPv6 inputs therefore become `/32` and `/128` host routes.

Keep name resolution as an internal seam of the function that turns both file texts into output text.
Production passes the Node lookup adapter.
Tests pass a deterministic lookup adapter.
Do not expose this seam through the package interface.

Example:

```text
# allowed.txt
10.0.0.0/8
2001:db8::/126
```

```text
# disallowed.txt
10.0.0.0/9
2001:db8::/127
```

```console
$ wg-allowedips --allowed allowed.txt --disallowed disallowed.txt
10.128.0.0/9, 2001:db8::2/127
```

The output is only the value.
It does not include `AllowedIPs =`.

## Failure behavior

These conditions must fail the command before it writes a result:

- a required flag is missing;
- an input file cannot be read;
- a CIDR parser rejects an entry;
- a domain lookup fails;
- an ASN database lookup fails without a cached fallback;
- an ASN contributes no networks.

Let argument-parser and filesystem errors propagate.
Let CIDR-parser and resolver errors propagate.
The explicit prefix-bound error must name the rejected entry.
Do not add retry loops or custom line-number diagnostics.
Do not add a separate exit-code taxonomy.

Set arithmetic needs no special diagnostics:

- Duplicate and overlapping allowed entries merge naturally.
- A disallowed entry outside the allowed set is a no-op.
- Partial overlap subtracts only the intersection.
- An empty disallowed set returns the minimized allowed set without a warning.
- Complete subtraction succeeds with empty stdout.

## Non-goals

Do not add:

- WireGuard or `wg-quick` configuration editing;
- non-portable `!` exclusion syntax;
- an implicit full-tunnel universe;
- arbitrary start-to-end address ranges;
- warnings for duplicates or overlap;
- warnings for cancellation or no-op exclusions;
- persistent state or network watching;
- automatic regeneration;
- JSON or TOML input;
- multiple output formats.

## Completion criteria

The package must include:

- normal repository scaffolding;
- `README.md`;
- license material;
- tests for every exported code path.

Tests must cover:

- IPv4 union and subtraction;
- IPv6 union and subtraction;
- individual IPs becoming host routes;
- deterministic domain results entering the correct set through the test lookup adapter;
- deterministic ASN results entering both sets through the test lookup adapter;
- ASN database single addresses becoming host routes;
- empty and invalid ASN results;
- blank and comment lines;
- duplicate and overlapping inputs;
- partial-overlap and out-of-set inputs;
- empty allowed behavior;
- empty disallowed behavior;
- empty result behavior;
- CIDR parser failure;
- lookup failure;
- missing flag and missing file failures;
- exact stdout formatting.

These package tasks must pass with zero lint findings:

- `lint`;
- `lint:types`;
- `test:unit`;
- `build`.

Finally invoke the built `wg-allowedips` executable against disposable input files.
Verify its stdout and exit status.
