## Recommendation

**Ranking: B > D > A > C.**

### 1. B: match the credential-bearing core

Use:

```regex
\bmongodb(?:\+srv){0,1}://[!-9;-~]{3,50}:[!-?A-~]{3,88}@
```

This best matches the scanning objective. The secret-bearing evidence is the MongoDB scheme followed by bounded user information and an unambiguous `@` delimiter.

- **Coverage:** catches ordinary, SRV, replica-set, IPv6, query-string, long-hostname, and interpolated-host forms because it does not validate irrelevant suffix syntax.
- **False positives:** adds malformed or incomplete URI fragments, but the main false positives will still be placeholders such as `username:password@host`. A complete host grammar does not eliminate those.
- **State behavior:** the username class excludes `:`, and the password class excludes `@`. These delimiters make the phases deterministic and remove the nested hostname and replica counters.
- **Maintainability:** this is a principled exception: “match the credential-bearing prefix rather than validate the complete connection string.” That is easier to defend than arbitrary host-count and length limits.

B also catches source composition such as:

```text
mongodb://alice:s3cret@${MONGO_HOST}
mongodb://alice:s3cret@" + mongoHost
```

A complete-URI rule can miss both even though the credential has leaked.

### 2. D: require only a plausible literal host introducer

If B produces unacceptable noise, use a minimal suffix check:

```regex
\bmongodb(?:\+srv){0,1}://[!-9;-~]{3,50}:[!-?A-~]{3,88}@
(?:[A-Za-z0-9]|\[|%)
```

This recognizes the start of:

- DNS names and IPv4 addresses
- bracketed IPv6 literals
- percent-encoded host or Unix-socket forms

It retains near-core state behavior and avoids all replica, port, path, and query counters.

I rank it below B because it misses interpolated, concatenated, or truncated hosts, while doing little about valid-looking placeholder examples.

### 3. A: context-appropriate bounds

A is defensible when retaining source-rule shape is more important than coverage.

Its disadvantages are substantive:

- `{0,8}` replica hosts means at most nine hosts including the initial host.
- A leading hostname character followed by `{1,128}` means a total length of 2 to 129 bytes.
- The inherited suffix does not model full MongoDB URI syntax despite appearing to validate it.
- The trailing path expression does not accept common query forms such as `/?retryWrites=true`.
- Bracketed IPv6, percent-encoded socket paths, one-character hosts, and source interpolation remain unsupported.
- Bounds become policy constants requiring continuing justification.

Measure and record the actual determinized state count. Smaller textual bounds do not alone establish adequate headroom in a derivative implementation.

### 4. C: split rules

Splitting lowers the cap exposure per rule, but:

- duplicates the credential-prefix automaton and documentation;
- can produce overlapping findings;
- leaves the replica rule with nested counters;
- preserves the same host, query-string, IPv6, and interpolation gaps unless each rule is redesigned.

If A still exceeds the measured cap, C becomes the fallback. If splitting, divide by actual grammar, such as SRV versus standard MongoDB, rather than merely single-host versus replica-set.

## Additional simplification

Assuming `\w` includes ASCII digits, this alternation is redundant:

```regex
(?:[a-zA-Z0-9][\w.-]+|\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3})
```

Every dotted-decimal branch match is already accepted by `[a-zA-Z0-9][\w.-]+`. Removing the IPv4 branch preserves the represented language while removing overlapping NFA paths. Apply this simplification if retaining A or C.

## Important coverage pitfalls

Test explicitly for:

- `mongodb+srv`, which normally has one seed hostname rather than a replica list or explicit port;
- `?options` after the host or authentication database;
- bracketed IPv6;
- percent-encoded reserved credential characters such as `%40`;
- percent-encoded Unix-socket paths, if relevant;
- host interpolation and string concatenation;
- punctuation after the URI such as `)`, `]`, or `,`;
- mixed-case schemes, if accepted by target drivers;
- URIs split across lines, which no line-at-a-time rule can fully recognize;
- raw non-ASCII credentials, which the current byte classes exclude.

Also verify downstream behavior when B ends at `@`. Match-based deduplication may merge the same credential used with different hosts, and match-only displays will omit host context.

Document B as an intentional semantic port:

> Preserve the original credential payload, but omit non-secret URI suffix validation to avoid determinization blow-up and to cover valid, templated, and partially constructed connection strings.

That rationale should remain stable even if MongoDB host syntax evolves.
