# Pi model retirement extension proposal

Status: accepted and implemented.
The design session that produced this file was held 2026-10-02, the package is delivered at
`package/pi-plugin/model-retirement`, and the decision is recorded in
`doc/decision/pi-model-retirement.md`.
This file keeps the full evidence trail: the measurements, the rule, the rejected options,
and the risks as they were understood at each step.

## Purpose

Retire superseded models from pi's live catalog so the model picker shrinks and so a
superseded model cannot be selected on a path nobody watches.
Measured starting point on this machine: `pi --list-models` prints 525 rows across
10 providers, 399 of them `openrouter`, and the bundled catalog underneath holds
1604 entries across 42 providers.

## Settled decisions

Each item below was decided by the user during the grilling session.

1. Scope is within-family superseded models only.
   Whole-provider removal is out of scope, so the 399 `openrouter` rows stay except
   where a family inside that provider is superseded.
2. Mechanism is per-provider re-registration with a filtered model list, installed from
   the `session_start` handler.
   Rationale: it is the only catalog mutation pi exposes, and the host probe measured
   that `session_start` is the earliest point where any registry read is possible.
   Accepted consequence: `--list-models` and the startup model choice are both settled
   before the filter runs.
3. Retirement is automatic at every load, with no approval step and no curated
   retirement list.
4. There is no runtime escape hatch: no allowlist, no environment override.
   The only recovery paths are rebuilding the package or removing it from `packages`.
5. The extension writes no pi settings, neither `enabledModels` nor `defaultModel`.
6. Tier suffixes such as `flash`, `pro`, `mini`, `batch`, and `lite` form separate
   families, so a cheaper or faster variant is never retired by a larger one.
7. An entry whose id carries no version token is never retired.
   This protects rolling aliases and routing targets such as `auto`,
   `syn:large:text`, and `openai/gpt-4o`.
8. There is no context-window regression guard.
   A newer model with a smaller context window still retires the older larger one.
9. Every retirement is logged through a tagged logger.
   There is no audit task.
   The load-time log and the pinned characterization fixture are the only two surfaces
   for the retirement table.
10. A session that starts on a retired model is not corrected and not switched.
    The consequence is recorded under "Implementation risks".
11. The package is documented as belonging last in the global `packages` array, and a
    misordered install warns rather than throws.
    The host probe weakened this constraint: by `session_start` every provider package
    has already flushed, so ordering matters only against an extension that registers
    providers from a later event handler.
12. Cross-provider duplicates are left alone; families never span providers.
    `kimi-k3` on five providers stays on five providers.
13. Package directory `package/pi-plugin/model-retirement`, package name
    `@monochromatic-dev/pi-plugin-model-retirement`.

## Why native pi mechanisms cannot do this

All paths are relative to the installed
`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent@1.0.0` and `@earendil-works/pi-ai@1.0.0`.
The same findings, with runnable harnesses and the full catalog of what works and what
fails, are in `doc/troubleshooting/pi-extension-model-catalog.md`.

- `enabledModels` does not hide models.
  `dist/modes/interactive/components/model-selector.js:39,52,119,201-219` shows the
  picker defaulting to `scope = "scoped"` when a scope exists and binding Tab to
  `setScope`, which switches `activeModels` to `this.allModels`.
  The setting narrows the default view and Ctrl+P cycling, nothing more.
- Model selection cannot be vetoed.
  `dist/core/extensions/types.d.ts:1179` declares
  `on(event: "model_select", handler: ExtensionHandler<ModelSelectEvent>)` with no
  result type, unlike `tool_call` at `:1181` which returns `ToolCallEventResult`.
  `AgentSession.setModel` assigns `agent.state.model` before emitting
  (`dist/core/agent-session.js:1910-1926`).
- Extensions cannot write settings.
  `pi.getSettings()` returns a structured clone
  (`dist/core/settings-manager.js:305-307`), and `SettingsManager.setEnabledModels()`
  is not reachable from `ExtensionAPI`.
- The only catalog mutations are provider-level.
  `registerProvider(name, config)` whose `models` array replaces every model of that
  provider (`dist/core/provider-composer.js:171-178`, applied at `:329`), and
  `unregisterProvider(name)` (`dist/core/extensions/types.d.ts:1328`).
  There is no `filterModels`, no `removeModel`, and no `modelsChanged` event.
- No model carries age metadata.
  `BaseModel` (`pi-ai/dist/types.d.ts:900-912`) has `id`, `name`, `api`, `provider`,
  `baseUrl`, `input`, `inputLimits`, `cost`, and `headers`.
  A sweep of all 42 bundled catalog files found no per-model date, deprecation, or
  version field; the only timestamp is catalog-wide
  (`pi-ai/dist/providers/data/.manifest.json`, `generatedAt: 2026-10-01T18:57:11.882Z`).
  An "older than N months" rule therefore has no data source.
- Startup model resolution precedes extension registration.
  `findInitialModel` runs in `dist/core/sdk.js:92-118` and `dist/main.js:657-674`,
  before `new AgentSession` flushes `pendingProviderRegistrations`
  (`dist/core/agent-session.js:197`, `dist/core/runner.js:248-267`).

## Host probe results

Probe run 2026-10-02 in a disposable host: `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` pointed at a temporary
directory whose only content was a `models.json` carrying one `modelOverrides` entry,
`openai-codex/gpt-6-luna` with `contextWindow` 750000 against the bundled 272000, plus
one throwaway extension loaded with `--extension`.
No credentials were copied and no real settings file was read or written.
Two invocations: `pi --list-models --no-extensions --extension <probe>`, and
`pi --mode rpc --no-extensions --extension <probe>` with a single
`get_available_models` command on stdin.

- The factory cannot read the catalog, confirmed at runtime and not only in types.
  Its own property names are `appendEntry`, `events`, `exec`, `getActiveTools`,
  `getAllTools`, `getCommands`, `getFlag`, `getMcpServers`, `getSessionName`,
  `getSettings`, `getThinkingLevel`, `on`, `registerCommand`, `registerEntryRenderer`,
  `registerFlag`, `registerMarkdownTransformer`, `registerMcpServer`,
  `registerMessageRenderer`, `registerProvider`, `registerShortcut`, `registerTool`,
  `registerVirtualModel`, `sendMessage`, `sendUserMessage`, `setActiveTools`,
  `setLabel`, `setModel`, `setSessionName`, `setThinkingLevel`, `unregisterMcpServer`,
  `unregisterProvider`, and `unregisterVirtualModel`.
  None exposes `getAll`, and `pi.modelRegistry`, `pi.models`, `pi.registry`, and
  `pi.modelRuntime` are all absent.
- `--list-models` fires no extension event.
  Only the factory ran; `resources_discover`, `session_start`, and `session_shutdown`
  never fired, so no event-handler filter can reach that command.
- Availability is auth-filtered, and `getAll()` is not.
  In the credential-free host `--list-models` printed "No models available" and the
  `get_available_models` response carried an empty array, while
  `ctx.modelRegistry.getAll()` in the same process returned 1532 entries.
- Event order in RPC mode: `session_start` at +30ms, `resources_discover` at +31ms,
  `session_shutdown` at +37ms.
  `session_start` is the earliest event carrying `ctx.modelRegistry`.
- `models.json` overrides are visible at `session_start`.
  `openai-codex/gpt-6-luna` reported `contextWindow` 750000, the overridden value, not
  the bundled 272000, which closes the override-loss risk for this registration point.
- `getAll()` returns chat models only.
  The bundled catalog holds 1604 entries: 1532 chat, 57 image, and 15 classifier, and
  `getAll()` returned exactly 1532.
  The other types are reachable through `getModelsOfType(type, provider)` and
  `getAvailableOfType` (`dist/core/model-registry.d.ts:41-45`).
- The registry read carries every field a re-registration needs.
  Observed keys on the target model: `api`, `baseUrl`, `compat`, `contextWindow`,
  `cost`, `id`, `input`, `inputLimits`, `maxTokens`, `name`, `promptCache`, `provider`,
  `reasoning`, `samplingParams`, `thinkingLevelMap`, and `type`.
- `ExtensionContext` at `session_start` exposes `abort`, `compact`, `cwd`,
  `getContextUsage`, `getSystemPrompt`, `hasPendingMessages`, `hasUI`,
  `isProjectTrusted`, `mode`, `model`, `modelRegistry`, `scopedModels`,
  `sessionManager`, `shutdown`, `signal`, `thinkingLevel`, and `ui`.

## The retirement rule

The rule was designed against the measured catalog and validated by a throwaway
prototype.
It decides three things per catalog entry: its family, its version evidence, and
whether it loses to another member of the same family.
Anything it cannot order, it leaves alone.

### Family key

A family is `(provider, api, name-shape)`.

- `provider` and `api` come from the catalog entry, never from the id text.
  Including `api` is required: 3 ids in the bundled catalog appear under two APIs for
  the same provider (`openrouter/google/gemini-3-pro-image`, `openrouter/auto`,
  `openrouter/auto-beta`), and without `api` in the key an entry can retire its own
  sibling route.
- `name-shape` is the id lowercased, stripped of a leading `~` and of an `hf:<org>/`
  prefix, split on separators, with every version token removed and the remaining
  tokens rejoined in order.
  The `<org>/` prefix of a router id is kept, so `anthropic/claude-opus-5` and
  `openai/gpt-5.5` can never share a family.
  Keeping tier words in the name-shape is what implements decision 6.

### Version tokens

A token is a version token when its digits run to the end of the token, optionally
behind a `v` and optionally behind an alphabetic prefix.
So `5.2`, `v4`, and `0813` are version tokens, and `qwen3.8` splits into the word
`qwen` plus the version `3.8`, which is what makes `qwen3.7-flash` and
`qwen3.8-flash` members of one family.
A token whose digits are followed by letters stays a single word, so `4o`, `70b`,
`a12b`, and `2.4t` join the name-shape instead of becoming version evidence.
That distinction is what keeps parameter sizes out of the ordering: `llama-3.1-8b`
and `llama-3.1-70b` land in different families and can never retire each other.
Each version token contributes its components to a version vector and keeps its raw
text beside them, because leading zeros decide date classification: `0813` is a
month-day snapshot and `813` is not.

Tokenization and classification are a single character pass per id with no regular
expressions, matching the style of `splitModelIdTokens` in
`package/pi-shared/model-selection/src/version.ts`.

A raw numeric token is date-shaped when it is 4 digits and reads as `MMDD` or `YYMM`,
6 digits and reads as `YYMMDD`, or 8 digits and reads as `YYYYMMDD`.

### Ordering

Two entries in the same family are compared component by component over their version
vectors.

1. At the first differing component, the larger component wins, unless the two raw
   components differ in digit length by 2 or more.
   In that case the pair is unordered, because the ids are using incommensurable
   numbering schemes; `qwen3.5-plus-02-15` against `qwen3.5-plus-20260420` is the
   measured example.
2. When the vectors are equal in length and content, the entry with no date-shaped
   token wins, which keeps a rolling alias alive over a pinned snapshot.
   When both carry dates, the later date wins; when the date shapes differ, the pair
   is unordered.
3. When one vector is a strict prefix of the other, the extra raw components decide.
   All extra components date-shaped: the shorter vector wins, so
   `deepseek-v4-pro-0813` loses to `deepseek-v4-pro`.
   No extra component date-shaped: the longer vector wins, so `claude-opus-5` loses
   to `claude-opus-5-5` and `amazon.nova-lite-v1:0` loses to
   `amazon.nova-2-lite-v1:0`.
   Mixed: unordered.

### Abstention

The rule abstains, keeping both entries, when any of these hold.

- Either entry has an empty version vector (decision 7).
- The name-shapes differ, so they are not in the same family.
- Any comparison step above reports the pair unordered.
- The two entries have the same provider, api, and id.
- Keeper selection inside a family was itself ambiguous for at least one pair.

Abstention is the deliberate error direction.
Decision 4 removed every runtime override, so a false positive is recoverable only by
rebuilding the package, while a false negative costs one extra row in the picker.

### Invariants

- A retired entry's version vector is never greater than its keeper's under the
  ordering above.
  The verification suite asserts this over the whole catalog, not over samples.
- An entry with no version token is never retired and is never chosen as a keeper.
  The second half matters: a versionless entry that becomes the keeper blocks every
  retirement in its family, which was a live bug in the prototype.
- Re-registration never drops a model type.
  `getAll()` returns chat, image, and classifier models; the config shape differs per
  type (`ProviderChatModelConfig`, `ProviderImageModelConfig`,
  `ProviderClassifierModelConfig` in `dist/core/extensions/types.d.ts:1422-1470`), and
  image models require `output`.

## Measured behavior of the rule

Prototype: throwaway Python over the bundled catalog, run 2026-10-02, written as a
character scan with no regular expressions so that it validates the shape the
TypeScript implementation must take.
The prototype is not retained; the durable artifacts are the implementation and its
tests.

- Full bundled catalog, 1604 entries: 551 retirements, 29 abstentions, 0 misordered
  pairs.
  Largest contributors: `openrouter` 142, `vercel-ai-gateway` 91, `amazon-bedrock` 71,
  `opencode` 38, `azure-openai-responses` 23, `huggingface` 23, `openai` 23,
  `cloudflare-ai-gateway` 22.
- Live subset, the 481 of 525 `pi --list-models` rows that exist in the bundled
  catalog: 151 retirements, 12 abstentions, 0 misordered pairs.
  Contributors: `openrouter` 129, `radius` 9, `opencode-go` 6, `openai-codex` 3,
  `qwen-token-plan-individual` 3, `moonshotai` 1.
  The picker would therefore drop from 525 rows to about 374 before `synthetic` and
  `hyper` are counted.
  The remaining 44 live rows belong to `synthetic` and `hyper`, which are registered
  by npm packages and are absent from the bundled catalog, so the prototype could not
  evaluate them.
  The runtime rule sees them through `getAll()`; measuring them needs a host probe.
- 14 tokenizer controls pass, covering whole-numeric tokens, `v`-prefixed tokens,
  alphabetic-prefix tokens, trailing-letter tokens, parameter sizes, and each date
  width.
- 18 asserted policy controls pass and 1 is skipped because `hyper/kimi-k2-thinking`
  is not in the bundled catalog.
  They pin the three `radius` inversions, the alias-versus-snapshot pairs, the
  magnitude-guard abstentions, the versionless protections, and the size-token
  separation.
- Splitting alphabetic-prefix versions is what raised the live count from 124 to 151
  and the catalog count from 462 to 551, with no retirements removed and no keeper
  changes.
  The 27 added live retirements are families that the whole-token-only variant could
  not see at all: `qwen3.5` through `qwen3.7` against `qwen3.8`, `kimi-k2` through
  `kimi-k2.6` against `kimi-k3`, `minimax-m1` through `minimax-m2.7` against
  `minimax-m3`, and `o1` against `o3`.

Retirements the rule makes on providers in daily use, all verified correct by hand:
`opencode-go/glm-5.2` by `glm-5.3`, `opencode-go/mimo-v2.5-pro` by `mimo-v2.6-pro`,
`opencode-go/grok-4.6` by `grok-4.7`,
`opencode-go/muse-spark-1.2-contributor` by `muse-spark-1.3-contributor`,
`openai-codex/gpt-6-sol` by `gpt-6.1-sol`, `openai-codex/gpt-5.6-luna` by
`gpt-6-luna`, `radius/claude-opus-5` by `claude-opus-5-5`,
`radius/claude-sonnet-5` by `claude-sonnet-5-5`, `radius/gpt-5.4` by `gpt-5.5`,
`moonshotai/kimi-k2.6` by `kimi-k3`,
`qwen-token-plan-individual/qwen3.6-flash` by `qwen3.8-flash`, and
`qwen-token-plan-individual/qwen3.7-max` by `qwen3.8-max`.

Abstentions the rule accepts rather than guessing, all measured:
`openrouter/qwen/qwen3.5-plus-02-15` against `qwen3.5-plus-20260420`, where a
month-day pair meets an 8-digit date, and
`openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-0731` against `deepseek-v4.1-flash`, where a
snapshot component meets a minor version component.

### What the naive rule got wrong

The first candidate rule reused the ordering semantics of
`@monochromatic-dev/pi-shared-model-selection` directly.
Measured failures that motivated the design above:

- Three inversions on `radius`, a provider in daily use: `claude-fable-5-1` retired by
  `claude-fable-5`, `claude-opus-5-5` retired by `claude-opus-5`, and
  `claude-sonnet-5-5` retired by `claude-sonnet-5`.
  In each case the newer point release lost to the older base version.
- Eight live retirements where the keeper's context window was strictly smaller,
  including `gpt-5.6-luna` at 1050000 retired by `gpt-6-luna` at 272000.
  Decision 8 accepts this class.
- 89 catalog-wide retirements whose ids carry parameter-size tokens (`70b`, `120b`,
  `235b`, `a12b`), 4-digit snapshots, or glued versions, where numeric comparison of
  unlike components decided the outcome.

## Why the shared version parser is not reused

`package/pi-shared/model-selection/src/version.ts` owns model version parsing for
`advisor`, `auto-mode`, and `thinking-default`.
Its semantics are correct for picking a model out of candidates and wrong for deleting
one, in four specific ways.

1. `DATE_TOKEN_DIGIT_COUNT` is 8 (`version.ts:17`) and `isDateLikeToken` requires
   `token.length >= 8` (`version.ts:312`), so 4-digit snapshots such as `0813` and
   `2407` are read as version numbers.
2. `firstDigitRun` takes the first digit run inside any token and stops there, so
   `qwen3.8` yields 3 and loses the minor version, `gpt-4o` yields 4, and
   `llama-3.1-70b-instruct` yields 3 then 70.
   This rule splits an alphabetic prefix from trailing digits and keeps every
   component, so `qwen3.8` yields 3 then 8, while a token whose digits are followed
   by letters stays a word, so `gpt-4o` yields nothing and `70b` stays in the
   name-shape.
3. `Math.trunc(Number(digits))` discards leading zeros, so `0813` reaches the caller
   as 813 and can no longer be classified as a date downstream.
4. `compareVersions` documents "shorter vectors sort first so aliases win over dated
   snapshots", which is the tiebreak that produced the three `radius` inversions.

If a second package ever needs strict version tokens, the right move is to add a
separate extractor to `pi-shared/model-selection` rather than change
`extractVersionNumbers`, per that package's category rule requiring at least two
consumers.

## Decisions adopted by default, open to veto

These four were put to the user and not answered, so they are recorded as adopted
defaults rather than settled decisions.

1. Family key includes `api`, making the same-id-different-route invariant structural
   instead of a check a later edit can drop.
2. A session found to be running on a retired model logs a warning naming the model
   and its successor and takes no other action, which honors decision 10 while keeping
   the leak visible under decision 9.
3. A provider that resolves to zero models when the factory runs is skipped with a
   warning, and the filter runs again at `session_start` so a late registration is
   still caught.
   Without this, a misordered install would re-register a provider from an empty read
   and delete its models.
4. A `*.characterization.unit.test.ts` pins the full retirement table over the bundled
   catalog, so a pi upgrade that changes any single retirement fails the suite until
   the diff is reviewed.
   Repo precedent: `package/pi-plugin/thinking-default/src/model-policy.characterization.unit.test.ts`.
   The cost is a review commit on catalog-affecting pi upgrades.

## Rejected options

- Generate `enabledModels` from policy and let pi's native scope do the hiding.
  Rejected because the native scope does not hide, as the `model-selector.js` citations
  show.
- Veto model selection through an event result.
  Rejected because no such contract exists in pi 1.0.0.
- `unregisterProvider` for unused providers.
  Rejected by decision 1.
  It remains the cheapest fix for picker clutter if that decision is ever revisited:
  removing `openrouter` alone would drop 399 rows, and no installed npm extension
  references that provider.
- Virtual-model `route()` throw as the block.
  Rejected: it fires only for ids the extension itself registers as virtual, so it
  covers a narrow path while adding a routing surface.
- Age-based retirement.
  Rejected: no per-model date exists in the catalog.
- Aggressive ordering via the shared `compareVersions`.
  Rejected on the measured inversions.
- Source-level `keep` list for known false positives.
  Rejected by decision 3.
  Abstention replaces it: the rule declines to order ambiguous pairs instead of
  recording exceptions to a wrong ordering.
- Context-window regression guard.
  Rejected by decision 8, against the recommendation, with the measured cost recorded
  above.

## Implementation risks, ordered by severity

1. `getAll()` returns chat models only, so a filter built on it deletes image and
   classifier models on re-registration.
   Measured: 1532 chat entries against 57 image and 15 classifier, and `getAll()`
   returned exactly the chat count.
   Mitigation: read all three types through `getModelsOfType` and re-declare each with
   its own config shape, since `ProviderImageModelConfig` requires `output` and
   `ProviderClassifierModelConfig` requires `contextWindow`
   (`dist/core/extensions/types.d.ts:1422-1470`).
   A chat-only mapping would silently break `codemode` classifiers and image routes.
2. A mid-session catalog refresh can reintroduce retired models.
   `ModelRegistry.refresh()` reloads `models.json`
   (`dist/core/model-registry.d.ts:25`) and pi fetches a remote overlay from pi.dev on
   a 4-hour interval (`dist/core/remote-catalog-provider.js:5,49,76`).
   No `modelsChanged` event exists, so nothing notifies the extension.
   Mitigation: re-run the filter on every registry-carrying event that is cheap to
   handle, and accept that a refresh between two such events leaves retired entries
   visible until the next one.
3. Per-model headers are dropped.
   `extensionModelFromDefinition` returns `{ ...definition, api, provider, baseUrl,
   headers: undefined }` for all three model types
   (`dist/core/provider-composer.js:119-136`).
   Measured exposure in the bundled catalog: `github-copilot` 34 models and `nvidia`
   19, neither in the live set.
   The extension-registered providers `synthetic`, `hyper`, and `openai-codex-fast`
   cannot be inspected from the bundled catalog and must be checked in an
   authenticated host probe.
   Provider-level headers survive, since `ProviderConfig.headers` is passed through.
4. Whole-list replacement.
   `applyExtension` discards every model not present in the extension's list, so a
   partial read deletes models.
   Mitigated by adopted default 3.
5. Startup leak, accepted by decision 10, and now unavoidable rather than merely
   accepted: the probe measured `session_start` as the earliest registry read, and
   startup model resolution happens before it.
   pi keeps a removed model object when the registry lookup fails, so a session that
   resolved a retired model keeps serving from it.
   Today's `defaultModel`, `mimo-v2.6-pro` on `opencode-go`, is a keeper under the
   rule, so nothing leaks now; the exposure begins the day the default drifts.
6. Row counts are host-specific because availability is auth-filtered.
   The real host lists 525 rows, the bundled catalog holds 1532 chat entries, and the
   credential-free probe host listed none.
   Tests must assert over registry reads and retirement pairs, never over a fixed row
   count.
7. No extension API stability guarantee.
   pi's `CHANGELOG.md` carries 59 `BREAKING` mentions and the docs name source as the
   contract.
   Mitigated by the characterization suite, `verify:extension`, and a gated host probe.
8. No escape hatch, accepted by decision 4.
   Mitigations are abstention, per-retirement logging, and the
   characterization suite.
   None of them restores a model mid-session.

`package.json` follows the sibling pi-plugin shape: `"private": true`, `"type":
"module"`, the two-key `exports` block with a `./ts` subpath,
`"pi": { "extensions": ["./dist/final/node/index.mjs"] }`,
`peerDependencies` on the pi packages at `"*"`, and the same packages in
`devDependencies` at `catalog:`.
Rationale for the peer shape: `doc/troubleshooting/pi-extension-peer-deps.md`.

`mise.toml` carries the 12 tasks shared by `package/pi-plugin/thinking-default` and
`package/pi-plugin/ask-user-question`, plus two of its own: `verify:extension`
depending on `build`, and `verify:host` gated by an environment variable in a
`[tasks."verify:host".env]` block, following `package/pi-plugin/advisor/mise.toml`.

Installation goes in the README, matching the sibling convention:

```bash
# global settings only, never project .pi/settings.json, and last in the array
pi install /var/home/user/Monochromatic/package/pi-plugin/model-retirement
```

## Verification plan

1. Unit tests covering every branch of the tokenizer and the rule. Tokenizer:
   whole-numeric, `v`-prefixed, alphabetic-prefix with dotted digits, trailing-letter
   tokens, parameter sizes, and each date width. Rule: first-component difference,
   magnitude abstention, equal vectors with and without dates, prefix with date-shaped
   extras, prefix with version extras, mixed extras, versionless entries as both loser
   and keeper candidate, and same-id-different-api pairs.
   No regular expressions in the implementation, per the tokenizer requirement in
   "Version tokens".
2. The invariant assertion over the whole bundled catalog: no retirement whose loser
   orders newer than its keeper.
3. The characterization table, per adopted default 4.
4. `verify:extension` against the built `.mjs` with a fake `ExtensionAPI`, asserting
   which providers were re-registered and that no registration carried an empty model
   list.
5. `verify:host` in a disposable pi host driven over `pi --mode rpc`, asserting that
   `ctx.modelRegistry.getAll()` shrank by the expected count after `session_start`,
   that a retired id is no longer returned by `find`, that `openai-codex/gpt-6-luna`
   still reports `contextWindow` 750000, and that the image and classifier counts from
   `getModelsOfType` are unchanged.
   `--list-models` cannot carry this assertion: the probe measured that it fires no
   extension event, and that a credential-free host reports no models from it at all.
   The picker check needs one authenticated provider, so the gated task documents the
   credential it may use instead of reading the real agent directory.
6. Manual check in the interactive TUI: the picker no longer offers a retired id, and
   Tab to `all` does not bring it back.

## Delivery status

Implemented at `package/pi-plugin/model-retirement` as `@monochromatic-dev/pi-plugin-model-retirement`,
and installed into global pi settings on 2026-10-02: the `packages` array went from 17
entries to 18, the new entry was appended last, nothing was removed, and no setting outside
`packages` changed.
Pi stores a local package path relative to the home directory, so the recorded entry is
`../../../../var/home/user/Monochromatic/package/pi-plugin/model-retirement`, the same form
the existing `openai-fast` entry uses; `pi remove` accepts the absolute path anyway.

One pass in the real host after installation: chat models 1677 to 1109, 597 retirements
across 35 providers, 4 skipped with a warning each, image 57 and classifier 15 unchanged,
`radius` keeping `streamSimple`, `synthetic` keeping its credentials, and no
`extension_error` record.

Source modules: `id-tokens.ts` (tokenizer and date classification), `retirement-order.ts`
(recency ordering and the `UNORDERED` sentinel), `retirement-rule.ts` (family grouping and
the decision), `registration-gap.ts` (per-model endpoint validation and the model-config
mapping), `provider-filter.ts` (planning), `retirement-report.ts` (log wording),
`register-model-retirement.ts` (the session-start pass), `index.ts` (entry point),
`disposable-host.ts` and `verify-host.ts` (the gated host task), `verify-probe.ts` (the
companion probe pi loads from source), and `mise.verify-extension.ts` (the built-artifact
check).

Checks, all green: oxlint reports 0 warnings and 0 errors across the package, `tsc`
reports no errors, 22 unit and characterization groups pass against the built bundle,
`verify:extension` passes, and `verify:host` passes all ten assertions.
The characterization fixture pins 1604 catalog entries, 551 retirements, and the
abstention tally, and was shown to fail by mutating the pinned count before restoring it.

### Defect the real host caught

The disposable host could not see it, because it loads no other packages.
In the real host, `radius` is registered by another package with a `streamSimple` handler,
and `hyper`, `openai-fast`, and `openai-codex-fast` are native provider objects whose
configuration `getRegisteredProviderConfig` does not return.
Re-registering any of them with only a model list replaces that owner's streaming and
auth, and `radius` was already being filtered.

The planner now skips a provider that pi lists in `getRegisteredProviderIds()` but exposes
no configuration for, and spreads the incumbent configuration under the filtered model
list when there is one, so `api`, `baseUrl`, `apiKey`, `headers`, `oauth`, and
`streamSimple` survive.
Endpoint validation also accepts provider-level `api` and `baseUrl` as fallbacks, matching
how pi resolves them.

Measured in the real host, before and after one pass:

- `radius` configuration: 2 keys with `streamSimple`, then 3 keys with `streamSimple`.
  The added key is the filtered model list.
- `synthetic` configuration: 4 keys before and after, credentials intact.
- `hyper`: absent configuration, skipped rather than clobbered.
- Chat models 1677 to 1110. Image 57 and classifier 15 unchanged.
- 597 retirements across 35 providers, with 4 providers skipped: `azure-openai-responses`
  for a missing `baseUrl`, and `hyper`, `openai-codex-fast`, and `openai-fast` as native
  registrations.
- No `extension_error` record from pi.

An earlier real-host run, before per-provider isolation existed, showed why the skip
matters: pi threw `Provider azure-openai-responses: "baseUrl" is required when defining
custom models`, the pass aborted at the third provider, and only 83 of 538 retirements
applied.

### Override risk, closed

`models.json` `modelOverrides` cannot be lost by re-registration, because pi applies them
after extension model replacement: `composeModelProvider` maps the override over the list
`applyExtension` returned (`dist/core/provider-composer.js:337-353`).
The disposable host confirms it empirically: `openai-codex/gpt-6-luna` reports 750000 both
before and after filtering, against a bundled 272000.

The pass still awaits `ModelRegistry.refresh({ allowNetwork: false })` before reading, since
pi documents awaiting a refresh before synchronous registry reads.
A real-host reading of 272000 for that model is not evidence against any of this: the
override for `openai-codex` no longer exists in the local `models.json`, whose overrides now
live under `openai` and `openai-fast`, and the legacy `openai-codex` login was removed.

## Open questions

1. Should a native-provider skip be reported once per session, or only when the set of
   skipped providers changes?
   Four providers skip on this machine today, so four warning lines per session is the
   current cost of the honest option.
2. Is `radius` in scope at all, given it serves the advisor and MCP transports rather
   than interactive picks?
   It is filtered today, with its `streamSimple` preserved, and 9 of its entries retire.
3. Should `synthetic` stay filtered and `hyper` stay skipped, or should the package ask
   `hyper`'s owner to register a configuration pi can return?
   Both are extension-registered; only `synthetic` exposes one.
4. Should the fixture regeneration task also record the pi and pi-ai versions it ran
   against, so a failing characterization test names the upgrade that caused it?
