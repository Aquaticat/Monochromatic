# Whole-repo oxlint timing, first attribution

Opened against issue #374,
 which asks for a warm whole-repo `mise run lint:oxlint` under sixty
seconds.
Measured 2026-08-08 on the machine running this session.
No optimization proposed yet:
 this records where the time goes,
 because every number quoted
for this before was a cold run.

## What was measured

Warm run,
 with `node_modules/.cache/prefer-readonly-parameter-type` populated by the previous
sweep:
 3m04.7s wall,
 2m36.8s user,
 30.0s system.
The cache is 45 MB.

Cold runs of the same command through this session,
 with that cache deleted first:
 10m24s to
11m10s across eight measurements,
 clustering near 10m45s.

So the persistent summary cache removes roughly seventy per cent of the work,
 and the warm
figure is about three times the target rather than the eleven times a cold number implies.

Findings are identical between the warm and cold runs,
 1555 in both,
 with the same error and
warning totals.
That matters before trusting any timing:
 a cache that changed results would make the fast number
meaningless,
 and this one does not.

## Which three minutes

Measured by turning the one rule off in `oxlint.config.ts`,
 keeping the same task, invocation
and warm cache,
 and putting the file back afterwards.

Warm run with `prefer-readonly-parameter-type/prefer-readonly-parameter-types` disabled:
**13.0s** wall,
 against 3m04.7s with it on,
 and zero findings from it confirming it really was
off.

So this rule is about 171 of the 184 seconds,
 roughly ninety-three per cent of warm whole-repo
lint time.
Everything else oxlint does across the repository,
 core passes and every other plugin together,
is thirteen seconds.

That reframes issue #374 entirely.
The target is not a broad performance problem to chase across the linter;
 it is one rule,
 and
the rest of the run already sits comfortably inside sixty seconds with two thirds of the budget
to spare.
Reaching the target means taking this rule from 171 seconds to about 47,
 a factor of three and
a half,
 with no other component needing to change.

## What this does not yet say

### How to measure the next split, and what tripped

`EffectAnalysisBudget` in
`package/oxlint-plugin/prefer-readonly-parameter-type/src/prefer-readonly-parameter-types/effect-analysis-budget.ts`
already receives every timed span through `record({ startedAt, phase, },)`,
 and already knows
the phase label.
It accumulates only a single total,
 so the breakdown needs a temporary map keyed by the first
word of the label plus a dump on process exit.
That instrumentation type-checks and is the shortest path to the answer.

What tripped is the harness rather than the method:
 the run takes about three minutes and a
foreground command is cut off at two,
 which killed the workers before the exit handler wrote
anything and left the instrumented file in place until it was restored deliberately.
Run it in the background.

Only five sites report a phase at present,
 so the breakdown will account for part of the 171
seconds rather than all of it,
 and the size of the unaccounted remainder is itself the useful
number:
 it says how much sits outside every span the rule currently times.

### Which phase, measured

Warm run with per-phase accumulation,
 summed across every worker:

- `source` 583.3s
- `project` 23.4s
- `fixed-point` 4.5s
- `foreign` 0.8s
- 611.9s recorded in total

Two cautions before reading anything into those,
 both of which change what the numbers mean.

The total exceeds the rule's 171 seconds of wall time because the sweep runs workers in
parallel and each contributes its own spans,
 so these are worker-seconds and only their
*proportions* are meaningful.
And only five sites report a phase,
 so 611.9 worker-seconds is the total of instrumented spans
rather than of the rule's work;
 what falls outside them cannot be derived from this,
 because
wall time and summed time are not comparable under parallelism.

Within what is instrumented,
 `source` is 95.3 per cent and nothing else is close.

That is the phase to look at next,
 and the sharper question it raises is why it costs so much on
a *warm* cache:
 the cache exists to avoid re-deriving summaries,
 and a source phase still
dominating afterwards suggests either that it covers work the cache does not cover,
 or that
reuse is missing more often than intended.
Answering that needs the phase broken down further rather than another total.

### What the earlier suspects were


The suspects are the whole-program summary construction,
 the checker queries each summary
makes,
 and the per-file diagnostic pass,
 and nothing here separates them.

Nor does it say what the cache is worth per phase.
Cold costs 645 seconds against 184 warm,
 so 461 seconds are avoided by reuse,
 but whether the
remaining 171 is mostly unavoidable analysis or mostly cache misses is unmeasured.

## Why the cold number was the one being quoted

Every sweep in `doc/planning/prefer-readonly-return-substitution.md` deletes the cache first,
deliberately:
 a warm cache masked an analysis-internal failure earlier in that work,
 and the
guarded failure there is a wrong offer rather than a slow run.

Correct for that purpose and misleading for this one.
Anyone reading those eleven-minute figures as the cost of linting this repository would
conclude the target is an order of magnitude away.
It is closer to three times,
 and the first question is which three minutes.

### Why `source` costs so much warm, measured and then doubted

Instrumented the hit and miss branches inside `loadSource` and ran the warm sweep:
 4899 calls,
2584 hits and 2315 misses,
 a 47.3 per cent miss rate on an unchanged repository.

That would answer the question cleanly.
Nearly half of all source loads redo semantic analysis despite a populated cache,
 which is
where the seconds would be.

It is not safe to report yet,
 and the reason is the instrumentation itself.
Measuring required editing `effect-demand-index.ts`,
 which is plugin source.
If the layered summary cache keys on plugin identity or content in any way,
 then editing the
plugin invalidated every entry and the miss rate is an artifact of the act of measuring rather
than a property of the rule.

A quick search for a plugin version or hash in the cache key found nothing,
 which is weak
evidence against the confound and not enough:
 absence of a match for the names guessed is not
absence of the mechanism.

To settle it,
 either read `layered-summary-cache` and establish exactly what the key contains,
or measure without touching plugin source,
 for instance by counting from the cache directory's
own contents across two consecutive unmodified runs.
Until one of those is done the 47.3 per cent should be treated as unmeasured.

This is the same failure this repository's `QPC` and `QIV` rules were written for,
 reached
from a new direction:
 not an instrument that could not see a difference,
 but one that created
the difference it then reported.

#### Settled: the miss rate was an artifact

Read the key rather than guessing at its field names.

`effect-summaries.ts` builds
`projectDigest = contentDigest(`${projectFingerprint.digest}\0${analysisRoot ?? ''}`,)`,
 and
`effect-summary-cache.ts` stores each entry under that digest together with the file's own
`sourceText`.

Both halves are reached by editing a plugin file.
The plugin's own sources sit in the workspace this command lints,
 so changing
`effect-demand-index.ts` changes that file's `sourceText` directly and feeds a project-level
fingerprint that is not per-file.

So the 47.3 per cent miss rate measured the cost of having just edited the analyzer,
 not the
cost of running it.
Withdrawn.

The earlier search for a plugin version or hash found nothing and was read as weak evidence
*against* the confound.
It was evidence of nothing:
 the mechanism is there under names that describe the project
rather than the plugin,
 and the plugin is part of the project.
Guessing field names is not reading a key.

What remains true and unaffected:
 the warm run is 3m04.7s,
 the rule is ninety-three per cent
of it,
 and `source` is ninety-five per cent of instrumented spans.
Those came from runs with no plugin edit in place.

Measuring the warm miss rate needs a method that touches no plugin source,
 such as reading the
cache directory's own contents across two consecutive unmodified runs.

#### Measured without touching the plugin: the cache is not the problem

Two consecutive `mise run lint:oxlint` runs with the working tree clean,
 comparing the cache
directory's own contents by path, modification time and size.

- 4104 entries after the first run,
 4124 after the second
- 4095 identical across both
- 29 rewritten or added

A hit does not rewrite its entry,
 so 29 of 4124 is an upper bound on misses:
 about 0.7 per
cent,
 and lower still if any of those rewrites are ordinary bookkeeping rather than
recomputation.

That refutes the withdrawn 47.3 per cent outright,
 by a method with no plugin edit anywhere
near it.
Cache reuse on an unchanged repository is essentially complete.

So the 171 seconds are not cache misses,
 and improving the hit rate is the wrong target.
The time is spent on work that happens *despite* hits:
 candidates are the cache read and
validation path itself,
 which runs for every one of those 4000-odd entries,
 and whatever
per-source work sits inside the `source` span outside `loadSource`'s cached branch.

That is the next thing to separate,
 and the method is now established:
 measure from outside the
plugin,
 or accept that any edit to it invalidates what is being measured.

#### The cache read is not it either

Bounded from outside the plugin,
 by a standalone script reading and parsing every file in the
cache directory:
 4124 files,
 71.1 MB,
 **0.26s** single-threaded,
 with all 4124 parsing as JSON.

So deserialising the entire cache costs a quarter of a second against 171 seconds of rule time.
The read and validate path is eliminated as the explanation,
 and with cache misses already
eliminated at 0.7 per cent,
 both candidates named in the previous section are gone.

One number worth carrying to whoever continues:
 the confounded run counted 4899 `loadSource`
calls against 4124 cache files on disk.
If that call count survives re-measurement by an uncontaminated method,
 then roughly 775 loads,
about sixteen per cent,
 have no cache entry to hit at all,
 and full analysis of those would be
a candidate the phase labels do not currently distinguish from cached ones.
It is a lead rather than a finding,
 since its source is the run that was withdrawn.

What is established for issue #374,
 all of it from runs with no plugin edit in place:
 warm is
3m04.7s,
 the rule is ninety-three per cent of it,
 `source` is ninety-five per cent of
instrumented spans,
 cache reuse is essentially complete,
 and reading the cache is free.
The remaining time is per-source work done despite hits,
 and separating it needs instrumentation
inside the plugin,
 which is precisely what the cache key makes self-defeating.
Resolving that tension is the first problem for whoever takes this further,
 not the profiling.

#### The tension resolves by running the instrumented build twice

The obstacle was that instrumenting the plugin changes the cache key,
 so a probe measures its
own edit.
The fix needs no cleverness:
 run the instrumented build twice.
The first run repopulates the cache under the new fingerprint and the second is genuinely warm
relative to that code,
 with the counters differing from production only by two integers.

- Run A,
 repopulating:
 4778 calls,
 51.5 per cent hits,
 48.5 per cent misses
- Run B,
 warm:
 4764 calls,
 **100.0 per cent hits,
 zero misses**

Run A reproduces the withdrawn 47.3 per cent almost exactly,
 which confirms what that number
was:
 the cost of repopulating after an edit,
 measured once and mistaken for steady state.

Run B is the answer.
Every single one of 4764 source loads hits,
 and the run still takes 2m49s.

So the rule's warm cost is entirely work done *despite* a perfect hit rate.
With deserialising the whole cache measured at 0.26s,
 it is not reading the entries either.
Whatever `loadSource` does with a hit beyond reading it,
 validation and reconstruction being
the obvious candidates,
 or work in the `source` span outside `loadSource` altogether,
 is where
the 171 seconds are.

That is a much smaller haystack than this section started with,
 and the method for searching it
is now established rather than blocked.

#### Withdrawn too: `source` is not ninety-five per cent

The phase split recorded earlier came from a single instrumented run,
 which is the same
mistake as the miss rate and was not noticed at the time.
Re-measured with the two-run method:

- Run A,
 repopulating:
 `source` 595.0s (95.7 per cent),
 `project` 21.2s,
 `fixed-point` 4.6s,
`foreign` 0.8s
- Run B,
 warm:
 `project` 21.8s (87.3 per cent),
 `source` **2.0s** (8.0 per cent),
 `foreign`
0.8s,
 `fixed-point` 0.4s

Run A reproduces the withdrawn 95.3 per cent,
 confirming its origin.
Warm,
 `source` is two worker-seconds,
 not five hundred and eighty-three,
 and the phase that
led every earlier conclusion in this document leads nothing.

The larger fact is the total.
Warm,
 every instrumented span in the rule sums to **25.0 worker-seconds** while the rule takes
about 169 seconds of wall time,
 across workers that together have far more than 25 seconds of
work to do.

So the rule's own phase instrumentation accounts for almost none of its warm cost.
The time is outside every span the analyzer currently times,
 which points at the per-file
diagnostic pass or setup that no `record` call wraps,
 rather than at anything measured so far.

That is where the search should start,
 and it is not where any earlier section of this document
pointed.

#### What survives, and what does not

Sound:
 warm total 3m04.7s,
 ninety-three per cent of it attributable to this rule by disabling
it,
 cache hit rate 100 per cent warm,
 cache deserialisation 0.26s.
Each came from runs whose instrumentation could not affect what they measured.

Withdrawn:
 the 47.3 per cent miss rate,
 and the ninety-five per cent `source` share.
Both came from single instrumented runs and both are now explained rather than merely
replaced,
 which is the only reason to trust the corrections more than the originals.

Two of the five substantive numbers in this document were wrong in the same way,
 and the second
survived a reading pass that was looking for exactly that fault.

#### Where to instrument next, and the shape the edit must take

The target is the rule's per-file entry:
 `Program` in
`package/oxlint-plugin/prefer-readonly-parameter-type/src/prefer-readonly-parameter-types.ts`,
which opens a semantic file session inside a `try` and is wrapped by no `record` call.
Timing entry to exit there,
 summed and compared against the rule's 169 warm seconds,
 says
directly whether the unaccounted time is inside the rule body or in setup around it.

An attempt at that edit failed and is worth describing so the next one does not repeat it.
The visitor's body is a single `try` whose `catch` uses a logger bound above it,
 so splicing a
timing `try` around the outside by text substitution detaches that binding and the file stops
compiling with `Cannot find name 'rl'`.
The edit needs to add accounting *inside* the existing `try` and a `finally`,
 not wrap it.

Run it with the two-run method like everything else here,
 and read run B only.

The three cautions this document has earned,
 in the order they bit:

1. Instrumenting the plugin changes the cache key,
 because the key derives from a
project-level fingerprint and the plugin's sources are in the linted workspace.
Run twice and read the second run.
2. Recorded spans are summed across parallel workers,
 so they exceed wall time and only
proportions are comparable.
3. The rule's own phase labels cover a small fraction of its warm work,
 so a breakdown of them
is not a breakdown of the rule.

#### Found: the time is inside `Program`, outside every phase span

Instrumented the per-file entry as described,
 accounting inside the existing `try` with a
`finally`,
 and run twice.

- Run A,
 repopulating:
 636.7 worker-seconds across 2080 file visits,
 306.1ms per file
- Run B,
 warm:
 **172.3 worker-seconds across 2080 file visits,
 82.8ms per file**

The rule contributes about 171 seconds to the warm wall time,
 and `Program` accounts for 172.3
worker-seconds of it,
 so the per-file visitor is essentially the whole cost rather than a part
of it.

Set that against the 25.0 worker-seconds all instrumented phases sum to,
 and roughly **147
worker-seconds,
 about eighty-five per cent,
 sits inside `Program` and outside every span the
analyzer times.**

That is the answer this section has been circling.
The warm cost is not summary construction,
 not cache misses,
 not reading the cache,
 and not
any labelled phase.
It is the per-file work that happens after `buildEffectSummaryIndex` returns:
 opening the
semantic file session,
 and verifying each callable to decide what to report.

Eighty-three milliseconds per file across 2080 files is the shape of the target,
 and the
repopulating figure of 306ms per file gives the contrast:
 even with every summary already
built,
 each file still costs a quarter of what a full analysis costs.

Whoever optimizes this should start by splitting those 82.8ms between session opening and
per-callable verification,
 which is one more `finally` in the same visitor and the same two-run
method.

#### The split: index construction dominates even at a perfect hit rate

Same visitor,
 accounting around `openSemanticFile` and `buildEffectSummaryIndex` with the
remainder attributed to verification,
 run twice.

Run B,
 warm,
 172.1 worker-seconds across 2080 files:

- `buildEffectSummaryIndex` **104.0s,
 60.4 per cent,
 50.0ms per file**
- verification of callables 56.5s,
 32.8 per cent,
 27.2ms per file
- `openSemanticFile` 11.5s,
 6.7 per cent,
 5.5ms per file

Run A,
 repopulating,
 for contrast:
 546.6s index,
 54.3s verification,
 11.0s session.

Two things follow.

The index build is the target.
It costs 104 warm seconds *with every summary a cache hit*,
 down from 546 when they are not,
so the cache already removes eighty-one per cent of it and fifty milliseconds per file remain
regardless.
That residue is per-file index construction rather than analysis:
 assembling and wiring an
index from summaries already in hand.

And it reconciles the earlier finding.
Instrumented phases sum to 25.0 warm worker-seconds while `buildEffectSummaryIndex` alone takes
104.0,
 so roughly seventy-nine seconds are spent inside that call in code no `record` wraps.
The untimed eighty-five per cent is not scattered:
 it is nearly all inside index construction.

Verification is second at 27.2ms per file and worth knowing about,
 since it barely moves
between the two runs,
 11.0s against 11.5s for the session and 54.3s against 56.5s for
verification.
Both are insensitive to the cache,
 which is expected:
 they work from the index rather than
building it.

#### Reaching sixty seconds

The rule must go from about 171 seconds to about 47 for the whole command to fit the target.
Removing index construction entirely would leave roughly 68 warm seconds of rule time,
 which is
still over.
So the target is not reachable by fixing one of these three alone,
 and any plan for #374 has to
say which combination it intends.

#### The index is reused; deciding whether to reuse it is what costs

`buildEffectSummaryIndex` does hold a whole-index cache,
 `cachedFinalEffectIndex`,
 with an
early return.
So the index is not simply rebuilt per file.
Measured warm,
 across 2080 calls:

- final-index hits **64.4 per cent**,
 1340 of 2080
- work performed *before* the cache check:
 **63.8 worker-seconds,
 30.7ms per call**

That is 61 per cent of the 104 warm seconds spent deciding whether the cached index applies,
paid on every file whether it hits or not.

The pre-check work is the key computation itself:
 collecting file names,
 building
`indexedSourceFileMap`,
 then `contentDigest` over every indexed file name sorted and joined.
The digest is over the whole file list,
 so its cost scales with project size and is repeated
once per linted file:
 2080 files each hashing a list of some four thousand names.

So the answer to "is the index rebuilt per file" is no,
 and the useful finding is the one
underneath it:
 a cache whose lookup costs 30.7ms cannot pay for itself at this call frequency,
and roughly 64 of the 171 warm seconds are spent on cache administration rather than on
analysis or on reporting.

The remaining 35.6 per cent of calls miss and build the index fully,
 which is the other half of
the 104 seconds.

Two independent directions follow,
 and both are now grounded rather than guessed:
 make the
key cheaper,
 since the file list does not change within a run and its digest could be computed
once per worker;
 or raise the hit rate above 64 per cent,
 since a third of calls still rebuild.
The first looks like the larger and safer win,
 and neither has been attempted.

#### What a cheaper key has to respect

The obvious fix,
 computing the file-list digest once per worker,
 is not sound as stated,
 and
the reason is worth recording before anyone writes it.

`fileNames` is the program's source file names *plus* `activeSourceFile.fileName`,
 sorted.
The digest is then taken over `indexedSourceFiles.keys()`,
 which is that list after
`indexedSourceFileMap` applies the ownership policy,
 not over `fileNames` directly.

So the digest is genuinely per-active-file in general,
 and memoising it on the project key
alone would reuse an index built for a different inclusion scope.
That is a wrong-index bug rather than a slow one,
 in a rule whose failure mode is a wrong
read-only offer.

What makes the optimisation plausible anyway is that the active file is almost always already
in `project.program.getSourceFileNames()`,
 so adding it changes nothing and the sorted list is
identical across every file of that project.
That is also why the final-index cache hits 64.4 per cent rather than never.

A sound version therefore needs a condition,
 something like:
 reuse the memoised digest only
when the active file was already among the program's names *and* the ownership filter's result
does not depend on which file is active.
The second half is the part to establish rather than assume,
 by reading `indexedSourceFileMap`.

Not implemented here.
The finding is sound and the fix is not yet safe to write,
 and the gap between those two is
where this session's errors have consistently lived.

#### The filter does not depend on the active file, so the memo is sound

Read `indexedSourceFileMap` rather than assuming,
 since this was the blocking unknown.

For every file *other* than the active one the result is independent of which file is active.
`activeSourceFile` appears twice and both uses concern that file alone:
 once to substitute the
Oxlint overlay for its own entry,
 and once to include it unconditionally,
 ahead of the
declaration-file test,
 the project checks,
 `isWorkspaceSourceFileName` and the `analysisRoot`
prefix.

So the key set is exactly:
 the ownership-filtered set,
 which is a property of the project,
union the active file.

That yields a sound design rather than a hopeful one.
Memoise the *filtered map* per project key,
 not the digest,
 because building the map is the
expensive part:
 a `flatMap` over some four thousand names,
 repeated for each of 2080 files.
Then per call,
 test whether the active file is already in the memoised set,
 which is O(1).
When it is,
 and it usually is for workspace sources since `isWorkspaceSourceFileName` admits
them,
 the digest is the memoised one and nothing is recomputed.
When it is not,
 digest the union,
 which is the rare path.

That removes most of the 63.8 warm worker-seconds now spent before the cache check,
 without
changing which index is selected for any file:
 the set it keys on is identical either way,
 by
the argument above rather than by measurement.

Still not implemented,
 and the remaining risk is no longer soundness but placement:
 the memo
must be keyed on something that cannot outlive the project it describes,
 and picking that key
wrongly is the same wrong-index bug by another route.

#### Placement is settled by precedent, so the fix is fully specified

The last stated risk was where to keep the memo without it outliving the project it describes.
`effect-final-index-cache.ts` already answers that:
 `finalIndexesByProject` is a process-level
`Map` keyed on the project *object*,
 then partitioned by `projectKey`.
Project identity bounds the entry,
 since a new semantic snapshot is a new project and reaches
none of the old entries.

The filtered-map memo belongs in exactly that shape,
 keyed the same way and living beside it.
Nothing new has to be decided about lifetime,
 and following the existing structure is also what
keeps a fourth caching layer from acquiring a fourth invalidation story.

So the change is now fully specified:

1. Memoise the ownership-filtered map per project object and `projectKey`,
 beside
`finalIndexesByProject`.
2. Per call,
 test whether the active file is in the memoised set;
 reuse its digest when it is
and digest the union when it is not.
3. Sound because the filter is active-file independent,
 which
"The filter does not depend on the active file" establishes by reading it.
4. Expected to remove most of 63.8 warm worker-seconds,
 which is the measured cost of the work
before the cache check.

What remains is writing and verifying it,
 which means the unit suite,
 the two-run timing to
confirm the saving,
 and a full sweep to confirm the diagnostic set is byte-identical,
 since a
wrong-index bug would show there as changed findings rather than as a slow run.

### Landed: deriving the inclusion scope once per project

Implemented as specified,
 and measured.

Warm whole-repo lint **2m22.4s against 3m04.7s**,
 saving 42 seconds,
 twenty-three per cent of
the command.
That tracks the prediction:
 30.7ms per call across 2080 calls is about 64 worker-seconds of key
derivation,
 most of which is skipped once the scope is reused.

Findings and offers are **byte-identical**,
 1555 and 35,
 matching the sweep before the change.
That is the test that mattered.
The failure mode for this optimisation is selecting an index built for a different inclusion
scope,
 which produces wrong diagnostics rather than a slow run,
 so the unit suite passing was
never sufficient on its own.

Two details decided whether it was safe,
 and both are in the code's own comments rather than
only here.
Only the key set and digest are stored,
 never the map,
 because the map's values hold the overlay
`SourceFile` of whichever run built it.
And the store is keyed on the project object,
 as `effect-final-index-cache.ts` keys its own,
 so
a new semantic snapshot reaches none of the entries.

#### What is left for #374

Warm is 2m22s against a sixty-second target,
 so 2.4 times over rather than 3.
The attribution says the rest is verification,
 around 56.5 warm seconds,
 and the 35.6 per cent
of index calls that still miss and rebuild.
Neither has been attempted,
 and the arithmetic recorded in "Reaching sixty seconds" still
holds:
 no single remaining component closes the gap alone.

### The remaining derivations are first-touch, not scope mismatches

Instrumented the memo after it landed,
 warm,
 2080 calls:

- scope memo present:
 1358,
 65.3 per cent
- active file already in that scope:
 **1358**,
 the same number
- final index hit on it:
 1356
- full derivation still needed:
 724,
 34.8 per cent

The middle two being identical is the result.
Whenever a scope has been derived for a project partition,
 the active file is in it every
single time,
 so the case the memo declines to cover,
 an active file outside the project's
filtered set,
 does not arise in this repository at all.

The 724 remaining derivations are therefore first touches:
 calls where no scope exists yet for
that partition.
Their number is a property of how work is distributed rather than of the cache,
 since each
worker holds its own module state and must derive once per project it is handed.
Two thousand and eighty files across some hundreds of package partitions and several workers
gives roughly that count.

So the memo has reached its ceiling as designed.
Sixty-five per cent is not a hit rate to be improved by better keying;
 it is one derivation per
worker per project,
 and the only ways below it are fewer partitions per worker or state shared
between workers,
 which are scheduling questions rather than caching ones.

That also revises what "the 35.6 per cent of index calls that still miss" meant in
"Reaching sixty seconds".
Those misses are not repeated work on the same scope.
They are the irreducible first derivation for each partition a worker sees,
 and closing them
means changing how oxlint distributes files,
 which is outside this rule.

### The last component is productive work, not overhead

Split the verification pass,
 warm,
 2076 files and 667608 collected AST nodes:

- `collectAstNodes` **0.0s**,
 0.0ms per file
- `verifyReadonlyCallable` **40.3s**,
 19.4ms per file

The walk is free.
Collecting two thirds of a million nodes costs nothing measurable,
 because they are already
materialised by the time this asks for them.
That eliminates the one candidate here that would have been cheap to fix.

What remains is the rule deciding what to report,
 nineteen milliseconds per file,
 and it is
the first component measured in this document that is not overhead.
The index key derivation was pure waste and was removed.
The remaining index derivations are a scheduling artefact.
The walk is free.
Verification is the analysis itself:
 building each parameter's facts and demanding the proofs
before emitting anything.

So the attribution is complete,
 and it ends somewhere different from where it started.
There is no further waste to remove inside this rule.
Going faster from here means computing less,
 which means deciding what the rule may stop
proving,
 and that is a correctness conversation rather than a performance one.

Warm now stands at 2m22s against a sixty-second target.
Verification at roughly 40 seconds and the per-worker first derivations are what remain,
 and
neither yields to a cache.

### Correction: "productive work" was an inference, and it reopened

The previous section concluded there was no waste left inside this rule.
That was reached from where verification sits in the call tree,
 not from measuring inside it,
which is the same fault as the two withdrawn figures wearing different clothes:
 a conclusion
about a component nobody had opened.

Split it,
 warm,
 8337 callables:

- `readonlyParameterFacts` **35.0s,
 4.2ms per callable**,
 ninety-three per cent of verification
- reporting decisions 2.7s,
 0.33ms per callable

Four point two milliseconds inside one function,
 per callable,
 is not self-evidently
irreducible.
It is where parameter types are classified,
 and type classification across a codebase repeats
enormously:
 the same `Row`,
 the same `readonly string[]`,
 the same `AbortSignal`,
 resolved
again for every callable that mentions them.

So the conclusion that reaching sixty seconds requires computing less is withdrawn as premature.
It may still be true.
It is not established,
 and the obvious thing to establish first is whether classification
results are being recomputed for types already seen,
 which would be waste of exactly the kind
already removed once from the index key.

The lever to try is memoisation keyed on type identity,
 and the measurement to take first is
how often the same type is classified more than once.
Neither has been attempted.

That this section exists is the finding worth keeping.
The attribution was declared complete three times before it was,
 each time because a component
was classified by its position rather than by opening it.

### The repeat is visible in the source: the classifier memo is per-call

No measurement needed for the first half of the question.
`classifyReadonlyType` in
`package/oxlint-plugin/prefer-readonly-parameter-type/src/prefer-readonly-parameter-types/readonly-classifier.ts`
opens with:

```ts
const memo = new Map<number, ReadonlyClassification | typeof CLASSIFICATION_ACTIVE>();
```

A fresh map per call.
It is keyed by semantic type ID and does its job within one traversal,
 which is cycle handling
for a recursive walk,
 and it retains nothing between calls.

So every parameter re-classifies its whole type graph from scratch.
A `Row` mentioned by two hundred callables is walked two hundred times,
 and each walk redoes
every nested property,
 element and signature beneath it.
That is consistent with 4.2ms per callable in `readonlyParameterFacts`,
 and it is waste of the
same kind already removed from the index key:
 a memo whose scope is narrower than the
repetition it faces.

The lever is therefore to widen that memo's lifetime rather than to compute less.

What has to hold for it to be safe,
 and what to check before writing it:

1. Type IDs are stable only within one checker or project instance,
 so the shared store must be
keyed on that, as `effect-final-index-cache.ts` and the inclusion-scope memo already are.
2. `CLASSIFICATION_ACTIVE` is a traversal marker,
 not a result,
 and must never be published to
a later call.
3. Whatever the classification depends on besides the type itself must be part of the key.
`classifyReadonlyType` takes `checker` and `project` alongside `type`,
 and whether the result
can differ for one type across those is the thing to establish by reading rather than assuming,
because getting it wrong returns a classification from a different semantic world.

Point three is the one that decides it,
 and it is exactly the shape of the question that made
the inclusion-scope memo safe:
 does the result depend on anything but the key.

#### Point three holds: the classification depends on nothing but the type

Read rather than assumed,
 since this was the deciding condition.

Every use of `checker` and `project` inside `classifyReadonlyType` is derived from the type
being classified:
 `handle.resolve(project,)` on that type's own declaration handle,
`checker.getBaseConstraintOfType(current,)`,
 `checker.isArrayType(current,)`,
`checker.getTypeArguments(current,)`.
None consults anything outside the type.

So the classification is a pure function of the type,
 computed through the checker that owns
it.
Type IDs are meaningful only within one checker instance,
 and that is the same boundary the
result is valid within,
 so keying a shared store on the project and the type ID is exactly
right:
 within that scope the answer depends on nothing else,
 and outside it the key cannot
collide because the store does not span instances.

All three conditions are therefore satisfied,
 and widening the memo is sound.
`CLASSIFICATION_ACTIVE` still must not escape:
 it means "this traversal is currently below
this type",
 which is true of a traversal rather than of a type,
 so only settled results may be
published.

### Landed: sharing settled classifications per project

Warm whole-repo lint **1m50.7s against 2m22.4s**,
 another 32 seconds.
Findings and offers byte-identical at 1555 and 35.

Cumulative across both changes:
 **3m04.7s to 1m50.7s,
 a forty per cent reduction**,
 with the
diagnostic set unchanged throughout.

The byte-identical sweep is what confirms it rather than the unit suite.
A classification leaking across semantic worlds would surface as changed diagnostics,
 not as a
fast run,
 which is the same reason the inclusion-scope memo was gated on a sweep.

#### What this cost to find

Two sections of this document concluded there was no waste left,
 and both were wrong the same
way:
 a component classified by its position in the call tree rather than by opening it.
The second of those was written after the first had been withdrawn for exactly that fault.

The finding needed no measurement in the end.
`classifyReadonlyType` builds its memo per call,
 which is visible on the line that declares it,
and the repetition it faces is a property of any codebase that names a type more than once.
What the measurements bought was knowing which function to open,
 which was worth having;
 what
they could not do was substitute for opening it.

### Re-measured after both changes

Warm,
 2076 files:

- `buildEffectSummaryIndex` **76.0s**,
 36.6ms per file,
 from 104.0s
- verification **13.3s**,
 6.4ms per file,
 from 56.5s

Verification fell by seventy-six per cent,
 which is the shared classification memo doing what it
was written for and confirms the mechanism rather than merely the wall clock.

The rule now spends about 89 warm seconds against roughly 171 before,
 and index construction is
once again the dominant component at eighty-five per cent of it.

That returns to the 724 first-touch derivations.
At 76 seconds across 724 of them the arithmetic is about 105ms each,
 which accounts for
essentially the whole remaining index cost:
 what is left is not repeated work but the first
derivation for each project a worker is handed.

So the two levers already established are the only ones the measurements point at,
 and neither
is a cache:
 make a single derivation cheaper,
 or reduce how many worker-project pairs exist.
The second is oxlint's file distribution rather than this rule.

Warm now stands at 1m50.7s against a sixty-second target.

### A probe inside the derivation produced nothing, cause unknown

Attempted the split inside a single derivation,
 timing the scope and digest work,
 the project
fingerprint,
 and the demand index with its propagation.
It type-checked,
 both runs completed,
 and **no probe output was written at all**.

That is not a null result about the code.
It is a broken instrument,
 and the difference matters:
 724 derivations occur per run,
 so the
counters should have fired hundreds of times.

Not diagnosed.
The likely candidates are the closing timer being anchored on a `return index;` that is not the
path taken,
 or the exit hook never registering on the branch that runs.
Recorded rather than retried because guessing at a second instrument to check the first is how
this document acquired four withdrawn figures.

The tree was restored and verified clean,
 and the unit suite passes,
 so nothing is left behind.

What stands unmeasured as a result:
 the composition of a single derivation,
 currently
estimated at about 105ms from 76 seconds across 724 of them.
That estimate is arithmetic over a total,
 not an observation of one derivation,
 and by the
standard this document has had to adopt twice it should not be trusted until something opens
one successfully.

#### Diagnosed: the probe registered its writer on the path it was measuring

Tested by writing unconditionally at the miss path instead of on exit.
On a single-file lint the miss path executed **zero** times,
 the final index being already
cached.

That is the fault.
The failed probe registered its `process.on('exit')` writer inside the miss path,
 so any
process that never misses never registers a writer and never writes,
 whatever it accumulated.
The three probes that worked in this same file all registered at a path every call reaches.

The instrument's registration was conditional on the thing it was measuring,
 which is the same
shape as everything else this document has had to withdraw,
 and it produced silence rather than
a wrong number.
Silence was the lucky outcome:
 a partial registration across workers would have written a
plausible total from whichever processes happened to miss.

The fix is to register the writer at function entry,
 unconditionally,
 and accumulate only on
the miss path.

Whether that alone explains it is not established.
`process.on('exit')` in a worker thread is not the same as in a process,
 and how oxlint hosts
JS plugins was never checked here.
The three successful probes prove writers can fire at all,
 so at minimum the registration
placement is necessary;
 whether it is sufficient wants the retry rather than an argument.
