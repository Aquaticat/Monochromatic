# cli-git Rust rewrite scope

## Status and authority

The user clarified that the Rust rewrite is already decided
and directed the session away from unnecessary evaluation.
The original rewrite-versus-retain question is closed.
Do not require comparative benchmarks or a new language-selection audit to reopen it.

The main agent over-investigated the original decision after the direction was sufficiently settled.
The remaining interview is limited to implementation-changing scope questions,
followed by confirmation of shared understanding before implementation.
No production source changes have been made.

Proposed instruction refinement for `AGENTS.md`:
explicitly stop comparative evaluation after a user settles the choice;
retain only investigation that can change implementation,
safety,
or acceptance.

## Current evidence

- `package/git-policy/cli/package.json` exposes both a shadowing `git` executable and a policy-authoring import.
  The runtime range is `^24.11.0 || ^26.0.0`.
- `package/git-policy/cli/src/index.ts` exports the authoring API and runs the executable only for direct execution.
- `cli-git.config.ts` registers repository,
  forbidden-strings,
  and Markdown plugins.
  Its forbidden-strings command uses the Rust scanner executable;
  its Markdown command invokes Node.
  Rewriting the wrapper alone does not decide the runtime requirements of those consumers.
- `doc/decision/cli-git-policies-platform.md`,
  "Decision",
  "Goals",
  and "Non-goals",
  accepts trusted executable repository configuration and a pluggable policy platform.
  Working without mise is required;
  working without Node is not the same requirement.
  Registry publication is deferred,
  not replaced by an accepted native-binary distribution plan.
- `doc/decision/cli-git-concurrent-commits.md` describes private preparation,
  shadow repositories,
  compare-and-swap landing,
  replay,
  and recovery.
  A language evaluation must inventory these semantics rather than treating the package as argument forwarding alone.
- `package/git-policy/cli/SPEC.md`,
  "Benchmark method",
  defines paired real-Git baselines and separate lifecycle scenarios.
  Existing recorded results are historical evidence,
  not a fresh baseline or evidence of a Rust rewrite's effect.
- `doc/decision/monorepo-manager-all-rust.md`,
  "Status" and "Context",
  scopes its all-Rust approval to that tool and records a single-file distribution requirement.
  That requirement must not silently transfer to cli-git.

## Settled interview requirements

### Performance

The user wants faster execution throughout cli-git,
not only faster startup.
The reported experience is that a commit might take 20 seconds.
This is a reported symptom,
not an agent measurement or an attributed bottleneck.
The user then supplied a concrete observation:
staging `doc/planning/slint-ide-0x.md`,
then committing that explicit path with message `docs(planning): fix scope interview semantic line breaks`,
took 8.9 seconds in the command harness.
This is combined staging and commit elapsed time,
not an isolated commit-phase measurement.
Real Git confirms commit `c37f58ca54c197cc98bddeb37562b30d10967331` changed that Markdown file
with 10 insertions and 5 deletions.
The sample establishes an end-to-end workload to investigate,
not its cause.

No numeric acceptance budget is settled for the new design.
The incumbent benchmark already defines wrapper-added budgets in
`package/git-policy/cli/perf/lifecycle-latency-contracts.ts`,
including a 2,000 ms upper ceiling and a 1,150 ms post-commit scenario budget.
Those are synthetic-fixture overhead budgets,
not a promise that this repository's entire add/commit/push operation finishes within those times.

### Language and runtime

The user answered yes to whether achieving the desired outcomes without a rewrite would satisfy them.
That first-round answer explained motivation,
not a reason to keep the language choice open after the later clarification.
Rust is now the selected implementation language.
Eliminating an external Node installation is not a hard requirement.

### Configuration

The user explicitly selected JSONC and removed the requirement to retain TypeScript support.
They identified the repository's recently ported Rust JSONC package for reuse.
Inspect that package before proposing another parser.
The user subsequently selected shipped policies only,
rejecting the proposed generic external-policy extension capability.
The user also wants the executable-config trust subsystem removed.
A broad enough built-in catalog to avoid writing new policies is a 2.x goal.
The user confirmed the release split:
current required coverage comes first;
the expanded catalog is out of scope for this session.

The user's Q7 answer is read literally as yes to allowing repository JSONC to weaken enforcement:
policy disabling and exclusions take effect without consent.
The proposed personal non-overridable policy minimum is not selected.
Do not introduce a replacement trust registry or global policy layer.

Existing built-in adapters accept executable paths and command arrays:
`package/git-policy/markdown-lint/src/index.ts` defines `command`,
and `package/git-policy/forbidden-strings/src/index.ts` defines `executable`.
The generated copies under `package/git-policy/cli/src/optional/` retain these options.
The shipped-only design must not preserve arbitrary program selection through JSONC;
that would retain the executable-config problem under a different name.
Deleting the trust subsystem does not remove the need to validate data,
or constrain file writes.
Repository-controlled policy settings are an accepted product behavior,
not a code-execution authorization mechanism.

### Embedding

The user clarified:
"cli-git should come with forbidden-strings bundled in."
Cli-git is the distributing tool and forbidden-strings is bundled with it,
not the reverse.
Keep this product requirement distinct from selecting in-process linkage versus an owned child executable.
No scanner replacement is requested.

## Local interface inspection

- `package/rust-module/jsonc-edit/Cargo.toml` declares `monochromatic-jsonc-edit` 0.1.0 with no dependencies.
  `src/lib.rs` exports `parse_jsonc`,
  `emit_jsonc_value`,
  `parse_jsonc_edit`,
  and immutable editing operations.
  Reuse is explicitly requested;
  this interview has not rerun its tests.
- `package/cli/forbidden-strings/Cargo.toml` already defines both a library and an executable.
  `src/lib.rs` exposes rule compilation and `run_cli_from_env`,
  while scan orchestration modules remain private.
  A library target alone is not evidence that the desired embedding interface already exists.
- `node_modules/.bin/git` dispatches to the built `git-policy-cli` MJS artifact.
  The existing packed tarball and built artifact have different modification dates.
  Do not benchmark the tarball as the current installed wrapper without verifying artifact identity.

## Next preference frontier

The configuration-authority and release-scope questions are answered.
No new architecture question should be asked merely to repeat those choices.
Do not run more incumbent benchmarks to decide whether to rewrite.
Performance verification belongs to implementation acceptance,
not a prerequisite for the already selected language.
Do not propose backgrounding auto-push as a latency remedy before measuring it.
Preserve accepted safety,
concurrent-commit,
and recovery requirements unless the user explicitly reopens them;
rewriting is not permission to drop functionality.
The rejected alternative is a generic external-policy plugin interface.
Rust is selected.
No specific module arrangement or migration strategy has been implemented.

## Pending evidence and dependent questions

- Inventory implementation responsibilities,
  consumers,
  parallel systems,
  workarounds,
  suppressions,
  tests,
  and platform contracts before recommending a replacement.
- Measure a fresh incumbent baseline and unchanged-input variability for any performance claim.
  Separate wrapper startup,
  policy execution,
  Git subprocess work,
  locking,
  filesystem work,
  and remote latency.
- Freeze relevant hard constraints and criteria from the user's answers.
- Do not revisit retaining the incumbent as an alternative to the selected Rust rewrite.
- Decide scope,
  policy execution boundary,
  parity requirements,
  migration,
  and rollback only when prerequisite preferences are settled.
- Request explicit confirmation of shared understanding before implementation.

## Installed-wrapper baseline execution

A detached worktree under the private agent scratch directory,
`cli-git-rust-latency-20261004`,
contains a temporary `perf:installed-boundary` task in `package/git-policy/cli/mise.toml`.
No production sources are changed.

The task runs the existing lifecycle benchmark twice in fresh,
mount-free containers.
It copies the installed wrapper rather than the differently dated packed tarball.
Both original and copied `index.mjs` have SHA-256
`a418ca48f202850cbda6943efe8eaaad02488c16aad5d9e7321ea10af22894cd`.

The source Containerfile for the reused local image is
`package/git-policy/cli/e2e/concurrent-commits.Containerfile`.
The pinned local base image ID is
`1d29d429cddf5663ca721fc1f4bc2480c90e09694b3acacafc648e7638748910`.
The probe reuses its installed dependencies,
replaces the wrapper artifact,
and selects its Git 2.55.0 executable.
No dependency download runs.

Execution is bounded to 2 GiB RAM,
2 CPUs,
256 PIDs,
and the existing finite sample and fixture counts.
Network is disabled;
no real home,
credentials,
repository mount,
or external remote is available.
All fixtures,
trust records,
commits,
and pushes stay inside the disposable container.
The inspected benchmark uses a synthetic scanner,
a 2,048-file tree,
and local bare remotes.
It does not reproduce the live repository's Markdown policy,
real scanner workload,
GitHub transport,
or concurrent host commits.
It cannot establish or dismiss the cause of the reported 8.9 seconds.

Invocation:
`mise run //package/git-policy/cli:perf:installed-boundary` in the detached worktree.
Managed process:
`cli-git-installed-lifecycle-baseline`.
Status:
completed with exit 0.
Baseline-capture mode collects measurements without enforcing performance budgets;
exit 0 is not a budget-pass result.

Raw results:

- [`installed-baseline-run-1.json`](cli-git-rust-rewrite-evidence/installed-baseline-run-1.json).
- [`installed-baseline-run-2.json`](cli-git-rust-rewrite-evidence/installed-baseline-run-2.json).

Each scenario records 30 samples after 6 warm-ups in each run.
The installed artifact identity is its recorded SHA-256;
`revision: unrecorded` in the raw benchmark output must not be represented as a verified source revision.

One-file commit plus local auto-push had wrapper wall-time medians of 436.710 and 450.966 ms.
Its paired direct Git commit plus push medians were 27.035 and 27.509 ms.
Paired wrapper-added medians were 409.953 and 423.590 ms;
wrapper-added p95 values were 444.931 and 439.857 ms.
These figures measure the synthetic fixture,
not the reported Markdown workload.

Unchanged-run variability is material elsewhere:
the 256-path commit wrapper medians were 2,336.066 and 582.359 ms.
No implementation comparison has run,
and no causal explanation for that spread is established.
Do not attribute either the spread or the real-repository delay to Rust,
Node,
trust,
network,
or contention from these samples.

Harness scope warning:
`strict-mjs`,
`strict-typescript`,
`validator`,
and `relaxed-rebuild` issue `status` commands in `lifecycle-latency-definitions.ts`.
The current `trust/command-classification.ts` classifies `status` as `skip-config`.
Their labels alone do not establish that they exercise config loading or rebuilding.
A consumer-boundary positive control remains required before drawing trust-cost conclusions.

## Actual-policy fixture execution

The same detached worktree contains a temporary `perf:policy-boundary` task.
It runs mount-free,
network-disabled containers under the same 2 GiB,
2 CPU,
and 256 PID bounds.
The local image adds only copied repository-owned artifacts and installed dependencies:

- the installed forbidden-strings executable;
- current Markdown-lint TypeScript source and its local dependency closure;
- the development host's Node 26.10.0 executable;
- `doc/planning/slint-ide-0x.md` as the Markdown workload.

The source closure includes the logger's source-level `module-async-time` import,
which is a workspace devDependency rather than a manifest runtime dependency.
No package installation,
network download,
real home mount,
GitHub remote,
or private scanner rules file is used.
The fixture uses the scanner's built-in rules plus a deterministic planted literal.
It is not yet the exact real-repository workload.

Positive controls precede timings:

- `status` must tolerate changed untrusted configuration while `add` rejects it;
- the actual Markdown CLI must rewrite a planted LFS image URL;
- an actual wrapped commit must reject the planted forbidden string without moving `HEAD`.

Within each fresh container,
compare policies disabled,
scanner enabled,
Markdown enabled,
and both enabled.
Every scenario uses actual wrapped staging and committing plus automatic local push,
paired with direct Git staging,
commit,
and local push.
Pair order alternates;
each scenario has 2 warm-ups and 10 recorded samples.
The complete scenario sequence runs twice in separate containers.
This probe does not enable a feature or change production policy settings.

Invocation:
`mise run //package/git-policy/cli:perf:policy-boundary` in the detached worktree.
The initial attempt failed before JavaScript because the copied Node 26 binary lacked `libatomic.so.1`.
A Node 26 base image resolved that fixture packaging error;
the next attempt reached a separate configuration error because disabled option-bearing policies still need option values.
The corrected fixture supplied severity-plus-options tuples.

Managed process:
`cli-git-actual-policy-latency-valid-options`.
Status:
stopped after the user's direction to stop unnecessary rewrite evaluation.
Container listing after termination showed no running containers.
No completion result or causal performance conclusion is claimed.
Do not restart this experiment merely to finish its planned sample count.

## Next action

Confirm the agreed first-release scope without reopening Rust:
JSONC via the repository package,
shipped policies only,
bundled forbidden-strings,
no executable-config trust subsystem,
repository-controlled policy settings,
and preservation of required Git behavior.
The expanded 2.x catalog is excluded.
Proceed to implementation only after shared understanding is confirmed.
