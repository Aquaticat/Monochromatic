# Roster calibration under the owner blocklist, 2026-09-01

Evidence record for the seating step of the owner's R3 order
(`doc/decision/translation-repair-roster-blocklist.md`:
"code lands verified, calibration seats the roster, four-entry pass, reading").
Both calibration instruments ran on the nine-model roster at build `48799e6d1`
in the `translation-repair` worktree.
The seating decision itself is recorded separately once the seating-grade editor run lands;
this document carries the numbers that decision cites and the seating rules written before those numbers arrived.

## Status

-   `producer-calibrate` over 40 rounds: complete, standings recorded here.
-   `editor-calibrate` at its 6-slice default: complete, recorded here as a same-day replicate,
    not as seating evidence (the repo's own record calls a standing this small noise).
-   `editor-calibrate` over 40 slices: launched at 21:44Z on the same build,
    four slices in flight, 300000 ms straggler window.
    Log at `~/temp/agent/editor-calibrate-40-20260901.log`.
    Editors and refiners are seated from this run alone.
-   Logs of the two finished runs: `~/temp/agent/producer-calibrate-40-20260901.log`
    and `~/temp/agent/editor-calibrate-6-20260901.log`.

## The roster measured

Synthetic (subscription): `hf:Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B`, `hf:moonshotai/Kimi-K3`, `hf:openai/gpt-oss-120b`,
`hf:zai-org/GLM-5.3-Flash`.
Charm Hyper (metered credits): `glm-5.3`, `gemma-4-26b-a4b-it`, `minimax-m3`, `deepseek-v4-pro-0813`,
`deepseek-v4-flash-0731`.
`glm-5.3` and `GLM-5.3-Flash` are the two admissions of the post-blocklist catalog refresh;
`qwen3.8-flash` and `qwen3.8-2.4t-a95b` were culled before either run on the forced-tool-choice probe.

Seats in production at the time of measurement (`src/corpus-run/run-config.ts`):
critics, panel, judges and translators are the whole roster;
editors and refiners are Kimi-K3, Qwen3.8-27B and gemma-4-26b-a4b-it;
checkers are Qwen3.8-27B, Kimi-K3 and gpt-oss-120b with self-certification permitted at half weight.

Quorum arithmetic at nine: `gatherStageVoices` needs `ceil(9 / 2)`, which is 5 voices.
`minBallotWeight` stays the absolute 3, so the share of the panel that must cast a non-abstain ballot is 3 of 9,
33 percent, inside the range already lived at ten models (30 percent) and eight (37.5 percent).

## How the numbers are read

Every standing counts disinterested ballots only: a judge's ballot for its own candidate is excluded.
The pooled null is every disinterested win over every disinterested ballot in that standing,
and each model's z is its share against that null with the null's own standard error,
which is the ballot-level statistic the 2026-08-24 seating used.
The Bonferroni two-sided threshold for nine comparisons is z 2.77.
The availability-adjusted share charges a model zero for every round it produced nothing in:
raw share times candidates over rounds.
Ballots within one round share a slate and are not independent,
so the z is a ranking aid rather than a p-value.

## Producer calibration, 40 rounds

Every model wrote each slice from the source and every model judged.
Ran 18:15:54Z to 20:57:58Z (9734 s), one slice at a time,
under the 180000 ms production straggler window because `producer-calibrate` has no calibration dial yet
(`doc/decision/translation-repair-calibration-overlap.md` lists that as follow-up work).

Standing as printed, best first:

-   `hf:Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B`: 35.5 percent (83 of 234 disinterested ballots, over 40 candidates)
-   `glm-5.3`: 17.2 percent (35 of 204, over 36 candidates)
-   `gemma-4-26b-a4b-it`: 16.4 percent (36 of 219, over 40 candidates)
-   `hf:zai-org/GLM-5.3-Flash`: 12.7 percent (27 of 213, over 38 candidates)
-   `minimax-m3`: 11.8 percent (25 of 211, over 40 candidates)
-   `hf:moonshotai/Kimi-K3`: 9.5 percent (21 of 221, over 40 candidates)
-   `deepseek-v4-pro-0813`: 6.9 percent (15 of 218, over 40 candidates)
-   `hf:openai/gpt-oss-120b`: 2.4 percent (5 of 207, over 40 candidates)
-   `deepseek-v4-flash-0731`: 2.4 percent (5 of 208, over 40 candidates)

Pooled null 13.02 percent (252 wins of 1935 ballots). Read against it:

-   `Qwen3.8-27B` clears the null at z +10.20, adjusted share 35.5 percent, 40 of 40 candidates.
-   `gemma-4-26b-a4b-it` z +1.50 and `glm-5.3` z +1.75 (adjusted 15.4 percent, 36 of 40) are not separable from the null.
-   `GLM-5.3-Flash` z -0.15 (adjusted 12.0 percent, 38 of 40), `minimax-m3` z -0.51, `Kimi-K3` z -1.56,
    `deepseek-v4-pro-0813` z -2.69: not separable.
-   `gpt-oss-120b` z -4.53 and `deepseek-v4-flash-0731` z -4.55 sit under the null.

Seat lines: every model answered every ask usably except `Kimi-K3` (78 of 79, one thrown),
`GLM-5.3-Flash` (77 of 82, five thrown) and `glm-5.3` (63 of 78, fifteen thrown).

## Editor calibration, 6-slice default

Every model edited each slice through the whole repair lane and every model judged;
the refiner standing comes off the same spend.
Ran 20:59:21Z to 21:35:36Z (2185 s), four slices in flight, 300000 ms window.
Two of the six slices (GLaDOSister chunk 0, zheermao101 chunk 8) carried nothing eligible and bought no round;
the other four (Everythings99 chunk 6, lxyddice chunk 2, shihai4h chunk 12, donotexist_A chunk 1)
bought 14 editor rounds and 4 refiner rounds.

EDITOR standing over 14 judged rounds, from 4 of 6 slices:

-   `hf:zai-org/GLM-5.3-Flash`: 28.8 percent (30 of 104, over 16 candidates)
-   `glm-5.3`: 25.8 percent (24 of 93, over 16 candidates)
-   `hf:Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B`: 20.0 percent (20 of 100, over 16 candidates)
-   `hf:moonshotai/Kimi-K3`: 13.1 percent (13 of 99, over 16 candidates)
-   `deepseek-v4-pro-0813`: 7.1 percent (6 of 85, over 14 candidates)
-   `minimax-m3`: 6.8 percent (6 of 88, over 15 candidates)
-   `hf:openai/gpt-oss-120b`: 5.5 percent (5 of 91, over 15 candidates)
-   `gemma-4-26b-a4b-it`: 1.1 percent (1 of 90, over 12 candidates)
-   `deepseek-v4-flash-0731`: 0.0 percent (0 of 90, over 14 candidates)

Pooled null 12.50 percent (105 of 840).
`GLM-5.3-Flash` z +5.04 and `glm-5.3` z +3.88 clear it; `Qwen3.8-27B` z +2.27 and `Kimi-K3` z +0.19 do not separate;
`gemma-4-26b-a4b-it` z -3.27 and `deepseek-v4-flash-0731` z -3.59 sit under it.
The gemma reading is the one that matters for the current seats:
a model that writes from the source at the roster's second-best rate wrote the worst edits on this sample,
which is the divergence the editor instrument exists to catch and the writer instrument cannot.

REFINER standing over 4 judged rounds, from 4 of 6 slices:

-   `hf:zai-org/GLM-5.3-Flash`: 34.4 percent (11 of 32, over 4 candidates)
-   `minimax-m3`: 31.3 percent (5 of 16, over 2 candidates)
-   `deepseek-v4-pro-0813`: 18.8 percent (6 of 32, over 4 candidates)
-   `hf:moonshotai/Kimi-K3`: 18.8 percent (3 of 16, over 2 candidates)
-   `gemma-4-26b-a4b-it`: 9.4 percent (3 of 32, over 4 candidates)
-   `hf:openai/gpt-oss-120b`: 4.2 percent (1 of 24, over 3 candidates)
-   `glm-5.3`: 4.2 percent (1 of 24, over 3 candidates)
-   `hf:Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B`: 0.0 percent (0 of 16, over 2 candidates)
-   `deepseek-v4-flash-0731`: 0.0 percent (0 of 8, over 1 candidate)

Pooled null 15.00 percent (30 of 200); only `GLM-5.3-Flash` clears it (z +3.07), and four rounds decide nothing.

Editors shipped on 4 of 6 slices: `glm-5.3` wrote shipping text on two, `GLM-5.3-Flash` on one, `Qwen3.8-27B` on one.
Shipping is not a preference: it includes text every editor proposed identically, which no judge was asked about.

Seat lines: every model was asked 54 times; `Kimi-K3` and `glm-5.3` each lost one, the rest answered all.
Other warnings: `deepseek-v4-flash-0731` failed the select schema guard twice (parsed JSON, wrong shape,
recovery round failed the same way), `Qwen3.8-27B` returned one select answer with a bad control character,
one HTTP 503 was retried.

Why this run does not seat anyone: `doc/decision/translation-repair-calibration-overlap.md` records a four-slice
EDITOR standing moving one model from 52.2 percent to 26.7 to 10.0 across identical runs,
and names more slices as the remedy.
`bench-sample.ts` draws a deterministic stride over slices ordered by source size,
so the 40-slice draw is a different sample from the 6-slice draw and the two are not pooled.

## Reliability of the two new admissions

The two instruments ran under different straggler windows, and that is where the `glm-5.3` numbers come from:

-   Under the 180000 ms production window (producer calibration) `glm-5.3` lost 14 streams to the window
    after quorum (10 at select, 4 at translate) plus one select AbortError: 15 of 78 asks, 19 percent.
    Read per role: 4 of 40 translate asks (10 percent) as a writer, 11 of 38 select asks (29 percent) as a judge
    over a slate of up to ten candidates.
    Each cut stream had delivered about 2 M raw SSE characters, zero content characters and tens of thousands
    of reasoning characters: the model reasons past the window and never reaches its answer.
-   Under the 300000 ms calibration window (editor calibration) it lost 1 of 54, a panel stream cut after 3.45 M
    raw characters.
-   The corpus pass runs under the 180000 ms window (`corpus-pass.ts` resolves `STRAGGLER_GRACE_MS`),
    so the 19 percent figure is the one that describes production.
    A lost judge voice thins a nine-judge panel rather than biasing it, and the stage had already reached quorum
    every time; the cost is metered output.
-   `GLM-5.3-Flash` lost 6 streams the same way in the producer run (3 select, 2 translate, one transport cut
    retried) and none in the editor run.

Cut streams emit no `SPEND` line: `reportSpend` in `hyper-client.ts` and `synthetic-client.ts` runs after
`extractAnthropicCompletion` on a drained reply, and a stream abandoned at the window never reaches it.
`spend-report` therefore understates `glm-5.3`.
Summing the reasoning characters the cut streams delivered (954109 in the producer run, 121962 in the editor run)
at four characters per token gives about 238657 and 30491 output tokens,
which at the 95.8144 credits per million output rate is about 22.9 and 2.9 credits unbilled in the logs.

## Meters and spend

Synthetic weekly allowance remaining: 19.25 percent when the producer run started (18:15Z),
19.16 at its last reading (20:53Z), 19.07 when the editor run started (20:59Z), 17.83 at its last reading (21:34Z).
The five-hour meter never fell under 2737 of 2750.
Both runs cost near 1.6 points of the weekly allowance gross once the allowance's continuous regeneration
over each run's wall clock is added back.
Charm Hyper balance: 7272 to 7135 credits across the producer run, 7134 to 7077 across the editor run
(one credit is five cents).

Every Synthetic seat has a Hyper route (`qwen3.8-27b`, `kimi-k3`, `gpt-oss-120b`, `glm-5.3-flash`),
so a dry Synthetic allowance moves cost onto credits rather than emptying seats.

Token totals from `SPEND` lines, prompt then completion:

Hyper rates in credits per million tokens as read 2026-09-01 (`src/corpus-run/hyper-price.ts`):
`glm-5.3` 30.4864 in and 95.8144 out; `minimax-m3` 6.5328 and 26.1312; `deepseek-v4-pro-0813` 28.74432 and 86.23296;

`kimi-k3` 65.328 and 326.64.

## Slice-clustered reading of the 6-slice replicate

A second reviewer (sol, reading the standings file) made two points the first rules had missed:
the slice, not the ballot, is the independent unit (14 editor rounds came from 4 slices),
and "the leader clears the null" says nothing about seats two and three or the boundary between three and four.
The log does not carry the authorship of losing candidates, so per-slice ballot shares cannot be rebuilt from it;
what it does carry is every round's winner
(`[decideBestCandidate] candidate N from <author> won weight W across B ballots`, tagged by slice),
which supports a round-win share per model and a bootstrap over whole slices.
The reader is `~/temp/agent/round-wins-bootstrap-20260901.mjs`; a composite winner credits each author one share,
as the standing does.
Control on the 6-slice log: it found 12 winner-bearing editor rounds of the 14 judged
(two rounds cast ballots and crowned nobody) and 4 of 4 refiner rounds.

EDITOR round wins over 12 rounds from 4 slices, with top-three inclusion over 4000 slice resamples:
`GLM-5.3-Flash` 5 wins (92.7 percent inclusion), `glm-5.3` 5 (82.9), `Qwen3.8-27B` 4 (72.8), `Kimi-K3` 3 (50.7),
`gpt-oss-120b` 1 (0.0), `minimax-m3` 1 (0.0); the rest won nothing.
Three of the twelve winners were composites credited to several authors.
REFINER round wins over 4 rounds: `GLM-5.3-Flash` 2 (94.0 percent inclusion), `deepseek-v4-pro-0813` 1 (69.7),
`minimax-m3` 1 (67.8).

The replicate also shows the editor and refiner standings reversing for four models
(`glm-5.3` and `Qwen3.8-27B` second and third as editors, near zero as refiners;
`deepseek-v4-pro-0813` and `minimax-m3` the other way round),
which four rounds cannot establish but which is enough to say "refiners are the editors" is a transfer assumption,
not a measurement.

## Seating rules, written before the 40-slice numbers arrive

Revised at 22:10Z on the reviewer's points, while the 40-slice run stood at slice 6 of 40 with no refiner round
printed yet, so still before any number they decide on existed.

1.  Editors are seated from the 40-slice EDITOR standing alone.
    The 6-slice run is a same-day replicate that shows the band; its editor rounds are never pooled in.
2.  Editors: the top three by availability-adjusted share of disinterested ballots in the 40-slice EDITOR
    standing (printed share times candidates over rounds; every round seats the same nine judges,
    so the product weights rounds about equally).
    Two readings go beside it that the ballot-level z cannot give: the slice-clustered round-win bootstrap
    (round-win share and top-three inclusion probability), and production-window reliability from the
    180000 ms instrument (voices lost per ask in the producer calibration, by role).
    If the third and fourth seats sit within 10 points of top-three inclusion,
    the seat goes to the one that lost fewer voices under the production window.
3.  Refiners: the REFINER rounds of the 6-slice and 40-slice runs are pooled as slice clusters
    (same build, same instrument, same 300000 ms window; slices from two strides are distinct clusters).
    If at least 12 pooled slices reached a rewriter, the refiners are the top three by availability-adjusted
    share over the pooled rounds, with the same two beside-readings and the same tie rule.
    If fewer, the refiners are the editors, recorded as an unvalidated transfer assumption,
    and a refiner-targeted calibration is filed as follow-up.
4.  Checkers stay Qwen3.8-27B, Kimi-K3 and gpt-oss-120b.
    No instrument ranks checkers: `checker-sensitivity` asks whether checkers can say no on fixtures,
    and the `run-config.ts` note already says the writer and editor instruments are far from checking.
    The gap is recorded as a gap.
5.  Wide roles (critics, panel, judges, translators) stay the whole roster.
    Only the owner blocklist removes a model from the roster; writers under the null still judge,
    since neither instrument measures judge accuracy.
    One question goes to the owner rather than being decided here: the producer standing places
    `gpt-oss-120b` and `deepseek-v4-flash-0731` under the null as writers with full availability
    (40 of 40 candidates each), which is a quality finding about the translator seat specifically.
    `RUN_TRANSLATE_MODELS` was measured at full width, so narrowing it is a design change, not a seating.
6.  `glm-5.3`'s reliability is read off the 180000 ms instrument, because that is the corpus pass's window,
    and by role: 10 percent of translate asks lost as a writer, 29 percent of select asks lost as a judge.

## Owner authorization of 2026-09-01 and the drops made on it

The owner wrote mid-run: "I authorize you to drop any model from any role, as long as you have evidence.
These doesn't count as design decisions."
That settles the question rule 5 had put to the owner and narrows the owner-blocklist-only clause to roster
membership: a role drop on measured evidence is part of this seating.

Latency of completed streams per model, from the two logs (`>180 s` counts completed streams that ran past the
production window's length, an upper bound on further cuts under it, since the window starts at quorum):

-   `glm-5.3`: producer run p50 61 s, p90 166 s, max 221 s, 14 cut and 4 completed past 180 s of 77;
    editor run p50 66 s, p90 172 s, max 278 s, 2 cut and 4 past 180 s of 55.
-   `GLM-5.3-Flash`: producer run p50 66 s, p90 153 s, 6 cut and 4 past 180 s of 83;
    editor run p50 52 s, p90 199 s, none cut and 6 past 180 s of 54.
-   `Kimi-K3`: producer p50 26 s, p90 104 s, 1 cut and 1 past 180 s; `Qwen3.8-27B`: p50 33 s, p90 77 s, none.
-   Every other model: p90 under 50 s, nothing past 120 s except two gemma streams in the editor run.

Schema-mismatch lines by model and stage, recovery re-asks included:
`deepseek-v4-flash-0731` at select 8 (producer) and 4 (editor), every one a numeric string where the guard wants
a number (`"best": "8"`); `Qwen3.8-27B` at select 2 (editor run, one answer with a bad control character).

Drops made before the 40-slice standing:

-   Translator seat: `hf:openai/gpt-oss-120b` and `deepseek-v4-flash-0731` leave
    `RUN_TRANSLATE_MODELS.translatorModelIds`.
    Evidence: the 40-round producer standing, 5 of 207 and 5 of 208 disinterested ballots, z -4.53 and -4.55
    against the pooled null, at 40 of 40 candidates each, so the finding is about writing, not availability.
    Both keep every other seat.
    With seven translators and eight judges every slate keeps at least two disinterested judges
    (`assertJudgeableProducerRoster`'s floor) and the translator quorum is 4 of 7.
-   Judge seat, both lanes: `glm-5.3` leaves `judgeModelIds`.
    Evidence: under the production window it lost 11 of 38 select asks (29 percent), each loss holding the round
    for the whole window after quorum and delivering about 2 M raw characters of reasoning that never reached an
    answer, at the roster's highest output rate; its completed select streams are the roster's slowest.
    It keeps the critic, panel and translator seats, where no production-window measurement exists
    (the editor calibration ran at 300000 ms and lost 1 of 54 there); the four-entry pass logs abandons by role
    and supplies that evidence.
-   Not dropped: `deepseek-v4-flash-0731` as a judge loses about a tenth of its select ballots to the numeric
    string shape, a parser tolerance question filed as follow-up rather than evidence about its judgment;
    `GLM-5.3-Flash` as a judge lost 6 of 83 asks (7 percent) under the production window and none under
    300000 ms, and stays.

## Stale text the seating edit fixes in `run-config.ts`

-   `RUN_ROSTER` says "EIGHT MODELS NOW"; the roster is nine.
-   `RUN_READER_MODELS` says "Four of the eight read images"; four of the nine do.
-   The quorum paragraph stops at ten; nine needs 5 voices and puts `minBallotWeight` at 3 of 9.
-   If two GLM-family models take editor seats, the provider-coverage paragraph must also name the family
    correlation, since it currently argues from providers alone.

## Before the four-entry pass

The pass keeps its own timing: one slice at a time and the built-in 180000 ms window
(`corpus-pass.ts` resolves `STRAGGLER_GRACE_MS`; only `editor-calibrate` adopts the 300000 ms calibration window
and the overlap of four).
The overlap decision doc leaves moving the pass to `#261`'s measurement.
So the pass launches at its defaults, not at "measured calibration values".

## Next action

Wait for the 40-slice run, read its EDITOR and REFINER standings, apply the rules, edit `run-config.ts`,
build, run the package suite, lint and types, commit, and record the seating decision in
`doc/decision/` beside the blocklist decision.
