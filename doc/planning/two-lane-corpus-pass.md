# Wiring both lanes into the corpus pass

Tracks `#89`, and carries the parts of `#96` and `#102` that only the artifact write is waiting on.

The pass runs the repair lane and writes a repair-only artifact.
`runDocumentLanes` already runs both lanes over one preparation and returns both,
and `openTranslateSliceCache` already exists,
so what is missing is the pass calling the driver and an artifact able to hold two lanes.

## What the launch is gated on

Not written down anywhere before now,
so writing it down is the point of this section.

The window trial (`#108`) is live against the same six models and is losing a voice on roughly a third of its arms.
A two-lane pass over 92 entries is thousands of competing calls,
and it would raise that loss rate in the middle of an experiment whose whole validity argument is that degradation lands symmetrically.
The trial reads its own record and revises from the ledger,
so nothing needs re-buying,
but the rate it reads has to be the trial's own rate and not one this pass caused.

**Build now, launch after the trial finishes.**

## The artifact goes into a fresh runs directory, and the guard already forces it

Measured 2026-08-16, not assumed:
104 artifacts across ten runs directories,
and **every one of them is unversioned**.
`artifactSchemaVersion` appears in none of them,
so schema version 1 has an empty population on disk despite being what the writer emits today.

Two mechanisms already make an in-place upgrade impossible,
which is the desired outcome rather than an obstacle:

-   `assertResumableGeneration` refuses a directory whose settled entries record a different pipeline digest,
    and any change to what runs moves the digest.
-   `settledEntryIds` counts an existing artifact as settled whatever wrote it,
    so a pass pointed at an old directory would skip those entries rather than rewrite them.

So the two-lane generation accumulates in a new `TRANSLATION_REPAIR_RUNS_DIR`,
and the 104 existing artifacts stay readable as what they are.

## Verified defects, with what each would have recorded

Every item here was checked against source before being believed,
including the ones a reviewer raised that turned out to be wrong.

### Confirmed and fixed

-   **Cache cleanup relabelled a settled entry as an error.**
    The discard ran inside the same `try` as the pipeline,
    so a failed unlink logged `TALLY status=ERROR` after the success line for an entry whose artifact was already on disk.
    Any reader counting statuses saw one entry in both counts.
    Fixed in `9b4c121fc`,
    together with two faults sharing the same block:
    the cache opened outside the `try`, so one unreadable cache directory ended the whole pass,
    and the deadline was armed after that open, so a resumed entry ran against a slightly different ceiling from a fresh one.

### Confirmed and fixed, second round

Landed as `306fad00e`, which closes every item in this section and the one below it.

`LaneSliceText` now states an `outcome` of `decided`, `not-evaluated`, `unfilled` or `incumbent-fallback`,
beside an `incumbentKind` saying whether the archive holds any wording at the slice at all.
`SliceDeliveryRecord` carries that outcome and a separate `delivery` naming what the document ends up with
(`replacement-shipped`, `replacement-withdrawn`, `incumbent-retained`, `gap-remains`),
so the `anchored` inference is gone from the decision and survives only as the fact it can actually answer.
`compareDocumentLanes` reports both lane outcomes and a `decisionComparison` beside the delivery verdict,
and its verdict vocabulary gained `gap-remains`.
`buildSliceDelivery` also refuses a shipped replacement on a blocked run,
and checks index sets against the prepared indices rather than against a numeric range.

The delivery ledger's three index contracts landed earlier, as `0c17123bf`, with guards shown to fail first.

### The state each item was in when it was found

-   **`LaneSliceText` collapses two different states into one absence.**
    `acceptedText` absent is documented as "the lane never reached this slice",
    and the translate lane also uses it for a slice it REACHED and could not fill:
    `translate-document.ts` passes those indices to `buildLaneSliceTexts` as `unfilledChunkIndices`,
    whose own comment says the lane reached them.
    `lane-comparison.ts` then reads `translateReached: theirs.acceptedText !== undefined`,
    so an unfilled passage is recorded as never examined.
    `carriedText` falls back to the blank incumbent, neither lane reads as having moved,
    and `judgeSlice` returns `archive-stands`:
    the record asserts the archive's translation stands at a passage where the archive has no translation and the lane looked and failed.
    Both halves of that row are false.

    `buildSliceDelivery` gets the common case right,
    but by inferring from whether the slice is `anchored` rather than from anything a lane reported,
    and that proxy fails in the other direction:
    a repair lane blocking at an anchored slice is `not-evaluated` in truth and `unfilled` by the proxy.

    The fix is an explicit outcome discriminant on `LaneSliceText`,
    so both consumers read a stated fact.
    Blast radius measured:
    three source files consume `acceptedText`, three call `buildLaneSliceTexts`, nine files including tests.

-   **A FOURTH state exists and the driver already knows about it.**
    `translate-document.ts:381` warns when `record.stageResult.heardTranslators === 0`,
    keeps the incumbent for that run and refuses to cache the slice,
    and line 431 collects those slices as `unheard`.
    They still enter `settled`,
    so `buildLaneSliceTexts` stamps them with `acceptedText` equal to the incumbent,
    and every consumer reads that as the lane having examined the slice and chosen to leave it alone.

    This is the window trial's lost-judge defect in the translate lane's producing stage:
    **a stage that heard nobody is recorded as a deliberate keep.**
    Any lane comparison run today counts unheard slices as agreement with the archive.

    So the outcome union needs four members, not three,
    and they separate on two questions rather than one:

    -   `decided`, the lane produced a wording.
    -   `not-evaluated`, the lane never reached the slice.
    -   `unfilled`, reached, no output, and NO incumbent to fall back on.
    -   `incumbent-fallback`, reached, no output, and an incumbent that therefore stands by default.

-   **Naming: the discriminant is `outcome`, not `reach`.**
    Three of the four states mean the lane reached the slice,
    so a field called `reach` invites the next reader to write `reach === 'decided'`
    and re-introduce exactly the defect above.

-   **Whether an incumbent exists is a SEPARATE axis, and cannot be inferred from blank text.**
    A content chunk may legitimately be blank, so `incumbentText === ''` does not mean the archive has nothing there.
    `LaneSliceText` needs `incumbentKind: 'present' | 'absent'` beside the outcome.
    This is the same critique as the `anchored` proxy, applied to the incumbent side.

-   **`SliceShipment` mixes evaluation with delivery, and one `kind` cannot hold both.**
    A blocked repair at an anchor is `not-evaluated` AND the gap remains;
    today it must pick one word for both facts.
    The two axes are evaluation (the four outcomes above) and delivery
    (replacement shipped, replacement withdrawn, incumbent retained, gap remains).

-   **The comparison answers a different question from the one it was built for.**
    `lane-slice-text.ts` opens by saying the point is whether both lanes produce the SAME ENGLISH,
    and `judgeSlice` compares what the documents CARRY.
    Two lanes accepting different replacements that are both withdrawn read as `archive-stands`;
    two lanes accepting the same replacement where only one ships read as `repair-only`.
    Both are true delivery facts and neither answers lane agreement,
    so the persisted comparison needs both verdicts rather than one word doing duty as both.

-   **The stopped-prefix invariant has a hole.**
    `buildLaneSliceTexts` rejects a slice decided after an undecided one,
    but an `unfilled` slice after a `not-evaluated` one passes,
    which asserts the lane resumed after stopping.
    The invariant should reject any later REACHED outcome, not only a later decision.

-   **"Same preparation" is not actually established by the comparison.**
    Equal slice counts, equal indices and equal incumbent text do not prove one preparation:
    two slices can carry the same target wording over different source passages,
    and every insertion incumbent is blank.
    A persisted comparison needs a preparation identity, or a per-slice identity covering source text and placement.

-   **Two more index-set gaps beyond the three now fixed.**
    `buildSliceDelivery` still lets a BLOCKED result claim a shipped replacement,
    and it range-checks indices rather than checking membership in the prepared set.

-   **The verdict vocabulary is a second, separate lie.**
    `judgeSlice` compares what the two documents CARRY while `reach` describes what the lanes DID,
    so both are needed;
    but `archive-stands` over an empty incumbent asserts a translation that does not exist.
    It needs splitting into a wording-stands case and a gap-stands case.
    Not by dropping rows:
    a comparison whose row count stops equalling the slice count is invisible absence again.

### Confirmed and fixed, third round

Landed 2026-08-16, after a review of the second round by both reviewers.
The working state, including what is mid-flight at any moment,
lives in `doc/handover/two-lane-outcome-vocabulary.md`.

-   **The repair lane decided the empty string at every gap in the archive.**
    It mends existing English, so at a passage the archive never translated it has nothing to work on:
    `repair-translation.ts` skips the slice, `notApplicableRepair` returns `repairedText: ''`,
    and `repair-assemble.ts` fed every outcome to the wording builder as a DECISION.
    `compareDecisions` then read that against a translate lane that had actually filled the passage
    and returned `{ kind: 'comparable', verdict: 'different' }`:
    a row asserting the two lanes chose different wordings where one of them never had an opinion.

    Fixed by a FIFTH outcome member, `not-applicable`, and a repair-side adapter
    (`repair-lane-wordings.ts`) mirroring the translate lane's.
    Both reviewers ranked the options the same way and for the same reason.
    Folding these into `unfilled` was rejected because `unfilled` is a lane that tried and produced
    nothing, which is a rate `#105` wants measured,
    and the fold would make the repair lane's decline rate equal the number of gaps in the archive:
    a constant of the document that measures nothing about the lane.

-   **The two axes could contradict each other and nothing checked.**
    Three combinations describe a slice that cannot exist,
    every field of each is individually well formed,
    and no later join or count could detect one.
    `wording-coherence.ts` now states the rule once,
    and the delivery ledger and the lane comparison each assert it for themselves
    rather than trusting whoever built the wordings.

-   **The comparison joined two lanes that disagreed about whether the archive translates a slice.**
    It compared incumbent TEXT only, which cannot separate a blank content slice from an anchor,
    and then took every row's `incumbentKind` from the repair lane.

-   **A blocked run could be told a slice was withdrawn by assembly.**
    That exit never assembles, so the withdrawal it reports is the block,
    and the two are the events a reader counting integrity damage has to tell apart.

-   **The non-comparability reason was a free string naming one lane.**
    A slice neither lane decided reported only the repair lane, since that was the first checked.
    It is now `undecidedLanes`, which holds both.

-   **The three named index lists were three copies of the same five checks.**
    That is how their pairwise disjointness came to be checked in one direction only.
    They now share `lane-slice-sets.ts` and differ by data.

-   **The resume-first comment claimed a progress guarantee that does not hold.**
    It said a cap-abort always completes at least one new slice.
    An abort can land before the first persistence, and the slices a lane deliberately leaves uncached,
    the unfilled and the unheard, produce no cache entry however long they took.
    What actually bounds it is that a stuck entry surfaces as a repeated same-entry ERROR line.

### Raised by review and refuted

Recorded so a later session does not re-derive them.

-   **"No abort check after `refineSettledSlices`."**
    False.
    The check is in the callee, `repair-refine-step.ts:129`,
    with `stage-round.ts:311` behind it,
    and `repair-translation.unit.test.ts` already carries a case that aborts on the first rewrite request and asserts the run rejects.
    The reviewer read the caller only.

-   **"Two cache roots will make `listResumableEntries` treat `repair` and `translate` as entry ids."**
    False, because there are no two roots.
    A lane namespace is a FILENAME PREFIX inside one per-entry directory,
    and `discardNamespace` is prefix-scoped,
    so both lanes share `slice-cache/<entry>/`,
    a generation mismatch in one lane leaves the other's slices alone,
    and `listResumableEntries` needs no change.

## Decisions taken

-   **One artifact holding both lanes, not two files.**
    Two files admit a torn pair, one lane present and the other missing or from another attempt,
    and every reader would have to join by id and re-validate generation, corpus revision and slicing.
    The directory scanners already treat one JSON stem as one settled entry.

-   **Both lanes nested, neither at the top level.**
    Leaving the repair fields where they are and appending a translate block would answer Question 5 invisibly:
    a later reader would take top-level `repairedText` as "the output" and never learn a second lane existed.
    That is the failure `document-lanes.ts` exists to prevent, stated in its own opening comment.
    The cost is a version dispatch in each of the five artifact readers, which is what the version field was added for.

-   **The two-lane fields are REQUIRED at the new version, not optional.**
    The new writer always has both lanes, so an optional field could only ever be absent by accident,
    and absence-ambiguity is what `#96` bought the version machinery to end.

-   **The per-call deadline stays out of both cache keys.**
    It changes nothing any model is asked, only how long this side waits.
    Recorded at both keys in `351f53656`;
    the translate key had already decided it and the repair key had only omitted it.

-   **A lane that had no work to do says so, rather than deciding nothing.**
    Adopted 2026-08-16 without asking, because the evidence determines one answer:
    the alternative corrupts a rate `#105` exists to measure.
    Recorded here and in the handover so it can be reversed on sight.
    `not-applicable` means the lane reached the slice and its work has no input there;
    it is legal only where the archive holds no wording,
    it is a REACHED outcome so the stopped-prefix rule still refuses it after an unexamined slice,
    and the blocked exit therefore intersects anchors with the prefix it actually settled.

-   **Both translate roles take the whole roster.**
    The lane has a producing stage and a ranking stage and no third,
    so the editor and checker exclusions have nothing to exclude,
    and it is the width the judge-fidelity probe and the window trial both measured.
    Landed as `RUN_TRANSLATE_MODELS` in `e161bc7f7`.

## The artifact at version 2, as designed

Both reviewers converged on this shape.
It is written down here rather than held in a session, because it is the next commit.

One shared `preparation` block, one nested `lanes` object, and no top-level lane fields at all:
keeping `status`, `issues` or `repairedText` at the top would silently make repair the default lane,
which is the question `runDocumentLanes` exists to leave open.

-   `artifactSchemaVersion: 2`, required and read FIRST,
    so a reader dispatches on the version rather than on which fields it recognizes.
    Unversioned artifacts stay explicitly legacy; they are not relabelled version 1.
-   `provenance`: tip, pipeline digest, corpus commit.
-   `execution`: timestamp, duration, lane order, call configuration.
    Call TIMING lives here; rosters do not, because they are a lane's own.
-   `preparation`: the identity below, plus the shared slice manifest,
    the source and incumbent text of every slice, placement kind and offsets,
    the line-structured flag, identity context as a present-or-absent value,
    and the alignment findings and pair count for audit.
    Putting the text here rather than under both lanes stops it being stored twice
    and gives the reader one authoritative incumbent kind.
-   `lanes.repair` and `lanes.translate`: each with its own roster arrays, effective configuration,
    status, final document text, per-slice `outcome` and `delivery`,
    shipped and withdrawn evidence, findings, and lane-specific evidence.
    Counts are derived where possible and asserted against their arrays where stored.
-   `comparison`: bound explicitly to the preparation identity, built from validated delivery rows,
    carrying both outcomes, both deliveries, and structured non-comparability.
    Recomputed at artifact build time and refused if it disagrees with the persisted copy.
-   `laneSelection: { kind: 'pending-human-decision' }`.
    An omitted winner field would be absence encoding a meaningful state, which is the defect class again.

The unions serialize as tagged objects, never flattened to strings:
readers dispatch on `kind`, which is what the discriminants bought.

### The preparation identity

Computed over a versioned canonical manifest of the preparation itself,
never over the artifact, the run, or the cache.
Payload: a domain separator and manifest version, the source and target document digests,
and one ordered row per slice carrying the global index,
both sides' placement kind, offsets and exact text, their pairing through the shared row,
and the line-structured flag, plus identity context stated as present-with-text or absent.

The TARGET PLACEMENT KIND is the field that earns this:
without it a blank content slice and an anchor hash identically,
which is exactly the pair the whole vocabulary change exists to separate.

Framing must be unambiguous under arbitrary slice text,
so fields are length-prefixed rather than separated by a byte the text is assumed not to contain.

Excluded on purpose: tip, pipeline digest, corpus commit, schema version, rosters, call configuration,
timestamps, durations, cache keys, resumed counts, lane outputs, findings and comparison results.
That gives the two properties wanted:
changing boundaries, pairing, ordering, placement kind, offsets, text or governance changes the identity,
while resuming the same manifest under a different commit, cache state or roster leaves it alone.
`pipelineDigest` stays the separate execution-generation identity.

### What the version 2 parser must require, and what it may tolerate

REVISED 2026-08-16 after a review of the contract itself, before any parser code was written.
Five clauses were wrong and are corrected below;
each correction says what it replaces, because the old wording is what a later reader would otherwise re-derive.

#### What is required, and what version 2 actually owns

**Corrected.** The old clause read "Every field is REQUIRED".
That contradicts the writer: `SettledLaneV2.result` is typed by the LIVE lane shapes on purpose,
because raw results are evidence, they are large, and they grow by addition.
Requiring every field of them would make each later additive field a retroactive version 2 requirement,
and would leave version 2's meaning defined by whatever the TypeScript types happen to say today
rather than by this document.

The rule instead:

>   Every field OWNED BY THE VERSION 2 SCHEMA is required, including every field of the frozen
>   raw-evidence core. Fields added later to the live raw-result types are tolerated and never
>   become version 2 requirements.

So version 2 needs a FROZEN EVIDENCE CORE: the few raw fields a reader verifies against the ledger,
named under version 2's own types rather than borrowed from the pipeline.
Per `sliceTexts` row that is `chunkIndex`, `incumbentKind`, `incumbentText`, `outcome.kind`,
and `outcome.acceptedText` where the outcome is decided.
The reader PROJECTS that core out of each raw row and compares the projection,
rather than deep-comparing a raw row against a strict ledger row.

Rows are compared BY POSITION, `chunkIndex` included, and never joined by `chunkIndex` alone:
a join accepts evidence in the wrong order, which is one of the things this check exists to catch.

#### Where exactness stops

**Corrected.** The old clause said unknown keys are refused in schema-owned records
and left the boundary to be inferred, which does not survive contact with a lane object
holding a strict ledger and a tolerant raw result side by side.

>   Exactness follows SCHEMA OWNERSHIP, not nesting.
>   The artifact, the preparation, the `lanes` record, each lane envelope, the delivery rows,
>   the comparison rows and every version 2 vocabulary union have exact keys.
>   `callConfig` and `lanes.<lane>.result` are open boundaries, and unknown keys are tolerated
>   recursively past either one, while the known evidence-core fields inside them stay required.

Consequences worth stating because each is a test:

-   `lanes` accepts exactly `repair` and `translate`; each lane accepts exactly `result` and `delivery`.
-   An extra key on a lane ENVELOPE is refused; the same key inside that lane's `result` is accepted.
-   An unknown outcome discriminator inside a raw result is REFUSED even there,
    because version 2 cannot project it into its frozen vocabulary.
-   A member-specific field on the wrong member (`acceptedText` on `not-evaluated`) stays a contradiction.
-   `null` is accepted inside an unknown raw-result addition and refused inside `callConfig`,
    which `ArtifactJsonValue` already forbids.

The old sentence "Within the discriminated unions ..." is scoped to SCHEMA-OWNED unions
and to the reserved fields of the evidence core, not to raw results at large.

#### Recomputed, checked, and merely syntactic

**Corrected on two items.**

The blocked status CANNOT be recomputed. A blocked run and an unblocked one produce the same ledger
whenever no slice decided anything different, so the derivation is not invertible.
What the reader checks is COMPATIBILITY:

-   a blocked repair result carries no `replacement-shipped` and no `assembly-integrity` withdrawal,
    and its differing decisions may be withdrawn as `blocked-non-translation`;
-   a non-blocked result carries no `blocked-non-translation` withdrawal at all.

"Its `unfilled` status against whether anything is unfilled" needs its subject named:
unfilled means a raw `sliceTexts` outcome of kind `unfilled`,
NOT a `gap-remains` delivery, which also arises after a `not-evaluated` or any other non-decision.

Everything else in the old recompute list stands:
slice counts against the preparation, ledger lengths against both,
the evidence core against the ledger row at the same position, each raw index set against the rows
that would produce it, the translate lane's counts against its own lists,
and the whole comparison against the persisted copy.

**Per-row coherence has to be assigned, and was not.**
The live comparator asserts `assertWordingCoherent` and `assertDeliveryCoherent` on every row it reads
(`lane-comparison.ts:515`), and the frozen comparison does not, so a reader running only the frozen
module would accept a row saying `replacement-shipped` beside an outcome of `not-applicable`
as long as each union parses on its own. Exact parsing checks the WORDS; these check the pair.

>   The reader runs both assertions on every parsed ledger row, in `artifact-v2-read-relations.ts`,
>   and translates their errors into `ArtifactParseError` naming the lane and the row position.
>   The version 2 row fields are structurally what those functions already accept,
>   so this is a call site rather than a second implementation.

#### What a file alone cannot establish

**Corrected.** The old clause said a corpus-aware reader "re-prepares the texts at the recorded corpus commit".
It cannot, from the file: `preparationIdentity` hashes both whole documents, every slice's placement and offsets,
the line-structure flag and the identity context, and the artifact stores none of those inputs.
`id` and `corpusSha` can recover the documents; nothing in the file fixes the preparation code or its budget.

>   The standalone reader checks the identity's SYNTAX and nothing more.
>   Verification against a preparation is a separate entry point that ACCEPTS one:
>   `verifyArtifactV2AgainstPreparation({ artifact, prepared, })`.
>   Whoever obtains the corpus checkout and the matching pipeline builds that preparation and passes it in.

The same limit applies to the preparation's measurements, to `tip` and `pipelineDigest`,
and to whether a raw result and the ledger beside it came from one run:
`assertResultCountsPreparation` already says the slice count is a cheap check and not a proof.

#### The comparison algorithm has to be frozen too (landed)

**New, and it was a defect in code already shipped.**
`buildSettledArtifactV2` derives the persisted comparison by calling the LIVE `compareDocumentLanes`
and projecting the result. The frozen vocabulary catches a union that grows;
nothing catches the comparator's SEMANTICS changing.
A later change to how a verdict is decided would silently reinterpret every artifact already on disk,
and a version 2 reader that recomputed with the same live comparator would agree with itself
while both disagreed with what the artifact meant when it was written.

>   The version 2 comparison derivation belongs in an artifact-owned module over `ArtifactDeliveryRowV2`,
>   used by BOTH the writer and the reader, and frozen with the rest of version 2.

Landed as `artifact-v2-comparison.ts`, and the writer refuses a disagreement between the two derivations
before it writes anything. Two corrections landed on top of it:
row equality is FIELD BY FIELD in `artifact-v2-row-equality.ts`, since the first version compared
serialized bytes while claiming key order did not matter, which would have trapped the reader
comparing rows parsed off disk; and the frozen module now refuses two ledgers that disagree about a
slice's ORIGINAL, which the live comparator already refused. The reader runs only the frozen module,
so any refusal missing from it is a refusal the reader does not have.

#### Version dispatch

**Corrected.** The old clause refused an explicit version 1.
A reader that understands a version should not refuse it, and `artifact-schema-version.ts`
states version 1 is readable; the empty population on disk is a fact about this corpus, not about the format.

>   Generic dispatch has four cases: a missing `artifactSchemaVersion` is LEGACY, `1` is version 1,
>   `2` is version 2, anything else is refused.
>   Only the function NAMED as the version 2 parser refuses version 1, and it refuses it because
>   dispatch has already happened by the time it is called.

A present-but-wrong version (`null`, `'2'`, `undefined`) is not the same as a missing one and is refused.

`readArtifactChangeSets` must REFUSE version 2 explicitly rather than be taught to read it:
it answers with one singular change set per artifact, and version 2 has two lanes and no singular anything.
It stays a legacy and version 1 adapter.

## Still to build

Items 1 through 7 have landed. What each turned into is recorded here rather than deleted,
because the shape several of them took differs from the shape they were planned in.

1.  ~~The artifact at version 2~~, landed across `artifact-v2-contract.ts`, `artifact-v2-vocabulary.ts`
    and `artifact-v2-build.ts`. The identity was folded into the same bump as planned,
    and then strengthened twice after review: it is DERIVED in the builder rather than accepted,
    and each ledger carries the slicing it was built over, stamped by the driver that built it.
2.  ~~`buildSettledArtifact` deriving its counts~~, landed as `e4f857c83`.
3.  ~~The preparation identity~~, landed as `preparation-identity.ts`.
4.  ~~`settleEntry` calling `prepareDocumentPair` and `runDocumentLanes`~~, landed as `04c6d85cf`.
    The `sliceCharBudget` clause was WRONG and is retracted:
    `prepareDocumentPair` defaults to the same `SLICE_CHAR_BUDGET` that `repairTranslation` passed down,
    so calling the preparation directly bypasses nothing. Measured, not assumed.
5.  ~~One deadline, `throwIfAborted()` after the driver returns~~, landed in the same commit,
    with the resumed-lanes case tested and shown to fail without the check.
6.  ~~Tests for `settleEntry`~~, landed as `592c06512` and `f0ea127c8`, all three paths covered.
    The cleanup failure turned out to be injectable by making the entry's cache directory read-only,
    since removal unlinks the entries inside a directory and needs write permission on the directory.
7.  ~~The translate lane's unheard stage~~, landed as `translate-unheard.ts`.
    ~~The repair lane has the SAME defect~~, closed as `#112` and landed as `repair-unheard.ts`:
    a repair slice no critic was heard about now reads `incumbent-fallback` rather than `decided`,
    measured before and after on a fixture where all 48 critic calls fail and quorum comes out 0 of 6.

Still open:

8.  `artifact-read.ts` keeps a discriminated `unrecorded` reading and then converts it back into an
    absent optional property, discarding the distinction its own parser established.
9.  ~~THE VERSION 2 PARSER~~, landed 2026-08-16 across eight commits, to the corrected contract in
    "What the version 2 parser must require, and what it may tolerate".
    Generic dispatch answers with a generation-discriminated reading; version 1 parsing moved to
    `artifact-v1-read.ts` keeping every exported name; `verifyArtifactV2AgainstPreparation` takes a
    rebuilt `PreparedDocumentPair` for the checks a file alone cannot make.
    Verified by writing a real artifact with `settleEntry` and reading it back.
10. The mixed-generation trap the wiring created: `settledEntryIds` reads FILENAMES only,
    so a pass resumed into a directory holding version 1 artifacts skips those entries
    and produces a corpus that is half one generation, invisibly.
    A fresh artifacts directory avoids it, and practice is not a guard.

## Open questions for the user

1.  Should the artifact store `sourceText` and `targetText` in full?
    It stores neither today and measures both.
    Storing them makes every artifact self-contained for re-analysis without a corpus checkout at the pinned commit,
