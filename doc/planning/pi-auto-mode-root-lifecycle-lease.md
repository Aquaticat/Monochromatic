# Private root lifecycle lease proposal

## Purpose and status

Propose a private lifecycle-only lease path inside the existing native-manager ownership registry.
This is not production adoption,
SDK deployment,
provider selection,
or authorization to create human permission.
The user accepted option A:
implement the private lifecycle-only contract first,
then address writer custody separately.
This acceptance does not authorize production deployment or permission creation.

The [instruction snapshot findings](../troubleshooting/pi-instruction-snapshots.md)
record the supporting controls:
`proc_70b6`,
`proc_1da7`,
`proc_7d74`,
and `proc_152e`.
The existing registry is the private
`contract/lifecycle/native-manager-dependency-controls/native-manager-adapter.mjs`.
Its historical fixed-session branch-snapshot interface stays intact.

## Proposed private scope

Bind a lease to exact `AgentSession` and `SessionManager` objects through their construction owner.
An ID,
role,
file path,
or copied record cannot mint one.
Keep lifecycle state distinct from request generation,
observed source freshness,
and prepared action data.

The lifecycle states are active,
suspended,
and retired.
A pending transition makes release temporarily unavailable.
A proven no-op or cancelled transition restores the same active lease without changing its epoch.
A committed transition or uncertain post-mutation failure retires the old lease permanently.
Returning to the same leaf does not revive it.
Ordinary assistant/tool-result appends do not themselves retire the lifecycle lease.

Examples the controls must distinguish:

-   An ordinary append keeps root lease A active.
-   A pending navigation suspends A;
    cancellation returns A to active only after proving no transition occurred.
-   A successful navigation retires A and issues B.
    Navigating back issues C,
    not A.
-   An in-memory fork issues another lease even when it reuses the manager object.
-   A replacement factory failure after disposal leaves A retired with the original exception retained.
-   A copied or foreign lease cannot release a prepared action.

The observer interface must distinguish temporary suspension from permanent staleness.
Its current irreversible stale latch must not silently convert a cancelled,
non-mutating operation into permanent retirement.

## What this does not solve

The lease is not a mutation detector.
A tested operation facade cannot claim exclusive custody of native state without separate evidence.
The native getter/append-argument probes exposed mutable message aliases;
cached and prototype method calls bypassed an instance hook.
Existing JSONL bytes remained unchanged while the active graph changed.

A private controlled-host profile must name its managed operations and uncovered writers.
Unclosed writer coverage remains a failed admission prerequisite for any production guard relying on the lease.
No blanket restriction on model-estimated semantic effects is introduced.

## Recommendation and alternative

Prototype the lifecycle-only contract in the existing registry first.
It reuses established ownership,
keeps ordinary appends separate from transitions,
and provides a consumer interface for testing suspension and retirement.
Its limitation is material:
it does not qualify production mutation custody.

The alternative is to defer the lease contract and investigate SDK-native state encapsulation first.
That targets the demonstrated alias and bypass surfaces directly,
but requires checking `SessionManager`,
projection consumers,
and extension access before changing their behavior.
The lease contract and SDK state work are complementary;
both can proceed in that order.

Ranking:
private lease contract followed by custody work > custody work before the lease contract,
because the first order makes the required lifecycle semantics explicit without claiming the writers are closed.
Neither order authorizes production cutover.

## Private prototype result

The sibling `contract/lifecycle/root-lifecycle-lease/` implementation passed `proc_ca4b`,
exit 0,
with 24 intact interface cases and five guard-removal failures.
Historical registry source remained unchanged.
The prototype shares canonical manager epochs across the branch and lifecycle interfaces,
while keeping branch snapshots independent of temporary lifecycle suspension.

Controls covered issuer identity,
exact session/manager pairing,
suspension and cancellation,
pre-effect retirement,
same-pair restoration,
same-manager session replacement,
uncertain failure,
explicit reopening,
shared epoch changes,
and trace failure/reentrancy handling.
Trace failures are retained without orphaning handles or changing completed operation outcomes.
Unmanaged borrowed mutation remains an explicit non-detection control.
No SDK session or external model request ran in this phase.

The observer bridge in `contract/lifecycle/root-lifecycle-observer/` then passed `proc_6f61`:
ten intact cases and three guard-removal failures.
Temporary suspension passed through without a permanent stale latch.
A refused new request during suspension did not supersede the original receipt after cancellation.
Source changes,
root retirement,
and genuine newer requests still made older receipts unusable.
This phase reused the actual collector and registry with constructor-shaped doubles,
not SDK sessions.

The stock SDK consumer in `contract/lifecycle/root-lifecycle-sdk/` passed `proc_4b83`:
five completed sessions,
five injected requests,
no tools or external model requests.
It suspended at operation entry,
resumed receipts after controlled no-op/cancel,
and retired them before selected native branch mutation.
Restoring the original leaf did not revive an old receipt.
A controlled mutator-entry failure retained its exact exception after retirement while leaving the leaf unchanged.

The prototype-dispatch control bypassed the selected instance hooks and left the receipt active.
That is an explicit uncovered writer,
not a safety pass or production mutation-coverage claim.
The accepted private lifecycle contract is now exercised at this bounded consumer seam.

## Accepted next action

Investigate SDK state encapsulation and its legitimate native consumers.
Use the tested lease contract as the target;
do not confuse selected-method interception with exclusive mutation custody.
Writer custody,
instruction authority,
and human permission remain separate unmet production gates.
Keep historical branch-snapshot behavior and consumed evidence intact.
