# Source-reviewed judge calibration fixtures

Task 32 blocks task 31 before paid V4.1 Flash calibration.
The serving integration in task 30 is complete;
production role holds remain unchanged.

## Why the historical fixtures cannot decide admission

The old judge probe labeled an archive slice “clean” merely because it was the unchanged archive.
A full source/target reading before the new calibration found:

- `hakureico/7` adds an unsupported technical cause and omits source facts.
  Its generated deletion removes both a supported lifespan statement and the unsupported cause.
- `noname/4` adds details absent from the supplied Chinese
  and strengthens a high-probability hate-crime assessment into certainty.
  Its generated deletion removes both source-supported uncertainty information and an incorrect certainty claim.

An independent advisor confirmed these readings.
A legitimate rejection of both candidates,
or preference for deleting an unsupported claim,
could therefore be scored as failure.
Those historical results are not source-grounded admission proof.
No existing production seat is retroactively removed on that diagnosis alone.

The attempted plan used no provider calls.
Its synthetic abstentions existed only to capture real compiled prompts.
An initial `modelPromptDigest` call used the wrong argument shape;
it was corrected to `{ request }` before the successful plan.
Neither the failed planning call nor planner abstentions are quality measurements.

## Reviewed replacement manifest

Selection occurred before any candidate or peer model response.
The replacement set keeps deletion,
insertion and numerical alteration,
with both candidate positions and both historical directions.
No source paragraph was padded or concatenated to meet the existing 400-character floor.

The manifest must use absolute pinned-file ranges,
not provisional deterministic slice indexes as authority.
All files remain at corpus commit `a41fc607ea5a70d8a7625cc67d5ed8c444f53379`.
Full passages and generated variants remain private in
`~/temp/agent/verified-fidelity-fixture-proposal-20260911.json`.

An independent advisor read every complete source/reference/damaged tuple
and accepted their material fidelity and single-delta ordering.
Interpretive latitude is allowed;
unverified concrete facts,
changed relationships and changed certainty are not.
The MTF portrait's broad description of distinctiveness is not rejected merely for avoiding literal wording.

## Instrument changes

The native judge probe and the admission driver must load reviewed references,
not rediscover the first long archive slice and call it clean.
A fixed manifest must bind:

- Corpus revision and exact source/archive ranges and hashes.
- Post-normalization reference hash.
- Any local reference edit,
  including its coordinate convention and provenance.
- Fixed insertion donor provenance.
- Generated damage hashes and intended single delta.

Refuse drift,
unreviewed context,
unavailable damage or references below the natural length floor.
Do not adjust scoring to make invalid fixtures pass.
The existing generic damage builders remain mechanisms,
not a source-faithfulness validator.

The new calibration reruns all peers and V4.1 Flash on the identical corrected questions,
without old ballot or prompt-cache reuse.
It grades actual individual ballots,
not an underweight singleton panel's merged verdict.
The admission criterion is unchanged:
candidate clean count at least the median peer clean count,
and damaged count no greater than the maximum peer damaged count.
Peer response quorum per question is required for an interpretable comparison.

## Implementation and verification checkpoint

The checked-in `fidelity-reference-*` modules now materialize the reviewed manifest,
verify exact ranges and hashes,
apply only original-coordinate local edits,
verify donor separation and damage outputs,
and select only reviewed entries.
`reviewed-fidelity-loader-verification-20260911.json` matched the compiled loader's full tuples
against the independently reviewed private artifact.
The native CLI uses this manifest rather than rediscovering a long archive slice.
No production role has changed.

The first sandboxed guard-removal run used committed source `9f4034d15`.
Every mutant rebuilt successfully;
nine categories caused their expected assertions to fail.
Coordinate validation,
edit overlap and donor overlap survived:
the old negative fixtures were rejected by downstream hashes after those guards were removed.
This is a verification gap,
not evidence that the guards are unnecessary.
The ledger is `~/temp/agent/fidelity-guard-mutations-20260911.json`.
Restored source rebuilt and passed its targeted suite.

`a0ec042a5` supplies otherwise-valid counterexamples:
JavaScript slicing that would return the same reviewed bytes despite invalid coordinates,
duplicate empty-replacement edits that would reconstruct the approved reference,
and an overlapping donor with insertion excluded so insertion hashing cannot mask its guard.
An independent advisor accepted these as isolated controls.
They remain unproven until the updated mutation run fails for each intended assertion.

Independent review also found a genuine request defect:
`some()` admitted a mixed request when only one requested family existed.
The library,
trial builder and native `--only gqt` preflight all demonstrated that failure in
`reviewed-matrix-red-unit-20260911.out`.
`3b03c5d01` now requires each requested family somewhere in the selected population,
not every family in every reference.
`634cca76d` adds a metadata-only corpus-pin check before preflight can report success.
Latest build,
types,
full-suite and guard verification are still pending.

The revised admission driver must persist:

- The exact default reviewed manifest and its digest,
  rather than treating arbitrary caller-provided manifests as admitted gold.
- Final model-independent question identity including actual messages and schema.
  `modelPromptDigest` is a model-specific payload-cache identity,
  not proof that peers saw an identical question.
- Separate model/provider cell identities,
  planned and attempted cells,
  individual heard or unusable outcomes and terminal completeness.
- The requested full matrix,
  with scoring deduplicated by actual question rather than historical direction bookkeeping.
- A fresh payload namespace that cannot contain old ballots or synthetic planner abstentions.
- Current cohort provenance checks against known fixture-edit authorship.
  The explicit spelling check in `reviewedFidelityRequest` is not a global model-alias resolver
  or a certification of all historical archive authorship.

The native default sixteen-row cap is a bounded exploratory prefix,
not complete admission evidence for this reviewed matrix.
The actual corrected request/question count must be regenerated and inspected before spending.
Existing duplicate-reference-ID validation in `fidelity-reference-select.ts` already applies;
review suggestions are checked against source rather than all being treated as new defects.
The approved tuple review remains valid while instrument verification continues.

## Instruction proposal

`AGENTS.md` rule `QIV` already requires validating scope,
caches and the harness.
Proposed clarification,
not applied:

```text
QIV: Validate scope, caches, harness, and gold references before trusting results.
Stale caches, contract-silenced fixtures, and unverified goldens answer different questions than asked.
```

The expected action is being performed:
source-read the fixtures,
replace invalid references,
lock their provenance and verify every generated comparison before spending on calibration.
