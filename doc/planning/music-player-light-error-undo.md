# Light error and Undo state-family continuation

## Purpose and existing decisions

This is the next independent design-only queue item after first-run evidence
and the proposed whole-map keyboard demonstration.
D82 closes custom Android notification design;
no notification variants are part of this work.
New keyboard assignments remain a proposal,
and this state-family work does not depend on their adoption.

D8 selects immediate trash with a compact,
content-width Undo toast rather than a confirmation dialog or full-width
snackbar.
D9 removes vanished rows and collapses multiple failures to a count.
D83 replaces the old layout-reserving error bar with auto-dismissing,
manually dismissible toast/snackbar overlays and a two-line message target.
Longer details direct users to Android logs.
D29's left alignment and 16dp owner separation remain applicable,
but no message may resize the player.
The unresolved work is carrying that current behavior into the light
surface and verified Fold geometry,
not asking about pill colour or spacing below their hard floors.

## Fresh emulator recovery authorized by the human

The previous guest is no longer the default capture target.
Its repeated System UI/launcher ANRs,
separate graphics failures and contained OOM event do not establish that
Pixel Fold emulation or one system image is inherently defective.
Agent-authored readiness,
path and scope mistakes also prolonged verification.

The authorized recovery is to provision fresh owned Pixel 9 Pro Fold
profiles,
verify boot/ADB/basic rendering before installing the debug APK,
and compare a fresh current API37 image with an independently acquired
API36 Google APIs image if needed.
Keep the emulator binary,
device profile,
APK and resource bounds recorded;
do not conflate a multi-variable improvement with an isolated root cause.
The current source APK and D83 requirements are unchanged by this
infrastructure work.

The fresh current-image control is `Pixel9ProFold_Fresh_5FXdOc`,
created by the installed device manager from the official
`pixel_9_pro_fold` profile.
Its AVD directory and persistent tool home are newly created;
no guest data,
settings or keys were copied from the retired probe or original user AVD.
Provisioning verified profile width `2076px`,
height `2152px` and density `390dpi`.
The current-image boot/readiness and pre-app baseline check are running
before any music-player installation.
The separately authorized API36 Google APIs image acquisition targets an
owned SDK directory and leaves the main SDK read-only.
Use of that alternate image is a comparison,
not a declaration that API37 caused the failures.
The installed `sdkmanager` delegates to Android CLI;
its package listing uses slash-form identifiers.
The acquisition guard's initial semicolon-form search rejected that list,
not an absent API36 package.
The observed exact package is
`system-images/android-36/google_apis/x86_64`,
version `7.0.0` in the stable listing.
The corrected direct Android CLI install uses that path,
`--no-metrics` and an owned SDK root.
No main-SDK update or original AVD mutation is part of acquisition.
API36 revision `7` installed and a separate official Pixel 9 Pro Fold AVD
was provisioned successfully.

The fresh API37 control displayed its actual debugging authorization
prompt;
the fingerprint matched the new guest's own generated key.
Direct approval yielded authorized ADB and completed-boot read-back.
Before installing the music-player APK,
four bounded focus samples showed the launcher,
no visible ANR and no logged fatal crash.
Its image fingerprint is
`google/sdk_gphone16k_x86_64/emu64xa16k:17/CE2A.260420.050/16231978:user/dev-keys`.
This is bounded baseline evidence,
not universal image stability or isolation of the older guest's cause.

The same current E2 overlay APK then passed the fresh cover/light/200%
long-detail and combined held-pose probe,
including log-capture intent.
The fresh guest then passed all four inner-panel lifecycle contexts:
light/dark at 100%/200% text.
Each context verified automatic expiry without manual input,
manual dismissal,
Undo intent,
full multiline/non-ASCII diagnostic read-back,
log-capture intent and unchanged measured player geometry.
The recorded expiry observations ranged from about `4.132s` to `5.192s`;
these are observed intervals,
not a new fixed product timeout.
Recorded fields were restored/read back,
the owner exited cleanly and matching runtime absence was verified.
Cover controls and current-artifact visual acquisition remain pending.
The alternative API36 guest remains separately provisioned for comparison;
no additional emulator is run concurrently with this native control.
The fresh guest reports different stock system insets from the retired
probe:
the focused cover frame's measured application root begins at `59px`,
not the old `152px` crop boundary.
Sanitization and same-scene pixel comparison must use the freshly measured
root,
not silently reuse the old status-strip size or crop app content away.
Physical panel size and density still match the official profile.

A subsequent API37 cold restart reached authorized readiness,
but the cover control's fresh frame/window check rejected a System UI ANR
that owned focus after the app launch.
The fresh guest's initial baseline and successful inner controls remain
valid bounded observations,
not proof that old userdata caused every failure or that cold restarts
are stable.
The failed cover visit restored its recorded fields and stopped.
The separately provisioned API36 Google APIs Fold is the next comparison,
using the same emulator binary,
renderer,
APK and 6GiB/2CPU limits.

The API36 Google APIs guest also passed its bounded pre-app focus/crash-log
samples,
then a cover frame exposed a Pixel Launcher ANR.
The event buffer identifies Google Play services startup/broadcast ANRs
and a launcher `NotificationListener` service timeout of `20565ms`
before the debug APK's activity launch.
That locates observed failures in startup work,
not an isolated image,
CPU or renderer cause.
The plain `system-images/android-36/default/x86_64` image is being acquired
as a separate control without Google apps.
The Google API36 guest is restored/stopped before that control boots.
Its first restoration read exceeded the command bound after emitting the
correct AVD name;
partial stdout was not counted as completed restoration.
The inspected `adb shell -x` path completed a direct identity read,
so recovery uses that transport with exact field read-back rather than
trusting remote exit status alone.
The plain AOSP API36 image revision `2` is now installed;
provisioning uses a separate new guest and tool home.
The API36 restoration's immediate read-back differed during the panel
transition;
a later independent read-back matched every originally recorded field.
Console shutdown was accepted after that equality check,
and the next runtime waits for matching container/process absence.
The AOSP control uses `Pixel9ProFold_AOSP36_UipH6W` on port `5580`,
within the inspected ADB emulator scan range.
Its initial baseline passed before the APK was installed,
and the same capped container's `emulator-check accel` reported
`KVM (version 12) is installed and usable.`
The first app probe rejected the inherited Google-image posture identifier
`0`:
AOSP `print-states` reports `1=CLOSED`,
`2=HALF_OPENED` and `3=OPENED`.
The harness now uses those measured identifiers and the supported `state`
command for this image.
That rejected command is a harness portability error,
not evidence of another AOSP ANR or failed app layout.
The subsequent AOSP inner-panel held-pose probe passed.
However,
neither a supported closed-state request nor the emulator's `fold` command
exposed a `1080x2424` cover display in this stock image:
SurfaceFlinger still listed only the `2076x2152` primary display.
That is a bounded observed configuration gap,
not a claim that every AOSP setup cannot support a cover display.
Its recorded fields were restored and the runtime exited cleanly.

The next controlled change keeps the fresh API37 AVD,
APK,
SwiftShader mode and caps,
but uses the browser-test container's native Ubuntu libraries and Xvfb
instead of mounting the host `/usr` into Fedora.
The emulator launcher version and in-container KVM availability probes
passed before this visit.
This tests the runtime library environment;
it does not identify a defective library or change the product design.
The first native-library attempt never launched QEMU:
`xvfb-run` was PID 1 waiting for Xvfb readiness.
The [source-traced init control](../troubleshooting/xvfb-run-container-init.md)
records the parent-signal boundary and successful `--init` child-launch
control.
The subsequent full guest attempt passed that wrapper boundary but
terminated on `SIGSEGV` before readiness.
Those are separate failures.

The current bounded control keeps that init configuration and selects the
installed emulator's documented `swangle` backend,
using ANGLE with SwiftShader rather than the prior GLES path.
That control booted and reported ANGLE with SwiftShader,
but its first cover capture was blocked by a Pixel Launcher ANR.
Recorded fields were restored and the runtime exited cleanly.
It is not a graphics-stability or cover-verification pass.

The next bounded renderer control exposes the host's existing render node
and requests `-gpu host` with the same native-library environment and caps.
The actual adapter output is
`llvmpipe (LLVM 20.1.2, 256 bits)`.
Exposing the render node did not establish hardware rendering;
this remains a software-rendered native-library control.
The earlier host request resolved to LLVM22 llvmpipe in the different
library environment.
This native-library/LLVM20 control passed all four cover contexts:
light/dark at 100%/200% text,
auto expiry,
manual dismissal,
Undo/log intent,
full diagnostic read-back and unchanged player geometry.
Recorded fields were restored and the owner exited cleanly.
The successful bounded run is not an isolated root-cause diagnosis.
Final held-pose acquisition now keeps this configuration fixed,
with actual adapter,
library environment,
image fingerprint and measured system insets in each new record.
Exact unowned fresh-AVD locks were preserved after positive owner checks;
no original AVD or third-party source was changed.

## Independently verifiable queue

- [x] Inspect the accepted dark error/toast candidates,
  current operation owners and token roles.
  Completion requires distinguishing known missing-file signals,
  failed trash operations and actual Undo capability from invented
  recovery actions.
- [ ] Build isolated native light/dark authored states for error only,
  Undo only and the combined state,
  preserving D8/D9/D29 as revised by D83 and accepted player information clearance.
  Completion requires fit and overlap evidence at both panels and native
  font scales,
  not a live filesystem mutation.
- [ ] Publish inspected,
  sanitized state evidence and verify its consumer review.
  Record implementation limits and restore/stop any owned runtime.
  Ask only if a consequential unresolved requirement survives the audit.

## Safety and evidence boundary

No real file is trashed,
restored,
renamed or deleted.
No live playback,
source scan,
original-AVD change or new IME/TalkBack experiment is authorized.
An authored successful-trash state cannot prove that production Undo can
restore the original identity or location.
A failed trash request does not qualify for a successful-trash toast.
Unknown failure causes do not receive an invented generic Retry action.

The human now authorizes installing and provisioning fresh Pixel 9 Fold
emulators and acquiring other system images as needed.
This supersedes the restriction to reusing `Fold_No_Hardware_Probe`.
Keep original user AVDs untouched and preserve the rejected guest evidence.
Native visits retain 6GiB/2CPU bounds;
browser checks stay within 2GiB/2CPU.
The existing first-run debug host disables production entry points and
services and can supply the same isolation boundary for this study.
Raw status-bearing images,
hierarchies and logs remain private.

## Initial source anchors

`package/music-player/design/decisions.md` sections D8,
D9 and D29 retain outcome/placement context;
D83 is the current non-reserving presentation authority.
`package/music-player/design/candidates/err-b.dc.html` and
`package/music-player/design/candidates/toast-a.dc.html` are historical
accepted dark treatments to inspect,
not a current source-operation proof.
`package/music-player/design/open-questions.md` section 11d lists the light error bar and
Undo toast as undrawn.

## Current presentation authority

D83 supersedes the layout-reserving error bar.
The accepted replacement is a floating,
auto-dismissing and manually dismissible toast/snackbar.
Target two visible message lines;
when further detail would require more lines,
direct the user to capture Android logs rather than enlarge the notice.
Keep full operation details in tagged diagnostics.
The player,
folder browser and deck must not resize when feedback appears,
expires or is dismissed.
Truthful outcome gating and the restoration-handle boundary remain unchanged.

All bar-family captures,
height correction experiments and resize/drop witnesses recorded in this
plan are superseded presentation evidence,
not the accepted overlay implementation.
No older artifact is relabelled.
Prototype `2d67822ce` replaces the feedback bottomBar with independent
native snackbar hosts inside the measured viewport overlay.
`4c5f0cc67` bases transition separation on rendered host heights,
retains failure meaning in the brief fallback and logs actual rendered
message line/overflow metrics.
The default path uses native `Short` duration;
an explicit false-default capture hold is a debug static pose only,
not auto-dismiss evidence.
No feedback is part of Scaffold's player-space allocation.
The first overlay APK build passed.
The nine pure message tests and fresh third-line/overflow guard-removal
controls passed,
including exact restoration and the complete unit task.

The updated nine message tests and complete unit task passed with the
multiline/non-ASCII diagnostic fixture;
the outcome fixture report now contains 16 passing cases.
Fresh third-line and overflow mutants failed the intended tests,
followed by exact restoration.
The current overlay APK built from `c890d09b0` is retained with SHA-256
`7d359b9b6d624788e474d916109f2217bf5d644e797da4fb2ea70c4c6690a671`.
The new owned SwiftShader runtime reached authorized readiness and recorded
a separate original-settings snapshot under the unchanged 6 GiB/2 CPU caps.
An observed startup System UI ANR was dismissed before focused acquisition;
no blocked frame is accepted as application evidence.

The next action is focused native lifecycle/fit/log read-back verification,
not another policy or cosmetic questionnaire.
The focused cover/light/200% held poses were inspected:
error copy remains bounded,
independent Undo/error surfaces fit over the list,
and long detail keeps a concise failure statement plus the Android-log
direction.
The native log-intent callback fired;
these held poses do not prove expiry.

The first inner/light/100% lifecycle control reached manual dismissal,
Undo action completion and automatic expiry,
with identical measured root and track viewport.
A pixel comparator incorrectly included the separately animated system
navigation region:
its first differing pixel was at `y=2108`,
outside the measured player root ending at `2074px`.
The corrected comparator uses measured application bounds and explicit
notice/shadow exclusions;
raw frames remain unchanged for independent recheck.
No exclusion is made for ordinary player content.
The offline recheck passed for `3743106` application pixels outside the
notice/shadow union in each retained manual/final/expiry comparison.

A source audit of the accepted 7.5mm player route found the new study was
not passing its inner information inset to `SearchPlayerPreview`.
That selected the historical fixed-pane branch instead of the accepted
E2 equal-surface composition.
The study now passes the existing `12dp` information-only inset used by
the accepted closed-player route.
Cover ignores that inner inset.
The first overlay APK remains diagnostic evidence,
not the final accepted-player publication artifact.
Corrected artifact identity and new native evidence are required.
The corrected E2 overlay build is `743c5b378` with APK SHA-256
`2b556131d86e39acb8ebcf194f39da9ed8e36e2f146a86ab4fb971f4c8f06480`.
It is separately retained from the fixed-pane diagnostic APK.

Readiness and input are not assumed synchronous:
a failed preflight observed a named System UI ANR still owning focus
immediately after a close command.
Another snapshot helper exceeded its short command bound despite receiving
`0` on stdout;
that partial result was not promoted to a completed read.
The bounded stage now verifies window settling before acquisition and
retains rejected frame/window/log evidence on a focus mismatch.
Each native stage restores original fields and requests graceful shutdown
in its cleanup path.
No rejected preflight is counted as a fit or lifecycle witness.
The retained diagnostic visit showed System UI owning an ANR window while
`dumpsys activity lastanr` said no ANR had occurred since boot.
Both observations are retained without treating the latter as proof of
absence.
The authored app logged entry and E2 root/viewport layout,
but that does not establish app health or a System UI root cause.
Console shutdown was accepted after recorded fields were restored;
that owner later ended with status `137` and shutdown diagnostics,
so a clean exit is not claimed.
Matching-runtime absence was verified separately.

One targeted preflight now uses the independently proven local gRPC touch
bridge for the fresh hierarchy's named System UI close action,
rediscovering current metadata and port rather than reusing a PID/token.
It requires subsequent window settling and stable owned focus.
The hardware-input attempt was rejected by an over-eager warm-up guard.
Its supposed repeated ANR had the same retained window identity in both
reads;
a subsequent diagnostic read showed `LightFeedbackActivity` already
owning focus.
That evidence does not establish a new ANR recurrence.
The guard now gives the same closing window a bounded settling interval
without additional input and rejects a different ANR window explicitly.
Recorded settings were restored and the owner exited cleanly;
absence was checked before the corrected readiness control.
The next retained rejection identified a different startup blocker:
`Application Not Responding: com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher`.
It is not silently classified as the System UI incident.
The preflight now recognizes only those two observed system-package
ANR windows,
retains each fresh hierarchy/screenshot,
and permits at most two distinct named close actions before rejecting the
visit.
The same already-closing window gets settling time,
not repeated input.
No recovery is performed after accepted evidence acquisition begins.

If the proven input bridge and bounded known-dialog readiness check cannot establish
a usable runtime,
retain the native-verification blocker rather than repeating blind boots.
The owned runtime is restored/stopped before the next bounded visit,
rather than left near its measured 6 GiB memory ceiling.
Same-scene player-geometry equality needs a changing-geometry positive
control before any new held capture cohort.
Log capture remains a named debug intent here,
not an implemented export or successful storage recovery.
The original selected Search review,
D81 templates and D82 standard notifications remain unchanged.

## Completed source/operation audit

The historical `err-b` and `toast-a` files were read completely.
They predate the accepted native Fold composition and still contain
superseded track ordinals,
play markers,
in-app volume and sub-48dp controls.
Carry D8/D9/D29's behavioral requirements,
not those obsolete implementation details,
into the native study.
The historical six-second demo timer is not an accepted universal Undo
interval or an accessibility timeout policy.

A source search across Android main Kotlin,
desktop Rust and Slint found no implemented trash/Undo UI action;
the literal Undo hits were unrelated comments.
`PlayerUiState` exposes no error/Undo outcome field.
These are inspected-source limits,
not proof that every platform or dependency path lacks such capability.

`MainActivity.kt:1670` currently persists only the chosen tree's read grant.
That does not establish permission to trash or restore its documents.
The installed API37 `MediaStore.java:2027` to `2071` documents
`createTrashRequest` as request generation:
it displays a system prompt,
then applies `IS_TRASHED` after approval,
and finishes the operation before delivering `RESULT_OK`.
Request generation or pending approval is not successful trash.
The same API with `false` requests removal from trash.
The current [shared-media guide][shared-media] corroborates the separate
access and operation boundaries.

The installed API37 source also exposes flagged path-based `trashFile`
and `restoreFileFromTrash` methods,
requiring declared and granted `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`.
The current app manifest declares neither that permission nor
`MANAGE_MEDIA`.
Their SDK declarations establish neither availability in the captured
runtime nor a reason to adopt broader access.
No special storage access is selected or requested here.

`DocumentsContract.java:576` marks deletability,
while `deleteDocument` invokes provider deletion.
That operation is not documented as a reversible trash/restore contract.
Provider deletion capability alone supplies no Undo owner.
The source audit does not claim Android universally requires one prompt
or universally forbids direct operations;
current ownership and grants matter.
D8 does not authorize bypassing OS consent or falsely reporting success.

## Fixture implementation in progress

The owned debug worktree now has exact missing,
Undo,
combined,
failed-trash and pending-trash fixtures.
A successful Undo fixture requires explicitly authored per-item
`verified-success`,
a restoration handle and a live interval.
`approved-but-unverified` is neither pending nor a known failure;
it cannot borrow successful-trash feedback.
The retired `completed` token is rejected rather than silently acquiring
that stronger meaning.
Failed,
cancelled,
pending,
expired and missing-handle controls reject successful Undo feedback.
The combined state separates three unavailable-file outcomes from one
successfully trashed authored row.
No file is actually changed.

The native renderer and overlap/fit evidence are still pending.
Prototype `5a7232914` commits the original fixture;
`d266f3664` separates accepted requests from per-item verified success.
The revised 15 host-JVM tests passed,
and fresh unknown-scene,
pending and accepted-but-unverified mutants failed their intended tests.
Exact restoration and the complete unit task passed in `proc_9e67`.

Comparable MediaProvider revision
`a183e2b92c71d86ec7b104c116ef3f4dbcbb523f`
was inspected read-only.
Its positive task can set `RESULT_OK` after batch operations whose per-item
results are not checked,
including a caught exception path.
This is not proved equivalent to the installed image or an observed
provider failure.
The source demonstrates why request acceptance/completion does not supply
that fixture's stronger per-item success premise.
[The operation boundary](../troubleshooting/android-trash-request-outcome-boundary.md)
retains exact source excerpts,
dialog-skipping conditions and limits.

Prototype `36ea4fa46` adds the isolated `LightFeedbackActivity`,
renderer,
feedback surfaces and private native-layout measurements.
Existing player routes retain default-empty row omissions and no measurement
modifier;
the feedback route names its authored omissions while retaining source
indices and the complete shared folder/deck renderer.
Undo emits only a debug intent and does not return a row or report recovery.
Dismiss changes only local error-bar presentation.
The error bar explicitly owns its navigation inset;
Scaffold content padding is not assumed to protect custom bottom-bar controls.

The bounded APK build passed in `proc_7d1d`.
The fresh merged manifest retains the isolated host,
disables production entry/services and removes automatic WorkManager
initialization.
The retained APK SHA-256 is
`523573ee2937200c74135751b36fe84fe56ad9bc17dc1f89132c125c8193f121`.
No native light-feedback capture or artifact acceptance is claimed yet.

The first owned emulator attempt aborted before guest readiness with
`Failed to find memory type for ColorBuffers.`
The obsolete boot watch was stopped and container/matching-emulator
absence checked.
The explicit `-feature -Vulkan` attempt then exited before guest readiness
with the distinct multiple-instance FATAL.
That lock rejection does not establish the override's effect on graphics.
Validated `lsof` and `fuser` positive controls,
nonempty `lslocks` output and empty matching process/container checks
preceded joint quarantine of only the exact owned `hardware-qemu.ini.lock`
and `multiinstance.lock` files.
Their private backup is retained;
no original AVD or arbitrary lock was changed.

The post-quarantine runtime remained live under its measured caps,
but the readiness watch failed on `adb: device unauthorized`.
That is not a successful read proving incomplete guest boot.
Owning-container console help remained reachable and accepted graceful
shutdown;
an absence watch must finish before any restart.
No guest settings were changed through the unauthorized transport and no
fresh settings snapshot or application frame was captured.

Fresh installed metadata and the running emitter identify Android Emulator
`37.2.12.0`,
build `16428233`;
the historical `37.1.11` attribution does not apply to this visit.
Read-only comparable gfxstream revision
`07ee40efb0e7037a9a9b7fe59071e7c4997e7cbe`
traces the allocation/probe/fatal sequence,
not source/binary equivalence or a proved allocator cause.
[The graphics and transport boundary](../troubleshooting/android-emulator-container-color-buffer-allocation.md)
retains those separate outcomes.

The owning runtime exited cleanly and its absence watch passed.
The `-skip-adb-auth` attempt still reported an unauthorized guest transport;
that flag is not a verified authorization workaround.
An independent console screenshot showed a separate System UI ANR.
Authenticated local gRPC touch removed that dialog,
providing a visible input positive control;
a console mouse command's `OK` alone had not shown the intended change.
Neither observation establishes the ANR's cause or ADB authorization.

The measured container network is isolated `pasta` and its ADB server
used `HOME=/tmp`.
A container-local server restart and reconnect retained unauthorized
transport and showed no RSA approval dialog in the inspected frames.
Only this runtime's generated key pair was retained in private mode-restricted
storage for one bounded persistent-identity retry.
No original host key,
original AVD or guest authorization file is copied or changed.
The current runtime accepted graceful console shutdown;
`proc_3ef7` verifies absence before that last retry.
The final persistent-owned-identity retry displayed the actual
`Allow USB debugging?` prompt.
Its fingerprint matched the retained runtime-generated public key.
Authenticated gRPC input selected `Always allow from this computer`
and `Allow`;
ADB then reported `device`,
`sys.boot_completed=1` and the correct `Fold_No_Hardware_Probe` identity.
`proc_0e8c` retained the fresh settings snapshot and validated the 6 GiB/2 CPU
bounds.
The guest transport is no longer a blocker.
The cover/light/200% combined and failed-trash fit controls captured in
`proc_7ccb`.
Both raw frames were inspected:
error copy,
Dismiss and the complete deck remain visible;
the combined Undo-bearing surface is over the list.
The final combined layout event records viewport bottom `979px` and toast
bottom `940px`,
a `39px` separation matching `16dp` at `390dpi`.
This is a bounded layout observation,
not native activation,
ink bounds,
universal fit or actual operation/recovery acceptance.
The initial panel/theme/font attempt retained nine inner/100% frames
before the owning emulator segfaulted with status `139`.
The capture task's separate terminal diagnostic was a bounded
`am force-stop` transport timeout.
No complete manifest or full-cohort acceptance exists for that partial
attempt and its artifacts remain private.
The emitter reported OpenGL ES Translator over
`llvmpipe (LLVM 22.1.8, 256 bits)` despite the requested `-gpu host` option.
No usable coredump was found for this visit;
nearby null-context messages do not establish the crash's deciding call.

The current SDK's freshly exercised GPU help advertises `swiftshader`.
A bounded current-37.2.12 software-renderer probe is starting with the
same owned AVD,
retained generated identity and 6 GiB/2 CPU bounds.
The historical 37.1.11 SwiftShader failure is not treated as proof about
this different installed build.
The original settings snapshot remains unchanged;
a new renderer's startup snapshot is separate.
The current SwiftShader probe reached authorized guest readiness and a
separate startup snapshot in `proc_0c26`.
The emitter explicitly reports Google SwiftShader;
the original restoration snapshot remains unchanged.
The first SwiftShader acquisition attempt rejected a renamed private-root
path before installation or any frame:
Node reported `ENOENT` for the absent settings path.
The consumer harness path is corrected without changing the emulator,
APK or original snapshot.
The renewed acquisition's scene guard rejected the first frame because a
System UI ANR owned window focus.
Private screenshot and focused-window evidence identify that overlay;
the underlying authored `missing` scene had entered and logged layout.
The inspected overlay was dismissed through owned ADB input before a
new acquisition attempt.
This does not identify the ANR's cause or permit silent dismissal during
capture.
Renderer/build provenance and final post-stability layout diagnostics
remain required;
The complete 40-state SwiftShader initial cohort finished in `proc_868c`.
Exact layout checks passed for every record,
including measured 48dp action floors and 16dp toast owner separation.
App-area cropping removes the measured system-status extent,
retains exact RGB,
checks opacity and essential PNG chunks,
and preserves exact hashes.
The inner/light/100% five-state image group has been inspected;
remaining groups and publication are still pending.

The native interaction run verified Undo intent and Dismiss movement in
inner/light/100%,
inner/dark/100% and inner/light/200% contexts.
Each Undo callback fired once without changing retained presentation;
each Dismiss callback fired once,
removed the error bar and showed measured viewport/toast expansion.
The owning SwiftShader process was subsequently killed with status `137`,
and the next hierarchy read rejected `device offline`.
That is not the host-renderer `SIGSEGV` incident.
The subsequently corrected kernel-journal probe identifies
`CONSTRAINT_MEMCG` for the exact owning container and
`Memory cgroup out of memory: Killed process` for its QEMU process.
The contained memory-limit kill is now established;
a renderer leak,
click-specific cause or general host exhaustion is not.
The separate original restoration snapshot remains pending restoration.

A fresh bounded visit with the retained granted identity is reserved for
the remaining five native contexts and explicit restoration/read-back.
The remaining five native controls passed in `proc_d9e9`,
completing eight measured intent/Dismiss contexts for that APK.
Original recorded settings were restored/read back exactly,
the owner exited cleanly,
and absence was verified.
No earlier base/override configuration equality is claimed.

A final standards check found a missed D29 baseline constraint:
the Undo button was `48dp`,
but row-level vertical padding made the baseline surface
`64.41025641025641dp`.
The earlier geometry guard checked action floors and edge separation,
not total toast baseline height.
Those checks and the eight intents remain narrow evidence for the prior
APK,
not complete D29 compliance.
The strengthened height guard rejects the retained baseline with
`Authored baseline Undo surface is not 48dp`.
Independent review confirmed the toast-height subject and inspected source
shows baseline `48dp`/single-line guidance without a required outer
vertical inset.
No settled design question is reopened.

Prototype `660f66a46` moves vertical clearance into the message,
preserving native button padding,
48dp action floors and large-font growth.
The corrected APK build passed;
its retained identity and new original-settings snapshot are separate from
the previous artifacts.
The next action is the corrected native cohort,
height/glyph checks and fresh intent/Dismiss controls before publication.
No old capture is relabelled as the new artifact.
The first corrected-artifact boot watch targeted the old first-run
container name and rejected `no such container`;
the actual owned runtime independently reports authorized `device`.
This is a consumer-watch target mistake,
not a renewed ADB grant failure or a proved guest boot failure.
The watch target is corrected without restarting the emulator or changing
its retained granted identity.
Boot success does not prove that the earlier graphics failure is fixed.
New capture and interaction evidence still gates publication.

The human correction identified a workflow gap:
prioritize an available owned-device authorization prompt and verify its
matching key/transport before repeating boot watches.
This expected-action clarification stays in this plan;
no `AGENTS.md` edit is made this round.
The next action is the prepared cover/200% combined and failed-trash fit
controls,
then measured layout/interaction checks and the independent capture cohort.
The prepared cover/200% combined and failed-trash fit controls still run
before any full capture cohort.
Verification must establish stable fresh root/viewport rectangles,
LTR configuration,
finite contained overlay geometry,
measured action layout floors,
visible copy and per-scene row omissions.
Same-environment no-feedback and toast-only controls are required before
claiming unchanged player geometry;
post-Dismiss frames require new layout readiness checks.
Semantic rectangles remain distinct from visible ink and pointer activation.
Real storage actions and new IME/TalkBack work remain outside this study.
No user answer or new production permission request is blocking these
remaining authorized design steps.
The first-run captured APK and source revision remain immutable;
new builds are a separate light-feedback cohort.
