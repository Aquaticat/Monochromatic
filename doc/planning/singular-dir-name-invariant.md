# Singular dir names and the package name path invariant

Status: executed 2026-07-15, all eleven batches landed.
Decisions below were made by the user during a grilling session on 2026-07-15.
Deviations and residue are recorded at the end of this doc.

## Motivation and reframing

The original request was "remove all trailing `s` from dir names".
Grilling surfaced the real motivation:
`package.json` names should equal the package path with `/` replaced by `-`.

Measured state at decision time:
135 workspace packages, 28 name/path mismatches.
Only 6 mismatches were trailing-`s` problems;
the other 22 had names whose category segment differed from the dir entirely
(`pi-*` under `pi-plugins/`, `config-oxlint-*` under `oxlint-plugins/`, `cli-git` under `git-policies/`).
A literal strip would also have created roughly 30 new mismatches
by breaking currently-matching plural pairs such as `claude-code-plugins-*`.

The plan is therefore two goals, not one:

- Invariant: every npm workspace package satisfies
  `name === '@monochromatic-dev/' + <path relative to the workspace packages root>.replaceAll('/', '-')`.
- Full retroactive depluralization of repo-controlled dir names,
  with dir and package name renamed in lockstep so the invariant never breaks.

## Decisions

- Rule formulation is "repo-chosen dir segments are singular nouns",
  never a literal "no trailing `s`":
  `harness` is singular yet ends in `s`, `css`/`rss` are acronyms, `throws` is a verb.
- Terms of art keep their plural, external and repo-coined alike:
  `dotfiles`, `import-attributes`, `no-exports` (the `package.json` `exports` field),
  `forbidden-strings` (tool identity: CLI, packages, `forbidden-strings.append.local.txt`),
  `jetbrains` (brand).
- Skill directory names are skill identities (`testing-practices`, `css`) and stay unchanged.
- Tool-mandated dir names stay unchanged:
  `.github/workflows`, `.claude/skills`, `.agents/skills`, `.factory/skills`, `.crush/*`,
  Cargo `tests/`, cargo-fuzz `fuzz_targets/`, `corpus/`, `artifacts/`,
  `LICENSES/` (REUSE), `share/applications` (XDG), KWin `contents/`,
  `.idea/`, `node_modules/`, build outputs.
- Plugin families use a uniform singular `-plugin` suffix:
  `pi-plugin/`, `claude-code-plugin/`, `intellij-plugin/`, `rolldown-plugin/`, `oxlint-plugin/`.
- `oxlint-plugins/*` packages are renamed `config-oxlint-*` to `oxlint-plugin-*`;
  `packages/config/oxlint` keeps its name and updates its dependencies and re-exports.
- `figma-parsers/` becomes `figma/`;
  leaf `penpot` becomes `to-penpot` so `figma-kiwi` and `figma-to-penpot` need no name change.
  The old category name was already wrong for the Penpot converter, which is not a parser.
- `git-policies/` becomes `git-policy/`.
  The guard CLI stays at `git-policy/cli` and its name changes from `cli-git` to `git-policy-cli`;
  the bin name `git` is untouched.
  `AGENTS.md` rules GCW and CLG update their `cli-git` mentions and the cited source path.
- `agent-harnesses-shared/` becomes `agent-harness-shared/`;
  all six member packages take `agent-harness-shared-*` names,
  including the two previously named `module-current-time-context` and `module-terminal-title`.
- Rust crate names are out of scope.
  Crate names are binary identities (`file-manager`, `terminal`),
  none are published, and path-derived names would worsen user-facing binaries.
- Enforcement is documentation only:
  two new tagged `AGENTS.md` rules, no file-enforcer check.
  (Recommendation during grilling was a file-enforcer check for the mechanical invariant;
  the user chose rules only.)
- Execution is per-family batches, each verified and committed before the next;
  auto-push is on, so every batch must be green.

## Rename inventory

Counts are from the decision-time measurement; re-enumerate before each batch.

### Package name renames (38)

- `pi-plugins/*` to `pi-plugin/*`: 12 names `pi-*` to `pi-plugin-*`;
  leaf `thinking-defaults` becomes `thinking-default`.
- `claude-code-plugins/*` to `claude-code-plugin/*`: 11 names;
  leaves `stop-reminders` and `hook-types` become `stop-reminder` and `hook-type`.
- `oxlint-plugins/*` to `oxlint-plugin/*`: 6 names `config-oxlint-*` to `oxlint-plugin-*`.
- `agent-harnesses-shared/*` to `agent-harness-shared/*`: 6 names.
- `git-policies/cli`: `cli-git` to `git-policy-cli`.
- `module/llm-types` to `module/llm-type`: `module-llm-types` to `module-llm-type`.
- `test-fixture/data-sequences` to `data-sequence`.

### Dir moves with no name change

- `figma-parsers/kiwi` to `figma/kiwi`; `figma-parsers/penpot` to `figma/to-penpot`.
- `rolldown-plugins/` to `rolldown-plugin/`.
- `intellij-plugins/` to `intellij-plugin/`.
- `ownership-markers/` to `ownership-marker/`.
- `git-policies/` to `git-policy/` (`api`, `repository`, `forbidden-strings` already named `git-policy-*`).

### Root and non-package dirs

- `packages/` to `package/` (final batch; see risks).
- `packages-deprecated/` to `package-deprecated/`.
- `docs/` to `doc/`;
  plural families `agents`, `decisions`, `limitations` singularize;
  nested plurals (`*-vet-reports`, `tools`) singularize.
- 50 `src`-internal plural dirs singularize:
  `rules`, `fixtures`, `handlers`, `parsers`, `operators`, `backends`, `filters`,
  `stubs`, `scripts`, `errors`, `types`, `components`, `styles`, `sessions`,
  `screenshots`, `pages`, `assets`, `seeds`, `dictionaries`, and peers.
  Line-item vetoes (for example `assets`, `pages`) are welcome before that batch runs.

### Explicitly unchanged

Everything in the exemption decisions:
tool-mandated dirs, terms of art, skill identities, acronyms, non-plural `s`-enders,
and all Rust crate names.

## New AGENTS.md rule

One merged rule, `SGD` (the user folded the planned `PNP` into it):
dir segments singular;
package name equals `@monochromatic-dev/` plus the package path with `/` replaced by `-`;
rename dir, name, and consumers together.
This doc is the rule's exemption inventory:
tool-mandated names, acronyms, skill identities,
established terms of art (`dotfiles`, `forbidden-strings`, `import-attributes`).

## Batch order

1.   This plan doc plus the two `AGENTS.md` rules; regenerate `CLAUDE.md` via file-enforcer.
2.   `src`-internal singularization, one commit per `packages/<category>`.
3.   Small families: `figma/`, `ownership-marker/`, `rolldown-plugin/`, `intellij-plugin/`.
4.   `git-policy/` including the `git-policy-cli` rename and GCW/CLG updates.
5.   `oxlint-plugin/` including `config/oxlint` consumers and the TSD rule mention.
6.   `agent-harness-shared/`.
7.   Leaf renames: `module/llm-type`, `test-fixture/data-sequence`.
8.   `pi-plugin/`.
9.   `claude-code-plugin/`, updating hook paths in harness config in the same commit;
     restart live sessions afterwards.
10.  `docs/` to `doc/`, updating `AGENTS.md` rules DPL, RBK, SK1 to SK3, DL1 to DL3
     and every skill file referencing `docs/` paths.
11.  `packages/` to `package/` and `packages-deprecated/` to `package-deprecated/`:
     `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, every `//packages/` mise address, `file-enforcer.config.ts` globs,
     workflows, `DEFAULT_ALLOWED_WORKTREE_DIRS` in the git guard,
     forbidden-strings config, `slopo.conf.yaml`.

## Per-batch procedure

- `git mv`; sweep old identifiers and paths with uncapped `rg` and sanity-check the sweep ran.
- Check new names against `forbidden-strings.append.local.txt` before adopting them.
- Update `package.json` names, `workspace:*` consumers, imports, tsconfig references.
- `pnpm install` to regenerate the lockfile; never hand-edit it.
- `mise run //package-path:lint:types` and tests for every touched package.
- Exercise user-facing artifacts at the boundary:
  hooks through the host harness, `git-policy-cli` via its real bin.
- Commit with explicit scoped pathspecs in the multi-package message format.

Proposed handling of renamed-away names:
add forbidden-strings entries for the ten retired category-level identifiers
(`pi-plugins`, `claude-code-plugins`, `oxlint-plugins`, `agent-harnesses-shared`,
`figma`, `git-policies`, `intellij-plugin`, `rolldown-plugin`,
`ownership-marker`, `cli-git`)
rather than one entry per package name.

## Risks

- Hook configs reference `claude-code-plugins` build outputs by path;
  the batch that moves them breaks live hooks until config updates land,
  and running sessions need a restart.
- User-global harness config outside the repo may reference `packages/` paths;
  report anything found rather than editing silently.
- Historical handover and decision docs mention old names heavily;
  the sweep updates them so docs stay canonical, with this doc recording the mapping.
- The final `packages/` rename changes every mise task address;
  open terminals and muscle memory go stale at once.

## Execution deviations and residue

- The guard CLI's runtime identifiers stay `cli-git`
  (`cli-git.config.ts` discovery name, `.git/cli-git-transaction`,
  JSONL prefixes, logger tags, the `git cli-git` management subcommand):
  renaming them would invalidate user-global trust registries.
- Marketplace plugin `name` fields in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` stay:
  they are installed-plugin identities, like skill names.
- The rust linter's implementations dir became `src/builtin`
  (not `src/rule`) because `rule.rs` already owned the singular name.
- The `seeds` to `seed` rename initially bypassed the hardcoded final-newline
  exclusion prefix and the policy appended newlines to 3374 fuzz seed files;
  exclusions were updated and the corpus bytes restored, verified byte-identical.
- `package-paused/` internals keep their plural dirs: the tree is
  workspace-inert and frozen; only stale renamed-package references were swept.
- Forbidden-strings entries for retired identifiers were skipped by user decision.
- The `dev-script-file-enforcer` generated-policy-contracts test fails for a
  preexisting reason unrelated to the renames:
  commit b979593d5 (readonly-rule findings sweep, earlier the same day)
  removed the lazy-provider mutation contract from canonical policy sources
  while the test still asserts it; verified via git log -S.
- User-global configs updated: `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` plugin paths and
  `~/.claude/settings.json` statusline path point at `package/...`.
