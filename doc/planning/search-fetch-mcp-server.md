# Repackage pi search fetch as an MCP server

Status: implemented and verified.
This records the interview state, measured evidence, and the implementation record.

## Goal

The user asked to repackage the pi search fetch plugin (`package/pi-plugin/search-fetch`) as an MCP server too,
and to grill the plan before any code moves.

## Settled decisions

- Q1: additive MCP surface aimed at non-pi MCP hosts; the pi extension stays the pi-native path.
- Q2: extract a pi-free core package; both the pi extension and the MCP server become thin adapters.
- Q4: full behavioral parity for `web_search` and `web_fetch`, blocklist included and non-negotiable.
- Q5: keep the tool names `web_search` and `web_fetch`, plus a documented one-surface-per-host rule.
- Q3: valibot single source in core, guarded valibot to TypeBox transform for the pi adapter;
  `@monochromatic-dev/mcp-stdio` stays unchanged.
- Q10: the transform is a dependency-free in-repo subset converter with a fail-loud guard
  and verdict-agreement tests; no third-party converter is adopted.
- Q6: core lives at `package/agent-harness-shared/search-fetch`,
  named `@monochromatic-dev/agent-harness-shared-search-fetch`.
- Q7: truncation is ported into a neutral module and proven identical to pi's helpers by behavior tests;
  core imports nothing from pi.
- Q8: truncated head plus temp path stay, and the full response is additionally delivered as an MCP resource.
  New evidence (OpenCodeReview ignores resources) reopens the delivery mechanism as Q11.
- Q9: README snippets cover generic stdio and open-codereview.ai only;
  live verification runs against OpenCodeReview (`ocr` on PATH), configured by the agent.

Recorded without asking (policy or sibling precedent), each open for veto:

- `package/mcp/search-fetch` named `@monochromatic-dev/mcp-search-fetch`, bin `search-fetch-mcp`,
  `#!/usr/bin/env node` first line, `private: true`, `LGPL-3.0-or-later` with `LICENSES/`.
- stdio transport only, on `@monochromatic-dev/mcp-stdio`; logs to stderr through tagged `module-logger` loggers.
- `mise.toml` tasks mirroring siblings, tests covering every exported path, package `README.md`.
- Workspace imports through the `/ts` subpath.
- Tool specs (name, description, behavior bullets, schemas) declared once in core;
  pi-only `label` and `promptSnippet` stay in the pi adapter, MCP `instructions` in the MCP adapter.
- The pi plugin slims to a thin adapter; only `package/config/pnpr/config.yaml` references it from outside.
- Schema strictness is behavior: the shared schema must stay an open object so `collectIgnoredKeys`
  keeps warning on ignored `web_fetch` knobs instead of the host rejecting them.

- Q9: README snippets cover generic stdio and open-codereview.ai only;
  live verification runs against OpenCodeReview (`ocr` on PATH), configured by the agent.
- Q11: full response delivery is both mechanisms: an inline `resource_link` in the tool result
  and a dynamic resource via `resources/list` plus `resources/read`, with the resource URI in the text output.
- Q12: the truncation port lives in its own package `package/agent-harness-shared/truncate`,
  named `@monochromatic-dev/agent-harness-shared-truncate`, differential-tested against pi's helpers
  with pi in devDependencies only.
- Q13: no `AGENTS.md` edit; the user enforces the rg rule another way.

## Open frontier

Empty.
The design tree is fully visited; implementation waits for the user's confirmation of the shared understanding.

## Evidence

### Pi tool contract

- `ToolDefinition<TParams extends TSchema ...>` types `parameters` as TypeBox
  (`node_modules/.pnpm/@earendil-works+pi-coding-agent@1.0.2_supports-color@10.2.2/node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent/dist/core/extensions/types.d.ts:439`).
- The pi example tool declares `parameters: Type.Object({...})`
  (`.../examples/extensions/hello.ts:7`).
- Pi compiles and validates tool arguments with TypeBox before coercion (`CHANGELOG.md:819`, `CHANGELOG.md:902`);
  nested tool calls go through the same argument validation (`docs/extensions.md:148`).
- Consequence: handing pi plain JSON Schema is rejected.
  Auto-transforming valibot into real TypeBox builder output is a different mechanism and is untested by that rejection.

### Valibot to TypeBox transform probe

Probe: `/var/home/user/temp/agent/search-fetch-schema-probe/probe.mjs`, output `out.txt`, run 2026-10-02.
It mirrors both tool parameter schemas in valibot and transforms them with `@sinclair/typemap` `TypeBoxFromValibot`.

- Transformed schemas compile under `typebox@1.3.34`, the TypeBox generation pi validates with.
- Verdicts agree with valibot on every case probed: valid input passes, missing required fails,
  wrong type fails, unknown key passes on `v.object`, single string for an array fails.
- Descriptions survive the transform, so model-facing text is intact.
- `v.strictObject` maps to `additionalProperties: false`, `v.object` maps to an open object.
  The valibot source must therefore use `v.object` to preserve today's ignored-key warning behavior.
- Untranslatable constructs degrade silently instead of throwing.
  `v.custom` and `v.variant` produced invalid JSON Schema carrying embedded valibot internals.
  Any transform needs a fail-loud guard, and `typebox/guard` exists for that.

### Library candidates (named at discovery, none vetted or recommended)

- `@sinclair/typemap@0.10.1`: MIT, peer `@sinclair/typebox@^0.34` while this workspace uses `typebox@1.3.x`;
  npm reports the package deprecated (install warning), a likely hard-gate failure.
- `@traversable/valibot@0.0.26` and `@traversable/typebox@0.0.31`: MIT, pre-1.0, not yet vetted.
- In-repo subset converter: no dependency, covers exactly the constructs we use (object, string,
  array, optional, pipe description), throws on anything else.

### OpenCodeReview MCP integration

Source of truth: `open-code-review` repo, `pages/src/content/docs/en/mcp.md`, `pages/src/content/docs/en/tools.md`,
`internal/mcp/client.go` (cloned at `/home/user/temp/agent/open-code-review-ocr-routing-20260823`).

- OCR is an MCP client over stdio using `github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk v1.6.1` (`go.mod:12`).
- Servers are configured under `mcp_servers.<name>` in `~/.opencodereview/config.json`, writable via
  `ocr config set mcp_servers.<name>.command|args|tools|setup|env`; `tools` is an optional allowlist.
- Tool names share a namespace with built-ins (`task_done`, `code_comment`, `file_read`, `file_read_diff`,
  `file_find`, `code_search`). `web_search` and `web_fetch` collide with none of them.
- `CallTool` returns text only (`internal/mcp/client.go:157`); `contentToText` keeps `*mcp.TextContent` and renders
  every other content type as `[unsupported content type: %T]` (`internal/mcp/client.go:177`).
  Repo-wide `resource` hits are OpenTelemetry and CSP only, so OCR never follows MCP resources.
- Consequence: the Q8 resource is inert in the verification host, and inline resource content would add a
  placeholder line to its review context.

### Evidence hygiene

The user corrected a wrong claim: I reported a nonexistent bash output filter rewriting terms to `ln`.
Cause was my own `rg -rln` / `rg -rn` misuse (`-r` is `--replace`), the failure mode `AGENTS.md` `RGT` warns about.
Re-verified after the correction: `docs/extensions.md:76` says `pi.registerTool()`, not `pi.ln()`;
the OCR README link is `docs/mcp`; and no conclusion in this document rests on replaced output.

## Rejected ideas

- Declare once in valibot, convert to plain JSON Schema, hand it to pi behind a cast.
  Rejected on evidence: pi's compiled TypeBox validation needs Kind-bearing schemas
  (`CHANGELOG.md:819`, `CHANGELOG.md:902`), so the cast would hide a runtime break.
- One package carrying both `pi.extensions` and `bin` (round 1 Q2 option C).
  Rejected: one manifest cannot cleanly answer two hosts' packaging conventions.

## Detour: ask_user_question copy

The user noted the `ask_user_question` tool read as one question per call.
Fixed as a copy-only change (`f863b7805`): the parameter and tool descriptions now state that one call carries
one free-form string holding any number of questions, and the user answers them together in one multiline answer.
No schema or implementation change.

## Next action

Complete.
Nothing remains open from the confirmed plan.

## Implementation

Shaped exactly as the interview recorded,
with these commits:

- `feat(agent-harness-shared-truncate)`: pi-parity truncation port with differential tests.
- `feat(agent-harness-shared-search-fetch)`: pi-free core with shared tool specs,
  guarded valibot to TypeBox converter, shared executors, and the moved behavior suites.
- `refactor(pi-plugin-search-fetch)`: pi adapter over the shared core.
- `feat(mcp-stdio)`: `resources/list` and `resources/read` dispatch with a `ResourceProvider`.
- `feat(mcp-search-fetch)`: the MCP server bin exposing `web_search` and `web_fetch`.

Recorded defaults kept:
resource URI scheme `search-fetch://response/<id>` backed by the same temp file,
bounded in-memory index of 32 recent responses.

## Verification record

Unit suites (all green, zero lint findings on every package touched):

- `agent-harness-shared-truncate`: behavior plus pi parity corpus.
- `agent-harness-shared-search-fetch`: 26 cases across moved suites plus converter,
  queue, and shared execution.
- `mcp-stdio`: 20 cases including the resource surface.
- `mcp-search-fetch`: 6 protocol cases including the truncated-resource round trip.

Guard proof (GFP):
the parity suite was shown to fail against `piTruncateHead` after sabotaging the port's
separator accounting, then the port was restored and re-proved green.

Scripted MCP client against the built bin
(`/var/home/user/temp/agent/mcp-probe/out.txt`, `out2.txt`):

- `server/discover` advertises `tools` and `resources` capabilities and the instructions.
- `tools/list` shows `web_search` and `web_fetch` with the shared descriptions and schemas.
- Real `tools/call web_search` returned Exa results as JSONL.
- Real `tools/call web_fetch` showed live Linkup to Exa fallback on stderr and returned the Exa response.
- A 425.3KB real response truncated to its head plus temp path,
  then added the resource URI line and `resource_link` block;
  `resources/list` showed the record and `resources/read` returned all 435,496 characters.
- `resources/read` for an unknown URI answers `-32602` naming the URI.

Live OpenCodeReview verification (the one real host from Q9):

- `ocr config set mcp_servers.search-fetch.{command,args,tools}` written to
  `~/.opencodereview/config.json`.
- One real `ocr review` on a throwaway repository diff, provider `hyper/glm-5.3-flash`.
- The review agent called `web_search` five times and `web_fetch` five times through this server,
  19 tool calls total with zero failures.

## Deviations and notes

- Both new packages ship `private: true` so nothing enters the publish pipeline unasked;
  the category siblings are publishable, and publishing stays an open offer.
- `mcp-stdio/src/tool-schema.ts` carried a misplaced lint suppression;
  relocated to the documented disable/enable form so the package lint reaches zero.
- `package/pi-plugin/search-fetch` keeps 9 pre-existing type errors
  (`tools.unit.test.ts` ctx fixtures, `mise.verify-extension.ts` fake ExtensionAPI),
  verified identical on pristine HEAD and left to the migration owner.
- The blocklist error text keeps its `pi-search-fetch` wording on both surfaces for parity.
- Multi-package commits crash the `mono/dependent-version-bump` policy plugin;
  worked around with per-package commits, recorded in
  `doc/troubleshooting/cli-git-dependent-version-bump-decoder.md`.
