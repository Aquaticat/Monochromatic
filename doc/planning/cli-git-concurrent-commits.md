# cli-git concurrent commits

Grilling session started 2026-09-25.
Status: design in progress; nothing implemented.

## Goal

Several `git commit` invocations against the same worktree and branch run at the same time,
and all of them land as separate sequential commits.
Native Git rejects the later ones with `index.lock` `EEXIST`;
issue #560 is a real collision.

## Evidence

- `package/git-policy/cli/src/policy-engine/commit-transaction-workspace.ts` opens `<index>.lock` with `wx`,
  so a second transaction fails immediately instead of waiting.
- The lock is held across every policy pass,
  the real `git commit` including its hooks,
  and post-commit index installation (`package/git-policy/cli/SPEC.md`, "Transaction protocol").
- Explicit-path commits already build the commit tree in a private index from `HEAD` plus selected paths.
- Policies may read `trackedFiles` for any pathspec and `headOid`,
  and candidate `change`/`revision` are relative to `HEAD`
  (`SPEC.md`, "Public authoring declarations"),
  so a verdict can depend on `HEAD` beyond the candidate bytes.
- Local real Git 2.55.0 has `git hook run` and `git merge-tree --write-tree --merge-base`.
- `git help git`, `GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS`: `git status` takes `index.lock` to refresh the index,
  so non-cli-git lock holders are routine.
- Wrapper-added commit latency in the fixture benchmark is roughly 0.3 to 0.45 seconds
  (`package/git-policy/cli/perf/lifecycle-latency-2026-07-16.json`);
  real-repo lock hold time with this repo's plugins is unmeasured.

## Private HEAD prototype, 2026-09-25

Disposable fixture,
real Git 2.55.0 at `/usr/bin/git`,
global and system config disabled,
SSH commit signing configured.

- Native `git commit` with `GIT_INDEX_FILE` private and `--git-dir` pointing at a private per-worktree admin dir
  (registered `git worktree add --detach --no-checkout`,
  or hand-built `HEAD` plus `commondir` file or `GIT_COMMON_DIR`)
  and `--work-tree` at the real worktree
  ran pre-commit,
  prepare-commit-msg,
  commit-msg,
  post-commit,
  the editor,
  template and cleanup,
  and signing.
- Hooks ran with the real worktree top level as cwd,
  saw the private index and private `HEAD`,
  and read real worktree files.
- Shared `HEAD`,
  `refs/heads/main`,
  their reflogs,
  and real `.git/index` bytes stayed unchanged.
- Replay with `git merge-tree --write-tree --merge-base`,
  `git commit-tree`,
  and compare-and-swap `git update-ref <ref> <new> <old>` produced the right tree,
  parent,
  author,
  and committer.
  Non-overlapping hunks in one file merged;
  overlapping hunks exited 1 and still printed a tree ID,
  so callers must check the exit status.

Measured caveats:

- The real index is stale after the ref moves;
  an ordinary commit afterwards committed a revert.
  The landing-time real index update is mandatory.
- Hooks inherit `GIT_DIR` and relative `GIT_WORK_TREE=.`;
  a hook that changes into a subdirectory and runs Git sees the wrong top level.
  Ordinary commits export neither.
- `git commit-tree` ignores `commit.gpgsign`;
  replay must pass `-S` when signing is configured.
- `git update-ref` without `-m` writes an empty reflog message.
- A registered no-checkout worktree protects its private commit from `gc`,
  appears in `git worktree list`,
  and needs `git worktree remove --force`.
  An unregistered admin dir is invisible,
  but `git gc --prune=now` deleted its commits.

Untested:
concurrency,
the wrapper on `PATH`,
hook frameworks,
GPG signing,
user config,
`--amend` and `--verbose` with a private `HEAD`,
sparse checkout,
submodules,
`core.hooksPath`,
`extensions.worktreeConfig`.

## Hook environment probe, 2026-09-25

Disposable fixture,
real Git 2.55.0.
Driver scripts and raw reports lived in the session scratchpad;
the durable write-ups are the `doc/troubleshooting/` docs for these Git hook quirks.

- No plain invocation gives hooks an absolute `GIT_WORK_TREE`:
  Git rewrites `--work-tree` and `GIT_WORK_TREE` to `.` for hooks.
- `core.worktree` from `-c`,
  `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT`,
  or the admin dir's `config` is ignored,
  and `-c extensions.worktreeConfig=true` is not honoured.
  Only `extensions.worktreeConfig` in the real common config plus `<admin>/config.worktree` works,
  which is a persistent repository config write.
- `hook.<event>.enabled=false` suppresses config-based hooks but not the hookdir hook,
  contradicting `git help config`.
- `-c core.hooksPath=<dir>` does not disable config-based hooks.
- A dispatcher shim works for hookdir and config-based hooks:
  `-c core.hooksPath=<shim>` plus `-c hook.<event>.enabled=false` for each event,
  where each shim event exports `GIT_WORK_TREE="$(pwd)"` and runs
  `git -c hook.<event>.enabled=true -c core.hooksPath=<original> hook run --ignore-missing <event> -- "$@"`.
  Hooks saw an absolute work tree and correct subdirectory views,
  failures propagated,
  and `post-commit` did not run.
  Every `-c` leaks to hook children through `GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS`.
- After landing,
  `git hook run post-commit` in the real worktree runs hookdir and config hooks with no private variables,
  but without the native `GIT_INDEX_FILE`,
  `GIT_AUTHOR_*`,
  and `GIT_EDITOR=:`.
- A `git stash push --keep-index` and `git stash pop` inside a private pre-commit hook
  left real index bytes unchanged
  but transiently reverted the shared worktree's unstaged edit
  and pushed a transient entry onto the shared `refs/stash`.

## Foreign `index.lock` research, 2026-09-25

Git source at commit `0f8e75abebff` plus experiments with real Git 2.55.0.

- Git's only index lock is the `O_EXCL` file;
  there is no advisory lock,
  and the fd is `O_CLOEXEC`.
- Native `git commit -a`,
  `-i`,
  `-o`,
  interactive,
  and partial commits close the lock fd but keep `index.lock` on disk through
  pre-commit,
  prepare-commit-msg,
  the editor,
  and commit-msg
  (`builtin/commit.c`, lines 402 to 550 and 1957).
  Measured:
  a 3 second hook meant 3 seconds of lock with no holder.
  So no open holder does not mean abandoned.
- Plain `git commit` of staged changes releases the lock before hooks run.
- `git status` held the lock for a median of about 3.2 ms in a 10,000-file fixture.
- `core.lockfilePid=true`
  (default false,
  present in 2.55.0)
  writes `index~pid.lock` with the owner PID;
  Git's own `EEXIST` message uses `kill(pid, 0)` to call a lock stale,
  and Git never deletes it.
- Git has no index lock timeout;
  its other lock timeouts
  (`core.packedRefsTimeout`,
  `core.configLockTimeout`,
  1000 ms defaults)
  retry with quadratic backoff and jitter.
- After `kill -9`,
  the lock and PID file remained,
  and an orphaned hook still pointed `GIT_INDEX_FILE` at the lock.
- Holder scans must compare device and inode,
  not paths;
  `/proc` visibility stops at other users,
  `hidepid`,
  PID namespaces,
  and network filesystems.
  macOS denial is silent.
  On Windows,
  a `DELETE` probe could delay Git's own rename.
- `git help stash`:
  `pop` without an argument takes `stash@{0}`,
  the latest entry of shared `refs/stash`,
  so hook A's pop after hook B's push restores B's stash.

## Decisions

- Meaning: concurrent separate invocations,
  not one invocation producing several commits.
- Scope: default on in every repository the wrapper runs in.
- Mechanism: parallel preparation,
  serial landing.
  The owner chose this over a lock queue because the engineering capacity exists now.
- Replay: three-way content merge from the preparation base onto the new `HEAD`.
- Replay conflict: fail,
  nothing lands,
  and the diagnostic names conflicting paths and the winning commit;
  never re-prepare from current worktree bytes.
- Policy re-run after replay: record each policy's lazy reads
  (candidate bytes,
  `trackedFiles` pathspecs,
  `headOid`)
  and re-run only policies whose read set changed.
  Policies that read outside the API declare it and always re-run.
- Hooks and editor: run during preparation.
  The editor,
  `prepare-commit-msg`,
  and `commit-msg` run once;
  `pre-commit` re-runs outside the landing lock against the replayed index whenever the replayed tree differs,
  then landing retries.
- Landing order: preparation completion order.
- Starvation guard: after K lost landing races a commit reserves the next landing slot;
  others keep preparing and revalidating but cannot land until it lands or fails.
  K defaults to 2,
  is tunable,
  and the concurrent-commit benchmark confirms the default.
- Waiting: unbounded while the cli-git landing owner is alive;
  bounded for an `index.lock` without a known owner.
- `--amend` and merge,
  cherry-pick,
  revert conclusions fail when `HEAD` moved.
- Index commits participate with the index captured at invocation.
- Auto-push: single-flight per branch.
  A landed commit joins an in-flight push covering its OID or pushes the branch tip itself,
  and exits only once the remote contains its OID.

## Recommendation calibration

Owner, 2026-09-25:
engineering budget is not a constraint;
recommend the most correct and performant option,
never the cheapest to build.
This applies to this design session only;
the owner declined an `AGENTS.md` rule.

## Settled by the decisions, veto open

- Same worktree and branch only;
  Git refuses one branch checked out in two worktrees.
- Each commit captures selected bytes at invocation,
  inherent in parallel preparation.
- The post-commit real index is computed at landing against the then-current real index,
  never against the invocation-time copy,
  or a landing would erase another commit's staging.
- Transaction journals become per transaction,
  so several prepared transactions coexist;
  recovery handles each.
- Replay onto a moved `HEAD` uses `git merge-tree --write-tree --merge-base`;
  cli-git declares a minimum Git version covering the plumbing it uses.
- Preparation runs native `git commit` against a private index and a private admin dir `HEAD`,
  per the prototype.
- When `HEAD` did not move,
  landing advances the ref to the prepared commit itself,
  keeping its signature.
- Replay signs with `git commit-tree -S` whenever the prepared commit was signed.
- The landing critical section holds the landing lock and real `index.lock`,
  advances the ref by compare-and-swap with a `-m` reflog message carrying the recovery nonce,
  installs the real index,
  then releases,
  so no ordinary commit can observe a moved ref with a stale index.
- Pending prepared commits are protected from `gc` by a private ref under `refs/cli-git/`,
  deleted at landing,
  abort,
  or recovery;
  the private admin dir stays unregistered,
  so `git worktree list` never shows it.
  The ref is briefly visible to `git for-each-ref` and `git log --all`.
- Hooks during preparation run through the dispatcher shim.
  It resolves the repository's own `core.hooksPath`,
  respects user-disabled events,
  omits `post-commit`,
  exports an absolute `GIT_WORK_TREE`,
  and restores the caller's original `GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS` before dispatch.
  Shim executables follow the repository's no-shell-script rule.
  `extensions.worktreeConfig` is rejected:
  it mutates every repository's config and still needs the shim for `post-commit`.
- `post-commit` runs once after landing through `git hook run post-commit` in the real worktree,
  with native-equivalent `GIT_INDEX_FILE`,
  `GIT_AUTHOR_*`,
  and `GIT_EDITOR=:`.
- A replay conflict is a `core-finding` JSONL event with exit `1`,
  matching other expected commit rejections.
- New JSONL events report replays and lost landing races.
- Required disposable fixtures and lifecycle benchmarks gain concurrent-commit scenarios.

## Rejected

- Lock queue with the unchanged transaction:
  owner prefers parallel preparation now.
- Batch syntax producing several commits from one invocation.

## Open questions

- Foreign `index.lock` owner classification and wait bound.
- Hook concurrency:
  hooks that mutate shared worktree or `refs/stash` can collide when preparations overlap.

## Next action

Collect answers to the open questions;
no implementation until the owner confirms shared understanding.
