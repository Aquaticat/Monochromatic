# Issue 563: exact array-conversion lint policy

Status:
 implemented;
 issues 563,
 564,
 and 565 closed by commits on `main`.
Issue: <https://github.com/Aquaticat/Monochromatic/issues/563>.

## Problem

`unicorn/no-useless-spread` (oxlint 1.85.0,
 error via `correctness`) removes the spread in `[...x.m()]`
whenever `m` is a method name that returns a fresh array on `Array.prototype`.
It has no type information,
 so it also rewrites strings,
 typed arrays,
 and iterators.
`--fix` applies it because the rule emits a `SafeFix` despite its `fix_dangerous` metadata.

## Evidence gathered

### Reproductions on oxlint 1.85.0

- `[...text.slice(0, 3,),].some(...)` becomes `text.slice(0, 3,).some(...)`:
   TS2339.
- `Array.from(typed.map(double,),)` becomes `[...typed.map(double,),]` via `unicorn/prefer-spread`,
  then `typed.map(double,)` via `no-useless-spread`:
   `Uint8Array` instead of `number[]`,
   silent when inferred.
- `unicorn/prefer-spread` alone rewrites `scoopGrams.slice()` to `[...scoopGrams]` (typed array becomes
  `number[]`) and `menuCode.slice()` to `[...menuCode]` (caught afterwards by `no-misused-spread`).
- Autofixed diagnostics never print under the wrapper's fix loop (`oxlint-wrapper.ts:254-277`),
  so `oxlint-guidance.ts` entries cannot warn about an applied fix.

### Upstream

- oxc issue 26159 tracks the `no-useless-spread` string case;
   PRs 26160 and 26615 are open and unreviewed.
- eslint-plugin-unicorn removed the unsafe fix in PR 1996 (2022) and now reports unknown receivers without a fix.
- oxlint cannot disable one rule's CLI autofix,
   and neither `no-useless-spread` nor `prefer-spread` has options.
- oxlint JS plugins receive no type information (oxc issue 19962);
   tsgolint has no custom-rule mechanism.
- unicorn `prefer-iterator-to-array` is the closest precedent for explicit conversions (`.toArray()`).

### Prototype

Branch `prototype/issue-563-explicit-conversions`,
 worktree `~/temp/agent/issue-563-conversions`,
directory `package/oxlint-plugin/no-restricted-syntax/prototype-issue-563/`.
The branch is committed and pushed after building the forbidden-strings scanner in the worktree;
 issue 563 carries a pointer comment.

- Narrow-typed helpers (`copyArray`,
   `numbersOf`,
   `collect`,
   `codePointsOf`) make TypeScript 7.0.2 reject
  every wrong receiver pairing tried (8 `@ts-expect-error` controls;
   a TS2578 positive control proves the probe).
- Because `copyArray` only accepts arrays,
   a syntax-only rule can report `copyArray(x.m())` as a useless copy
  with no false positive in code that type-checks.
  It must not autofix:
   on code that fails type-checking the unwrap would recreate the silent break.
- Learning cost of the helper vocabulary:
   four names,
   met only when the narrow ban fires (1 current hit),
  listed in the lint message;
   a wrong pick fails type-checking.
  `copyArray`,
   `numbersOf`,
   and `codePointsOf` errors read plainly (`'string' is not assignable to 'readonly unknown[]'`).
  `collect` with a `length?: never` guard produced `'number' is not assignable to 'undefined'`;
  a string-literal guard type puts the remedy into the TypeScript error text instead.
- Repo-wide run of the prototype rule over `package/`:
  1 spread of an ambiguous method result (a deliberate test fixture),
  175 spreads of other calls,
   465 spreads of values,
   15 `Array.from` calls;
  280 of the 656 hits sit in tests,
   fixtures,
   or fuzz packages.

### Built-ins replace the helpers

`builtins.prototype.ts` shows built-in spellings already let TypeScript reject every wrong receiver tried
(6 `@ts-expect-error` controls):
`iterator.toArray()` exists only on iterators;
`.values().toArray()` covers sets,
 maps,
 arrays,
 and typed arrays but not strings;
`array.toSpliced(0,)` copies arrays only.
What built-ins cannot do without types:
 tell a needless `x.map(f,).values().toArray()` on an array
from a needed one on a typed array.
The user noted progressive enhancement applies:
 a type-free baseline,
 with type information
narrowing messages and enabling safe fixes where the bridge can answer.

## Candidate policies

- Narrow ban with built-in vocabulary:
   ban `[...x.m()]` for ambiguous `m`;
   authors use `.toArray()`,
  `.values().toArray()`,
   string APIs.
- Narrow ban with typed helper vocabulary:
   the same ban plus helpers and a report-only useless-copy check.
- Broad ban:
   every sole spread and `Array.from` conversion;
   656 current hits.
- Type-aware rule over the TypeScript 7 bridge in `prefer-readonly-parameter-type`.

## Settled so far

- Scope excludes the string-only `prefer-spread` to `no-misused-spread` chain (user answer,
   Q2).
- Upstream fixes are not awaited;
   repo precedent replaces problematic upstream rules with project rules
  (`package/config/oxlint/src/rule/restriction.ts:115-140`).

### `prefer-spread` is not needed off for the baseline (correction)

An earlier recommendation to turn `unicorn/prefer-spread` off was retracted.
Its `Array.from(x.m(),)` rewrite lands in the banned shape,
 but the baseline only reports,
so the author sees an error instead of a silent break and the fix loop has no second fix to oscillate with.
Its `concat` arm only reports;
 its no-argument `toSpliced()` arm cannot type-check anyway.
Its `slice()` arm is a separate standalone defect:
 `scoopGrams.slice()` becomes `[...scoopGrams]`,
a `[...value]` spread the baseline does not ban.
Repo uses of single-argument `Array.from` are 2 deliberate string code-point splits,
 each suppressing `prefer-spread`
(`package/git-policy/cli/src/parser/commit-normalise.ts:122`,
 `package/module/i18n-compose/src/render-helpers.ts:147`).

## Decisions (2026-09-25)

- Baseline:
   `no-restricted-syntax/no-useless-spread` at `error` replaces `unicorn/no-useless-spread`.
  Non-method checks keep safe autofixes;
   `[...x.m(),]` for ambiguous method names (including `split`) reports
  without a fix and names the built-in spellings (Q6).
- Type-aware enhancement ships in this session under its own issue:
  where TypeScript resolves the file,
   the rule names the receiver kind and autofixes proven arrays (Q8).
- `unicorn/prefer-spread` is replaced,
   not turned off,
   under its own issue,
   in this session (Q7):
  `Array.from(x,)` to `[...x]` keeps its fix (equivalent for every iterable);
  `x.slice()` fixes only when types prove an array.
  Without types it still reports,
   without a fix (user correction:
   code without types holds itself to a higher
  standard to compensate),
   naming the unambiguous spellings:
   `[...x]` for arrays,
  `new Uint8Array(x,)` style constructors for typed arrays,
   plain `x` for immutable strings.
  With types,
   a proven typed-array or string receiver is not reported.
- No upstream contact;
   oxc issue 26159 is cited.

## Implementation findings

- Rules:
  `package/oxlint-plugin/no-restricted-syntax/src/rule/no-useless-spread/`,
  `package/oxlint-plugin/no-restricted-syntax/src/rule/prefer-spread/`,
  shared evidence in `package/oxlint-plugin/no-restricted-syntax/src/rule/spread-evidence/`.
  Tests:
  `package/oxlint-plugin/no-restricted-syntax/src/spread-rules.unit.test.ts`;
  removing either typed-array or ambiguity guard fails the issue 563 or 565 tests
  (negative controls run before commit).
- The TypeScript 7 bridge is imported from the readonly plugin's `/ts` subpath;
  the bundled `@monochromatic-dev/config-oxlint` output places it in one shared chunk,
  so both plugins use one TypeScript process.
- `sourceCode.isGlobalReference` drops `Array` and `Object` under the shared config's explicit `env`;
  both rules resolve globals by the absence of a file-local declaration instead
  (`doc/troubleshooting/oxlint-js-plugin-global-reference-env.md`).
- A repo-wide run found `Buffer.concat(chunks,)` reported as an ambiguous array `concat` in an untyped file;
  undeclared receivers are now treated as host namespaces.
- Enabling both rules repo-wide adds no diagnostics outside ignored test fixtures,
  except two `prefer-spread` warnings in untyped bench analysis scripts
  that already carry 270 lint problems and are not lint-clean targets.
- The two `unicorn/prefer-spread` suppressions around `Array.from(string,)` were removed;
  the project rule leaves `Array.from` of strings alone.
- Known limitation shared with upstream:
  `[...arr]` and `arr.slice()` differ on sparse arrays (spread fills holes with `undefined`);
  types cannot prove density,
  so fixes on proven arrays assume dense arrays.

## Open questions

- Whether to post the three upstream drafts:
  the oxc issue 26159 comment and the `prefer-spread` issue in `doc/troubleshooting/oxlint-spread-autofix.md`,
  and the `isGlobalReference` issue in `doc/troubleshooting/oxlint-js-plugin-global-reference-env.md`.
