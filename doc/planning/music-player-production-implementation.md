# Music player: production implementation of the accepted design

## Purpose and authority

On 2026-10-10 the human said: "Now go prod. Dev work. Use Haiku subagents."
That authorizes production implementation of the accepted design in `package/music-player/design/decisions.md`.
Earlier records that said no production implementation was authorized (for example D101 to D104) described the design rounds;
this instruction supersedes them for implementation, and not for any design question still open.
Production source had been reverted to design-only on 2026-09-09 (`6d2d06e41`: "The accepted visual review did not authorize production app implementation"),
so the production app is the older player and differs from the design in many places.

The work happens on the branch `feat/music-player-production`, in the worktree `~/temp/agent/music-player-production`.
Nothing is merged to `main` without a verified work package.

## Method

- Model choice: Haiku 5.5 by default.
  The human gave the authority (2026-10-10) to elevate to Sonnet 5.5 whenever its results show Haiku is not good enough;
  the orchestrator decides that from the results, and records each elevation and its reason here.
- Haiku subagents write code and tests for one bounded work package each, in the shared worktree, in disjoint files.
  They never run Gradle, never commit and never touch another package's files.
- The orchestrator (this session) builds and runs the unit tests in a capped container, reviews every diff,
  fixes or re-delegates, and commits each verified package with explicit pathspecs.
- Reference implementations come first: where the design folder holds a tested JavaScript reference
  (`template-reference.mjs`, the keyboard classifier), the Kotlin port mirrors its cases one to one.
- Where only a Compose study exists, the study's source on `prototype/music-player-first-run-access`
  (worktree `~/temp/agent/music-player-first-run-access`, `app/src/debug`) is the visual reference
  and the decision text is the requirement.
- Kotlin in this package carries a What, Why and "In TS you'd write" comment block above every declaration,
  as in `core/PlaybackMode.kt`; subagents copy that shape exactly.

## Work packages

Each is independently verifiable.
Packages 1 and 2 are pure logic with an existing reference; the rest need the screen they belong to.

1. Track template engine (D89 to D99): port `design/template-reference.mjs` to `core/TrackTemplate.kt`
   with a test file that mirrors its 94 cases.
2. Keyboard map classifier (D102): port the classifier inside `design/questions/keyboard-map.prototype.html`
   to `core/KeyboardMap.kt` with a test that mirrors `design/keyboard-map-test.mjs`.
3. Player screen to the design: remove the in-app volume row (D43), fold and cover layouts (D41 to D45),
   deck content height (D44).
4. Folder picker: letter rail (D17, D28), folder names (D31), the cover picker with an upward caret while open (D46, D104).
5. Search page (D47 to D74).
6. Feedback overlays and Undo (D83, D29).
7. Scan indicator (D26, D84).
8. First-run states (D95, D100, D101); needs a source-status outcome the production list API does not give yet.
9. Settings page, empty (D87), and the template editor (D89 to D99), on top of package 1.
10. Track context menu.
11. Keyboard wiring on top of package 2.
12. Desktop app inheriting the Fold visual choices.

## Queue

- [ ] Package 1.
- [ ] Package 2.
- [ ] Packages 3 to 12, each started only when the previous one it builds on is committed.
