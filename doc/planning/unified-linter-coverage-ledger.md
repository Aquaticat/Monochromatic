# Unified linter coverage ledger

Every responsibility the incumbent Rust linter and Markdown linter carry,
who consumes it,
and its owner in the unified linter (`AGENTS.md` RCO).
Design interview state:
[`doc/handover/unified-linter.md`](../handover/unified-linter.md).

Source:
a read-only survey on 2026-09-23 with file and line citations,
spot-checked by the parent session
(`md040-fenced-code-language.ts:154` inserts `text`;
no `rust-linter.toml` exists outside ignored trees;
the root `lint` aggregate in `mise.toml` does not list `lint:rust`;
`context.rs:141-153` keeps `parse.syntax_node()` and no crate reads `parse.errors()`).
Paths are repository-relative;
line numbers are as of commit `8d73b1bab`.

Owner states:
"decided" names the round that settled it,
"open" means a pending question in the handover.

## Rust linter

Packages:
`package/linter/rust` (CLI and language server),
`package/rust-module/rust-linter-core`,
`package/rust-module/rust-linter-pattern`,
`package/rust-linter-plugin/builtin`.

### Rules

- `builtin/max-lines`:
   code lines per file counted with the real lexer,
   blank and comment-only lines excluded,
   reported where the budget is crossed
   (`max_lines.rs:133-219`).
  Category `pedantic`,
   non-suppressible (`max_lines.rs:110-112`),
   not fixable.
  Option `max`,
   default 300 (`default.toml:21`),
   precedence `--max`,
   then configured `max`,
   then 300 (`lib.rs:573-594`).
  Owner:
   Rust rules plugin,
   exact behavior (decided,
   round 1 parity).
- `builtin/require-rustdoc`:
   doc comment on fn,
   struct,
   enum,
   union,
   trait,
   type alias,
   const,
   static,
   module,
   extern crate,
   use,
   impl block,
   enum variant,
   record and tuple fields,
   and the file itself through `//!`
   (`require_rustdoc.rs:103-120`).
  Detection through `ra_ap_syntax` `DocCommentIter` (`289-306`).
  Hardcoded cxx-qt carve-out:
   files mentioning `cxx_qt` or `cxx_qt_lib` skip `use` items and trait-impl members
   (`164-182`,
   `202-217`,
   `265-267`).
  Macros are not covered.
  Non-suppressible (`501-512`),
   not fixable.
  Owner:
   Rust rules plugin,
   exact behavior (decided).
- Declarative `[[pattern]]` rules:
   keys `id`,
   `match`,
   `message`,
   `fix`,
   `help`,
   `severity` (default `error`;
   `config/file.rs:103-141`).
  Category `restriction`,
   suppressible,
   fix registered at Suggestion trust (`pattern_rule.rs:167-181`),
   dropped when the template names an unbound metavariable.
  An unparseable `match` exits 2.
  Matcher:
   `META_` metavariables,
   fragment parsed as item,
   then expression,
   then statement in a fn body (`fragment.rs:82`),
   structural and whitespace-insensitive,
   strings and comments skipped,
   repeated metavariables must bind identical text.
  Owner:
   Rust language plugin,
   Rust-only (decided,
   round 2),
   expressed in HCL (decided,
   round 2).
- `builtin/invalid-disable-directive`,
   always `error`:
   a directive without justification,
   or aimed at a non-suppressible rule
   (`directive/apply.rs:19`,
   `164-195`).
  Owner:
   core,
   both languages (open:
   directive spelling).
- `builtin/unused-disable-directive`,
   opt-in (`apply.rs:16`,
   `105-117`,
   `197-211`).
  Owner:
   core,
   ESLint-shaped `reportUnusedDisableDirectives` (open:
   spelling).

### Command line

Flags (`cli.rs`):
`--max`,
`-c`/`--config`,
`--disable-nested-config`,
`-A`/`-W`/`-D` applied left to right,
`--lsp`,
`--print-config`,
`--rules`,
`--init`,
`--threads`,
`--ignore-path`,
`--ignore-pattern`,
`--no-ignore`,
`--no-error-on-unmatched-pattern`,
`--debug`,
`--fix`,
`--fix-suggestions`,
`--fix-dangerously`,
`--report-unused-disable-directives`,
`--report-unused-disable-directives-severity`,
`--quiet`,
`--silent`,
`--deny-warnings`,
`--max-warnings`,
positional paths defaulting to `.`.
`--debug=timings` is advertised but not implemented (`lib.rs:269`).
Owner:
ESLint-shaped flags,
every capability kept (decided,
round 2);
the mapping is open.

### Configuration

- `rust-linter.toml`,
   discovered from the process working directory up to the root,
   merged outermost first,
   on top of a compiled-in `default.toml`
   (`load.rs:25`,
   `198-264`;
   `config.rs:29`,
   `68-72`).
- `extends` with cycle detection;
   keys `include-patterns`,
   `ignore-patterns`,
   `options`,
   `categories`,
   `rules`,
   `overrides`,
   `pattern`,
   `plugins`,
   `settings`,
   all `deny_unknown_fields`.
- Severities `off`,
   `warn`,
   `error`,
   with `allow` and `deny` aliases;
   seven oxlint categories,
   only `correctness` on by default.
- Resolution order:
   category default,
   `[categories]`,
   pattern severity,
   `[rules]`,
   overrides in order,
   the winning layer's include and exclude,
   then `-A`/`-W`/`-D`
   (`resolve.rs:235-313`).
- Unused surfaces:
   `settings` has no reader,
   and rules receive only `max_lines`,
   so no other rule option reaches a rule.
- Measured use:
   no `rust-linter.toml` exists;
   every consumer runs on built-in defaults.
- Owner:
   HCL in meow's block form (decided,
   round 2);
   lookup semantics open.

### Default exemptions

Both rules are off for `**/tests/**`,
`**/*_tests.rs`,
`**/fuzz/**`,
`build.rs`,
`**/fixture/**`,
`**/test-fixture/**`,
and `**/invalid/**` (`default.toml:28-78`).
The last three go beyond `AGENTS.md` MXR and RDC.
The walker is gitignore-aware and picks only `.rs` files;
an explicitly named file bypasses the walk.
Owner:
compiled-in default configuration (decided,
parity).

### Suppression directives

- `rust-linter-disable`,
   `-enable`,
   `-disable-line`,
   `-disable-next-line` in any comment token,
   including doc and block comments;
   text inside strings is ignored.
- Rules named by `id` or `plugin/id`;
   none named means all.
- Justification after `--` is mandatory;
   without it the directive suppresses nothing and is reported.
- Non-suppressible rules refuse the directive and keep the finding.
- A `disable` lasts until the next `enable` or end of file.
- Measured use:
   no directives outside the linter's own crates.
- Owner:
   core,
   for both languages;
   spelling open (depends on the name).

### Autofix

- Fix kinds Safe,
   Suggestion,
   Dangerous,
   gated by `--fix`,
   `--fix-suggestions`,
   `--fix-dangerously`.
- Up to 10 fix passes per file,
   then a reporting pass;
   edits sorted,
   overlaps skipped.
- Defect:
   the applier flattens edits across fixes (`fix/apply.rs:41-46`),
   so a multi-edit fix can land partly,
   against the "A Fix is atomic" claim in the core README.
  Only single-edit fixes exist today.
- Owner:
   core;
   the trust model under ESLint's fix and suggestion split is open.

### Output and exit codes

- JSONL only,
   one oxlint-shaped record per finding;
   a clean run prints nothing.
- `--quiet` hides warnings that still count;
   `--silent` prints nothing.
- Exit 0 clean,
   1 failing findings,
   2 setup error.
- Owner:
   ESLint-shaped formatters,
   JSONL kept as a capability (decided,
   round 2);
   the default is open.

### Parallelism

`--threads`,
defaulting to available parallelism;
the directory walk itself is sequential,
although the parity plan called for a parallel walk.
Owner:
core.

### Language server

- Hand-rolled JSON-RPC over stdio;
   `initialize`,
   `shutdown`,
   `exit`,
   `didOpen`,
   `didChange`,
   `didClose`;
   full document sync;
   diagnostics only.
- Defects:
   `lint_text` applies neither ignore patterns nor directives,
   so the editor can disagree with the CLI;
   URIs lose percent-decoding.
- Measured use:
   no editor configuration registers it.
- Owner:
   one server for both languages;
   framework open
   (`doc/audit/tech-meow-language-server-framework-vet-2026-09-17.md` recommends `lsp-server` 0.10.0 with `gen-lsp-types` 0.11.0).

### Introspection and library surface

- `--print-config`,
   `--rules`,
   `--init`.
- `run_cli` and `run_cli_from_env`;
   the latter drops ordered `-A`/`-W`/`-D` overrides and has no callers.
- No other `Cargo.toml` depends on these crates.
- `ra_ap_syntax` pinned `=0.0.335` in the CLI and core.
- Owner:
   ESLint-shaped `--print-config` and `--init`;
   `--rules` kept as a capability.

## Markdown linter

Package:
`package/cli/markdown-lint`.

### Engine

- Sätteri `markdownToMdast` and `mdxToMdast` with GFM and frontmatter (`parse.ts:1-22`,
   `58-85`);
   catalog pin `satteri >=0.10.5`.
- Code-point offsets converted to UTF-16 when astral characters appear.
- MDX nodes and their subtrees skipped by the shared walker (`walk.ts:14`,
   `96`).
- Owner:
   Markdown language plugin;
   parser crate open (research running).

### Rules

No rule takes options;
former markdownlint settings are hardcoded.

- `MD001` heading-increment:
   report-only.
- `MD014` commands-show-output:
   fixable,
   strips `$ ` prompts.
- `MD024` no-duplicate-heading:
   `siblings_only`,
   report-only.
- `MD025` single-h1:
   report-only.
- `MD026` no-trailing-punctuation:
   `.` and `:`,
   fixable.
- `MD034` no-bare-urls:
   `http`,
   `https`,
   `ftp`,
   and email;
   fixable by wrapping in angle brackets.
- `MD036` no-emphasis-as-heading:
   report-only.
- `MD040` fenced-code-language:
   fixable by inserting `text` (`md040-fenced-code-language.ts:154`);
   the package README wrongly calls it report-only.
- `MD053` reference-definitions:
   fixable,
   removes unused and duplicate definitions.
- `MD054` link-image-style:
   shortcut style only,
   fixable to collapsed style.
- `no-pipe-tables`:
   fixable to an HTML `<table>`.
- `semantic-line-breaks`:
   add-only fix after `,` `.` `;` `:` `?` `!`
   followed by whitespace or end of prose,
   with abbreviation,
   ellipsis,
   closing-delimiter,
   and bold-span guards.
- `lfs-image-url`:
   fixable rewrite to `<objectBase>/<oid>/<path>`,
   reading `.lfsconfig`,
   root `.gitattributes`,
   and the file oid;
   inert without `.lfsconfig` or for `--lfs-image-exclude` paths.
- Synthetic `markdown-lint-error`:
   a per-file processing failure becomes a finding.
- Synthetic `markdown-lint-safety`:
   refuses a fix that would empty a non-empty file.
- Owner:
   Markdown rules plugin,
   exact behavior (decided,
   round 1);
   synthetic findings move to core (open:
   whether they cover Rust too).

### Command line

`--fix`,
`--format=pretty|json` with `--json` winning,
repeatable `--lfs-image-exclude=` and `--rule=`,
`--stdin-path=` (one path,
no positional paths,
`.md` or `.mdx`),
`--help`.
Unknown flags are usage errors.
Owner:
ESLint-shaped flags (decided,
round 2);
`--lfs-image-exclude` becomes rule configuration or a flag (open).

### Configuration and discovery

- No configuration file and no severities:
   every finding fails the run.
- Walker:
   `.md` and `.mdx` only,
   nested `.gitignore` layers through the npm `ignore` package,
   built-in ignores `.git`,
   `node_modules`,
   `package-paused`,
   `package-deprecated`,
   `.out-of-scope`,
   explicit files bypass the walk,
   overlapping roots deduplicated,
   files over 5 MiB skipped silently.
- Owner:
   one walker in core;
   the built-in ignores become default configuration (decided,
   parity).

### Suppression

None;
the repository's Markdown holds no leftover `markdownlint-disable` comments.
Owner:
core directives gain an HTML-comment form for Markdown (decided,
round 2 ESLint surfaces;
spelling open).

### Autofix

Half-open offset edits,
applied from the end,
overlaps dropped,
re-parsed each pass for up to 10 passes,
then linted once more;
atomic writes that keep the file mode.
Owner:
core.

### Output and exit codes

- `pretty`:
   `path:line:col  ruleId  message`;
   `json`:
   an array of `{path,line,column,ruleId,message,fixable}`.
- Report on stdout,
   the fixed-file count on stderr;
   in stdin mode with `--fix`,
   fixed source on stdout and the report on stderr.
- Exit 0 clean,
   1 violations remain,
   2 usage error.
- Library exports (`index.ts`) have no consumer outside the package's tests and the git policy's subprocess call.
- Owner:
   ESLint-shaped formatters and `--stdin` handling (decided,
   round 2);
   exact mapping open.

## Commit-time integration

Package:
`package/git-policy/markdown-lint`,
registered as `markdown/autofix` in `cli-git.config.ts:22-43`.

- Default severity `warn`,
   warn-safe;
   triggers pre-forward,
   post-commit,
   manual-push,
   direct-check,
   direct-fix.
- Options `command` (default `['node','package/cli/markdown-lint/src/cli.ts']`),
   `rules` (default `['lfs-image-url']`),
   `exclude` (also forwarded as `--lfs-image-exclude`).
- One candidate at a time through the stdin fix mode;
   exit 1 means violations,
   read from stderr;
   exit 2 or anything else raises `MarkdownLintPluginError`.
- Findings `markdown-autofix` with a full-content patch,
   or `markdown-violation`.
- Non-UTF-8 candidates skipped.
- Also exports `createFullContentPatch`,
   consumed by `package/git-policy/repository/src/dependent-version-bump-policy.ts:17`.
- Shipped into cli-git through file-enforcer mirrors (`file-enforcer.config.ts:2294-2310`,
   `2270-2273`).
- Owner:
   stays,
   pointed at the new binary (decided,
   round 2 cutover plan);
   how it finds the binary is open.

## Consumers

- Root `lint:rust` fans out to 17 package `lint:rust` tasks,
   each `cargo run --quiet --manifest-path <rel>/linter/rust/Cargo.toml -- .` in debug profile.
- `mise run lint` does not run the Rust linter:
   the aggregate's comment says step 1 reaches `lint:rust` through each package's `lint`,
   but those are `cargo check`,
   cargo dispatches,
   or Android Gradle Lint.
  The same claim appears in `doc/planning/monorepo-manager-from-scratch-design.md:1892`.
- Rust crates without `lint:rust`:
   `package/cli/forbidden-strings.fuzz`
   and `package/rust-module/forbidden-regex.fuzz`,
   whose path escapes the `**/fuzz/**` default.
- Root `lint:markdown` and `format:markdown` run `node package/cli/markdown-lint/src/cli.ts --lfs-image-exclude=package/ssg/`,
   inside the `lint` and `format` aggregates.
- `file-enforcer.config.ts`:
   `CARGO_PROFILE_LINTER` (`1570`,
   `1624`),
   Cargo manifest management,
   and the cli-git mirror.
- `package/config/pnpr/config.yaml:50`,
   `79`:
   private-registry publishing entries for the Markdown linter.
- `package/config/lfs-r2-worker/README.md:77-80`:
   the server contract `lfs-image-url` relies on.
- No CI workflow,
   editor configuration,
   or hook runs either linter,
   apart from cli-git.
- `AGENTS.md`:
   MXR names `monochromatic-rust-linter`;
   RDC names `require-rustdoc` and the cxx-qt carve-out;
   MXL,
   LN5,
   MD1,
   MD3,
   MD4,
   MD5,
   and MD6 map to rules.
- Owner:
   every consumer switches in one change (decided,
   round 2).

## Incidental defects

Recorded here for the port,
not fixed during the design interview.

- Package README says `MD040` is report-only;
   it fixes.
- `mise.toml:890-891` says `lint:markdown` runs under Bun;
   it runs under Node.
- `mise.toml:953-957` says dprint formats Markdown;
   the dprint Markdown plugin is disabled.
- `mise.toml:908-909` cites #235 as open;
   it closed on 2026-06-03.
- `rust-linter-core/Cargo.toml:44-46` mentions JSON,
   GitLab,
   and SARIF formats that were cut.
- `doc/troubleshooting/markdownlint-cli2.md` says the replacement runs under Bun.
- `package/linter/rust/README.md:7-23` says clippy cannot require docs on private items;
   `cargo clippy --explain missing_docs_in_private_items` documents such a lint.
