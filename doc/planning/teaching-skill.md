# Teaching skill discovery

## Status and request

The user requested a skill to curb failures in AI teaching and drafted teaching materials.
They requested grilling to discover the failures from their experience.
Repository material remains potentially relevant.
Discovery is ongoing. The revised prototype has been operationally verified and visibly presented for critique.
Its teaching effectiveness and the sufficiency of the proposed skill requirements remain unestablished.
The user has now rejected the opening preview as confusing and detached from a real-world example.
After the user explicitly said "Do it", the opening was rebuilt as the shop conversation.
The corrected opening has passed the current operational checks and was visibly presented in Helium.
That is not user acceptance, learner-performance evidence, or approval of the final skill.
The shared-understanding checkpoint was premature and is withdrawn.
[Proposed acceptance checks](teaching-skill-acceptance.md) are only a working hypothesis.
The user requires an updated Promise toy before continuing to weed out failure modes.
No skill design has been confirmed or implemented.

## Evidence from the user

Example learner request: "Teach me to make rotated chicken".

The user identified these failures in the AI response:

- "A little bit of salt": gives a novice no usable quantity.
  The user also noted that "rotated chicken" is not the dish name
  and that the wording signals missing cooking knowledge.
- "Get raw chicken from grocery store": leaves the procurement step unactionable.
  The user wanted a specific product link for delivery or a map opened for an in-person trip.
- "Set oven to 300degrees": omits the temperature scale and invites misunderstanding.

## Confirmed intake requirements

The user confirmed that the AI should ask clarifying questions.
Their examples specify meanings, not exact wording or a canned questionnaire:

- Discover relevant evidence in the user's workspace first.
  If there is sufficient reason to suspect an A/B or X/Y problem,
  ask about the underlying choice and whether a different approach would better serve the goal.
  Suspicion must come from discovery, not a reflex to challenge every request.
- Anchor questions in the user's experience and available tools.
  Ask about comfort with the relevant techniques or tools.
- Establish the intended outcome:
  accomplishing the immediate task and whether the user also wants missing background knowledge
  that improves their general ability.
  Offer requested science or related background in foldable `<details>` sections.
- Explain the intended presentation.
  Default to building an interactive, visual, self-contained, auto-dark-theme, printable HTML demo.
  Mention Markdown as an available alternative when the user wants something quick.
- Printing is never a reason to simplify either output:
  the HTML page as viewed in a browser or the printout.
  The user explicitly defined "source material" to include both.
  Their requirement is: "Print merely graceful degrades the interactivity."
  Both versions preserve the full teaching material, including depth, examples, and explanations.
  The browser version keeps the interactivity the lesson needs.
  Only the printout adapts interactive mechanisms into usable static equivalents.
  Printability requires another presentation of the material,
  not a least-interactive version imposed on both outputs.
  Keeping the browser version complete while reducing the printout does not satisfy this requirement.
  Required counterexample from the user:
  "oh you want it printable? I'll not add some interactivity, ANYWHERE".
  The skill must explicitly deter omitting browser interactivity just because print support was requested.

## Design tree

- Establish what the teaching should accomplish.
  - Settled: clarify the intended dish instead of passing over the ambiguous name.
  - Settled: discover workspace evidence before asking questions that evidence can answer.
  - Settled: investigate an alternative underlying goal when evidence warrants it.
  - Settled: anchor relevant experience and available tools through discovery and questions.
  - Settled: distinguish the immediate goal from additionally desired background learning.
- Make instructions usable by the intended learner.
  - Observed failure: quantities without usable calibration.
  - Observed failure: procurement instructions without concrete access to the required item.
  - Observed failure: measurements without units.
  - Captured: profile-based framing, prerequisite order, definitions, and role-appropriate mental models.
  - Captured: apples and scaling as an example of motivating an abstraction through a demonstrated need.
  - Captured: independent performance and explanation differ from inspecting supplied working code.
- Present the material.
  - Settled: default HTML properties and availability of Markdown alternative.
  - Settled: optional background can use foldable `<details>` sections.
  - Captured: concept-revealing interactions, state-linked code, syntax highlighting, and honest affordances.
  - Settled: preserve both browser interactivity and full teaching substance in the printout.
- Determine remaining scope and operating boundaries after the failures are understood.
  - Open: how these requirements apply to live teaching and drafted materials.
  - Open: acceptance examples and confirmation of shared understanding.

## Interview adjustment

The user answered "Of course ask clarifying questions" to the question about the first response.
Clarification was already implied by the initial failure example.
Subsequent questions should discover unresolved failures or preferences,
not ask the user to ratify an obvious repair.

## Concrete lesson requested

The user redirected the interview toward a built example:
"Build me a *.local.html explaining Promises in JavaScript."
They explicitly allowed clarifying questions.
Build this lesson now to anchor subsequent critique;
this authorizes the lesson artifact, not a finalized teaching skill.

Planned artifact: `doc/planning/promises-teaching.local.html`.
The repository ignores `*.local.*`; preserve that local-only status.
The confirmed default presentation requirements apply.

Workspace discovery found relevant examples:

- `package/module/async-time/src/index.ts`: waiting and timeout operations.
- `package/module/async-iter/src/map-iterable-async.ts`:
  starting asynchronous operations before collecting results with `Promise.all`.
- `AGENTS.md`, `PP1` and `PP2`: implementation uses `async`/`await`
  and Promise combinators rather than callback chains or explicit Promise constructors.

Repository code establishes available examples and implementation conventions,
not the human learner's knowledge.
The user then specified a role-play learner rather than their personal knowledge.

### Confirmed learner and destination

Starting point:

- Independently build a JavaScript hello-world program.
- Build a single-file HTML page whose script prompts for a name
  and renders `Hello <name>` in the DOM.
- Nothing beyond that is established.

The lesson should enable the learner to independently build a browser AI chat application with:

- No dependencies.
- Rate limiting.
- Accepted cancellation requests.
- Exponential retries.
- Tolerance of AI API faults.
- Multiple chat threads.

The learner must also be prepared to present the application to an interviewer.
Promises are therefore part of an application-building learning path,
not the complete learning objective.
Supplying a working application or a clickable demo alone would not establish independent ability.
The lesson must account for prerequisites absent from the confirmed starting point
and provide opportunities to build and explain rather than only inspect supplied code.

### Rejected clarification: Q5

The assistant asked:

> What AI API setup should the learner’s finished application target?
>
> Describe the service or API contract, who will use the application,
> and who supplies API access. No actual credentials are needed.
>
> My recommendation for the lesson itself: include an offline, controllable API simulator
> so the learner can deliberately trigger delays, failures, and cancellations,
> then teach the real-service connection explicitly.
> The simulator should support learning and testing,
> not masquerade as a finished AI integration.

The user called this a textbook wrong question,
challenged its relevance,
and required it to become a counterexample in the skill.
They required confirmation of the assistant's understanding even if the assistant thinks it understands.

The prior plan made the real API and credential boundary a blocker
and framed the remaining discovery as an application contract.
That plan is withdrawn.

The user confirmed the central explanation:
the assistant confused an application-building learning destination with a product specification.
They added these required distinctions:

- Asking someone whose established knowledge ends at `Hello <name>` to choose an API setup
  invites a non-answer such as "maybe A".
  Treating that answer as an informed requirement would mislead the teacher.
- Applications shown in interviews do not need to be production applications.
- The focus is `Promise`, not AI.
- An offline, semi-deterministic simulated API with randomness is the appropriate teaching fixture.
  This is settled; do not ask the user to choose it again.

The confirmed counterexample must teach the agent to choose incidental teaching fixtures itself,
keep the requested subject central,
and ask questions the learner is equipped to answer.
Clarification should improve the lesson rather than manufacture unreliable requirements.

Independent advisor review also identified the novice-knowledge mismatch
and the inappropriate product-specification framing before the user confirmed them.

## Initial lesson implementation direction

This was the direction used for the first prototype.
The user's critique and proposed acceptance checks identify why it was insufficient;
do not treat it as the blueprint for a repaired lesson.

The initial action was to build the authorized `*.local.html`.
Use repeatable fault scenarios and an optional random mode for the offline API.
The simulated chat application gives Promise behavior a concrete purpose;
it is not a production AI integration project.
Provide prerequisites at the point of use without assuming more than the confirmed starting point.
Use actual Promise behavior in interactions and distinguish observation of a supplied demo
from independent building and interview explanation.

## Current artifact and verification

`doc/planning/promises-teaching.local.html` now exists and remains ignored by `.gitignore`'s `*.local.*` rule.
The user requested writing in chunks of 200 to 500 lines to avoid API timeout errors;
large additions have been split across tool calls.

The artifact contains:

- A progression from named functions and event callbacks to Promise states,
  `async`/`await`, rejection, timers, retries, rate limiting, cancellation, and conversation ownership.
- Actual Promise settlement and continuation-order experiments.
- An offline chat fixture with repeatable scenarios and seeded-random per-attempt choices.
- A sandboxed, network-disabled code workshop with starters, hints, and worked repairs.
- Exercises for cancellation, timeout causes, a shared rate gate,
  invalid fulfillment values, and destination ownership before the independent capstone.
- Downloadable learner HTML, reference HTML, and critique notes.
- System-following theme, print expansion, sources, and a visible critique path back to Pi.

Independent advisor review identified a prerequisite gap before the capstone.
The added gate, timeout, validation, and fixed-conversation exercises address that concern structurally.
Other implemented review corrections distinguish cancellation from failure,
show measured start gaps,
explain the gate's lack of FIFO fairness,
state per-attempt random probabilities,
and warn that retrying a real timeout can duplicate remote side effects.
The simulator tracks displayed conversation histories but deliberately does not simulate model memory.

Initial browser load succeeded with no reported page errors.
The rendered document had one `main`, eight chapters, and no horizontal overflow at a 1,280-pixel viewport.
The initial screenshot is `~/temp/agent/promises-lesson-first.png`.
These are smoke checks, not completed interaction verification or evidence of learner mastery.

The browser verification driver is `~/temp/agent/verify-promises-lesson.ts`.
It uses the isolated `promises-lesson-verify` session and exercises controls,
expected broken starters and worked repairs,
service scenarios,
cancellation phases,
reset races,
seed replay,
and downloads.
The complete interaction driver subsequently passed in process `proc_7c0a`.
Its log is `/tmp/pi-processes-uCxua0/proc_7c0a-stdout.log`.
The first attempts exposed harness assumptions, not lesson defects:
CSS iframe selection failed,
native eval stayed in the main frame,
a completion predicate mistakenly treated "Attempt timed out" as pending,
and a nested selector string was incorrectly escaped.
The frame bridge and corrected assertions yielded the completed passing run.
The tool-specific scope evidence is in
[`agent-browser-iframe-evaluation.md`](../troubleshooting/agent-browser-iframe-evaluation.md).

`~/temp/agent/verify-promises-delivery.ts` then exercised the downloaded reference and learner HTML,
adversarial source text containing a mixed-case closing script tag,
network-offline use,
light and dark themes,
a 390-pixel viewport,
and actual PDF/Print lifecycle behavior.
A fresh-session rerun with an assertion requiring an empty page-error record passed as `proc_648b`.
The disposable verification browser was closed.

The generated PDF contained 29 pages, measured with `pdfinfo`.
Its first and sixth pages were rendered with `pdftoppm` and inspected.
Screenshots are under `~/temp/agent/` with the `promises-lesson-`, `promises-chat-`,
and `promises-print-` prefixes.
These verify rendering and operation, not pedagogical success.

The exact lesson has been opened in Helium through the separate user-facing
`promises-lesson-present` browser session.
The page reported the correct file URL, document title, eight chapters, and two initial conversations.
Its scroll offset was already 1,728 pixels when inspected;
no reset to the top was performed, to avoid disrupting possible user interaction.
KWin then verified the Helium window as active, non-minimized, and on the current output `DP-2`.
Its measured frame was 1,018 by 744 pixels.
The global system journal, not the user-only journal, retained the `PI_PROMISES_LESSON_VISIBLE` record.
A later browser probe still reported the correct visible file and a changed scroll position;
focus was no longer on the page at that later moment.
No claim of sustained keyboard focus is made.
The temporary KWin script was unloaded without closing the user's lesson window.

The delivered local file's SHA-256 is
`dd9df982e76e4d4e4d7db9def3236a1f2f75af354637c4ae7074c3b4606f90ef`.
The artifact served as the concrete example for the recorded critique.
It is not an accepted or proven teaching method.

## User critique of the first built lesson

The user reported "tons of failures" and gave an unfinished list.
Preserve these individually rather than treating them as cosmetic wording fixes:

- A lesson targets a learner profile, not one specific learner's biography.
  `"Hello, name" page` will not be immediately clear to everyone with the specified skills.
- "Learn `Promise`" is wrong framing for someone who does not know what a Promise is.
- "chat" is undefined.
- "wait, fail, retry, and stop" are undefined.
- "You need only your existing ability to edit and open a single HTML file" is misplaced.
  The user wrote: "We should constrain ourselves and the learner to only what they already know",
  then said teaching a tool or related thing that substantially improves the objective is fine.
  Editing one HTML file is not much of a bottleneck here;
  the user contrasted teaching "WAPI or something".
  The user's answer in "Addition-to-multiplication example" grounds this boundary in instructional sequence,
  rather than a blanket ban on new tools or concepts.
- "The pretend chat service" uses an undefined and potentially misleading term.
- Code lacks syntax highlighting despite an existing repository facility.
- "defining" and "display" are under-defined.
- "Let the browser call a function on a click" teaches the browser user's action-to-outcome model,
  not the developer's model of attaching a click event listener to a button
  and supplying the function it runs.
  See "Role-appropriate mental models and questions with prior thought".
- "A service request" is vague and misleading when the experiment waits for the learner's intervention.
- "stopping the whole page" is under-backed;
  the JavaScript thread model needs clarification.
- "now" is under-specified because JavaScript has multiple relevant notions of timing.
- The paragraph explaining objects is good but belongs before the paragraph depending on it.
- Pending, Fulfilled, and Rejected cards look clickable despite not being clickable.
  They also miss an opportunity to show code in each state.
- `Promise.withResolvers()` introduces another failure:
  the lesson has not established enough pain or shown how people managed the need
  before Promises were specified and shipped.
- "resolved is not always the same as fulfilled" needs a concrete example.
- The user emphasized:
  "This is HTML. Take advantage of it. There is a reason the format isn't interactive PDF or something."

### Verified repository evidence for highlighting

A targeted dependency and filename search found the Lezer highlighting implementation:

- `package/ssg/aquati.cat/src/lib/rehype-highlight.ts` parses supported languages
  and writes token-offset attributes onto code nodes during the build.
- `package/ssg/aquati.cat/src/client/highlight-groups.ts` defines token groups.
- `package/ssg/aquati.cat/src/style/highlight.ts` supplies CSS Custom Highlight styles.

The implementation exists and was missed during the initial lesson construction.
Its standalone integration has not yet been verified;
inspect the client registration, dependencies, and consumers before prescribing reuse mechanics.

### Design implications still being tested

Independent review supports distinguishing these concerns:

- Profile-based framing and accessible goals.
- Definitions at adequate depth, separately from prerequisite ordering.
- Accurate causal models that match the actual experiment,
  not merely more citations or a renamed simulator.
- Establishing the need and predecessor mechanism before introducing an abstraction,
  without assuming every subject needs an exhaustive historical survey.
- HTML interactions that reveal concepts and honest action affordances,
  not additional controls for their own sake.

These are candidate generalizations, not a user-confirmed final skill design.
Technical checks established operational behavior, not pedagogical adequacy.

## Addition-to-multiplication example

The user answered the prior-knowledge question with a concrete teaching sequence:

- Present an apple and arrange a row of three apples.
  The learner can establish its count using familiar addition: `1 + 2 = 3`.
- Arrange another aligned row of three.
  The learner can establish the combined count: `3 + 3 = 6`.
- Add another row and let the repeated counting expose why the current method becomes unwieldy.
- Introduce multiplication, then the multiplication table, in response to that need.

Their contrast is opening with a multiplication table instead of building this understanding.
The example establishes the importance of concrete representations,
known reasoning,
visible structure,
and a problem that motivates the next abstraction before its name or reference material arrives.

The assistant's interpretation is that new tools and concepts are allowed,
but require a bridge from the learner's established understanding.
The Promises page reversed that order by naming the abstraction and listing its features
before sufficiently establishing the problem it solves.

When asked what to do if the learner counts correctly but sees no reason to change methods,
the user answered: "Scale up. There WILL be a point where they fail."
Increase the same problem's demands until the current method's limitation is observable.
Introduce the new method in response to that demonstrated need,
rather than merely asserting that counting is cumbersome or narrating an unobserved realization.
This is evidence about the method's limits, not a judgment about the learner.
Do not assume a required lockstep UI, forced quiz, or exhaustive historical survey.

## Role-appropriate mental models and questions with prior thought

The assistant asked:
"You called 'Let the browser call a function on a click' misleading.
What incorrect understanding would that phrasing give the learner?"
The user challenged whether the assistant genuinely failed to see the problem.

The assistant then overcorrected toward not asking the user to diagnose its wording.
The user clarified that questions are welcome, but must show thinking first.
Their challenge was a probe of the assistant's understanding, not a ban on asking.
Do not turn this correction into a rule against clarification questions.

The user supplied the distinction:

- A generic browser user clicks a button and things happen.
- The learner is becoming a developer.
  The developer attaches a click event listener to the button;
  when triggered, it runs a function.

The heading replaces the mechanism the developer must construct with the outcome a browser user observes.
The assistant should have inferred that mismatch before asking.
A question should start from a reasoned interpretation and investigate a remaining uncertainty,
not ask the user to perform the initial analysis of an already-identified failure.

Teach the causal model appropriate to the learner's intended role.
Accessible wording must not erase the relationships the learner needs to create, inspect, or explain.
This also guides independent review of the remaining under-defined or misleading lesson language.

The user explicitly said not to edit `AGENTS.md` for now.
Keep the teaching-specific correction and rejected question in these planning notes.
No final skill is authorized until shared understanding is confirmed.

The assistant checked MDN's `addEventListener()` and `dispatchEvent()` documentation while investigating.
The first distinguishes registering a listener on a target from invoking it;
the second documents synchronous programmatic dispatch.
These checks must not replace the user's central role-and-mental-model distinction
with an unrelated lecture on scheduling exceptions.

- <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/dispatchEvent>

## Requirements synthesis review

`teaching-skill-acceptance.md` groups proposed checks by learner framing,
observable problems and causal explanations,
HTML and print behavior,
and verification evidence.
It keeps the cooking, apples, and Promise examples as concrete acceptance cases.

Independent advisor review prompted these corrections before confirmation:

- Apply failure-driven scaling when an abstraction addresses an existing method's limitation,
  not as a universal prerequisite for teaching every fact.
- Preserve the requested real pre-Promise callback history,
  separately from the Promise constructor pattern that precedes `Promise.withResolvers()`.
- Preserve all reasons Q5 failed without banning pedagogically relevant audience questions.
- Separate artifact behavior, content review, teaching-effectiveness evidence, and demonstrated mastery.

At that synthesis stage, the highlighter's producer, consumer, registration, and style paths were inspected,
but standalone integration had not yet been built or verified.
No lesson rewrite, skill implementation, or `AGENTS.md` edit had occurred during that synthesis.

## Rejected premature confirmation checkpoint

After collecting the critique and writing acceptance checks,
the assistant asked whether shared understanding had been reached.
The user rejected that progression:
"We haven't weeded out all failure modes, even just in the Promise toy example."
They requested the updated Promise toy first.

Recording and classifying failures does not establish that they have been resolved or exhausted.
The assistant must demonstrate its interpretation through a materially revised teaching artifact,
then continue discovery from that artifact's failures.
The acceptance proposal is not an approved design or a reason to close the interview.

## Revised prototype reconstruction

The first artifact is preserved at `doc/planning/promises-teaching-first.local.html`.
Its SHA-256 still matches the recorded first-delivery hash.
Both HTML files remain ignored and local-only.

Current authoring sources are in `~/temp/agent/promises-revision/`:

- `opening.html`: target preview, concrete function motivation,
  separate call/return/DOM behavior, listener wiring, data, and delayed-return foundations.
- `promise-sequence.html`: callback coordination, Promise construction and states,
  adoption, collection, and scoped execution-order explanations.
- `advanced.html`: audited downstream explanations and workshop scaffolding.
- `basic-samples.html`: executable source for the revised foundation labs and their comparisons.
- `labs.mjs`: source-backed sandboxed previews, report helper, and standalone example downloads.
- `revision.css`: responsive side-by-side code/output presentation, read-only state cues, and print styles.
- `highlight.mjs` and `bundle-highlight.mjs`: the installed Lezer grammars and actual repository tag mapping,
  bundled for offline use in static code and native textarea mirrors.
- `preview-snapshot.mjs` and `print.mjs`: text-only snapshots from owned opaque frames,
  current-draft/run distinctions, and the complete example/workshop print catalog.
- `verify-presentation.mjs`: highlighting, source identity, boundary strings, scrolling,
  forced-color fallback, layouts, PDF content inventory, and disclosure restoration.
- `launch-print-browser.mjs`, `cdp-page.mjs`, and `verify-native-print.mjs`:
  real Helium Print/Cancel verification inside an off-screen Cage compositor.
- `verify-advanced.mjs`: adapted application, workshop, and export checks using exact preview run identities.
- `build.mjs` and `mise.toml`: assemble the single local HTML using the preserved runtime modules.
- `frame-eval.mjs`: direct CDP evaluation of a particular opaque-origin preview.
  It matches a document title including the preview's run identity,
  so it cannot silently inspect the previous navigation.
- `verify-foundations.mjs`: behavioral checks of the reconstructed foundations.

Run assembly and foundation checks from the scratch authoring directory with
`mise run build` and `mise run test:foundations`.
The authoring task passes the repository path explicitly;
the resulting lesson needs no build tool or server to open.

The expanded foundation pass succeeded as process `proc_14db`:

- The target preview accepts another action while preserving the originally sent message.
- Defining, calling, receiving a primitive return, and assigning to the DOM remain distinguishable.
- The greeting button does nothing before listener attachment or after removal.
- Array counts and comparisons drive the shown branch.
- Zero-delay and delayed timers cannot retroactively replace an already-returned primitive.
- A naive last-started completion rule works at count one and fails when scaled.
- The valid callback repair and Promise collection preserve input order and report the first failure once.
- Empty-input collection behavior is correct, with the callback/Promise observer timing difference visible.
- Constructor execution, return, and fulfillment observation have the explained order.
- A distinct outer Promise adopts either inner outcome despite a competing direct resolution attempt.
- The page-error record is empty.

The build in that pass produced 159,816 bytes.
These checks establish implemented behavior, not that the revised teaching is accepted or sufficient.

Independent reconstruction review identified additional gaps which were addressed in the source:
prerequisites before callback coordination,
actual callback history rather than a Node-only contract presented as generic browser behavior,
matching collection policies,
no imaginary public Promise state field,
and explicit distinctions between real execution and teaching instrumentation.
The first independent review of the rebuilt text timed out without returning findings.
A subsequent GLM review returned actionable and incorrect findings.
The text now explicitly motivates `Promise.withResolvers()` through the constructor-and-capture predecessor,
acknowledges that separating creation from controls is a choice,
and gives concrete `typeof` examples.

The review's proposed removal of the printed greeting transformation was rejected after checking the browser source:
`loadExercise()` itself changes the greeting comparison from `Hello` to `Welcome`.
The print catalog deliberately matches it.
The presentation driver now compares every printed workshop comparison with its actual browser counterpart.
The review's claim that the adoption distinction was missing was also rejected:
the section explicitly says that a resolved Promise can still be pending and can eventually reject,
and the experiment verifies both outcomes.
Review output is evidence to check, not a reason to alter correct content blindly.

## Revised presentation verification

The historical `mise run test:all` pass `proc_cc0f` ran assembly,
foundations, presentation, and native Print/Cancel checks.
At that point the task did not yet include the advanced app/workshop regression pass;
that separate adapted driver ran as `proc_cf10`.
Its chat scenarios, workshop starters/repairs, explicit Stop branch,
capstone, navigation, and downloads passed.
Its final empty-error assertion failed because agent-browser retained the deliberately injected
`revised-lesson-error-positive-control` despite `errors --clear`.
The installed native handler ignores that flag;
isolate the positive control in a separate disposable browser rather than filtering errors.

Implemented presentation behavior includes:

- Desktop lab source and actual output appear side by side; narrow layouts stack them.
- Source colors reuse `ssgHighlighter` from `package/ssg/aquati.cat/src/client/tags.ts`.
  The highlighting bundle is self-contained and is not a learner-app dependency.
- Every editor remains a labeled native textarea.
  Typed source, colored source, executed source, reset/comparison states,
  scroll positions, and forced-color fallback were checked.
- Editing without Run is explicitly labeled as an unrun draft.
  Printing identifies both the draft and the source which produced the latest observed output.
- Every foundation starter and comparison,
  every workshop task, starter, hint, and worked comparison,
  current drafts, current settings, notes, and reported preview output are inventoried for print.
- Every inventoried item was found in text extracted from an actual generated PDF.
  This is stronger than checking a DOM copy but does not replace visual PDF review.
- Static alternatives remain in the teaching path;
  browser interactivity was not removed to obtain print support.
- Owned previews publish literal text snapshots with their run identity.
  Their sandbox still omits `allow-same-origin`.
  No snapshot is interpreted as HTML.

The headless Print-button check was initially misdiagnosed as a PDF restoration bug.
PDF generation and all its content checks had passed;
the failed assertion followed a new Print click whose cycle had not ended.
The unnecessary implementation patch was removed.
Native Helium verification now opens the real Print UI,
waits for an enabled Print/Save action,
activates Cancel,
and verifies `afterprint` plus restoration of mixed disclosure states.
It does not submit a physical printer job.
See `doc/troubleshooting/agent-browser-print-lifecycle.md`.

The forced-color check inspects rendering in the CDP session which applied that condition.
A separate-client null result was not treated as a tested forced-color state.
See `doc/troubleshooting/agent-browser-emulation-session.md`.

Current visual evidence in `~/temp/agent/promises-revision/`:

- `revised-code-light.png` and `revised-code-dark.png`.
- `revised-code-mobile.png` and `revised-goal-mobile.png`.
- `revised-lesson-print.pdf`, its extracted text, and `print-inventory.json`.
- `native-print-preview.png`, showing the enabled native print action and Cancel control.
  It is not evidence that the embedded PDF preview had finished painting.

The native print verifier used the off-screen browser in process `proc_e7c6`.
It reads `print-profile-path.txt` and that profile's `DevToolsActivePort`, rather than hardcoding an endpoint.
The process was stopped after verification.
No claim is retained about the original presentation window's current existence or contents.
The original HTML file itself remains preserved.

## Final revised verification and visible handoff

The verified revised HTML is 400,193 bytes.
It contains 14 chapters, ten foundation labs, ten workshop choices, and eleven native code editors.
The post-presentation file SHA-256 is
`d912a4ac357bb84a86a4dc7bc9d522d6a982273b559a800547c9c78ae0f155ba`.
This was recorded after presentation, not captured by the earlier test run.
The original file's SHA-256 remains
`dd9df982e76e4d4e4d7db9def3236a1f2f75af354637c4ae7074c3b4606f90ef`.
Both HTML artifacts remain ignored and local-only.

`mise run test:all` passed as `proc_28b9` in 104 seconds.
The task now sequentially runs assembly, foundations, presentation, native Print/Cancel,
the isolated error-channel positive control, and the advanced regression driver.
The advanced driver uses a fresh error record and finishes with a genuinely empty record;
it does not filter the positive-control text from lesson errors.
Its coverage includes policy outcomes, cancellation during each asynchronous phase,
conversation ownership, shared spacing, seeded decisions,
workshop starters and repairs, the explicit Stop branch, capstone controls, navigation, and downloads.
Capstone controls passing is not evidence of independent learner mastery.

The separate `mise run test:exports` passed as `proc_f17b` in 18 seconds.
It reopened and exercised the actual reference and learner downloads,
all ten foundation downloads, and an edited source-boundary example.
The boundary text remained literal and did not inject an image or unexpected page error.
The reference handled success and cancellation; the learner greeting ran independently.
A reachable loopback HTTP canary became blocked in a fresh browser launched through a non-forwarding proxy,
without increasing the origin's canary count.
The proxy also rejects CONNECT in its implementation;
there was no separate HTTPS-canary test or physical-disconnection test.
A pre-reload `navigator.onLine` check is not used as proof that the reloaded document was offline.

Print evidence now covers 503 independently collected teaching entries and 62 appendix entries.
Every entry was found in extracted PDF text using whitespace-normalized comparisons.
This checks inventoried text, not every page's visual layout or exact source whitespace.
The PDF has 82 Letter pages and is 1,672,499 bytes.
Pages 1, 2, 23, 32, 39, and 78 were rendered and visually inspected.
Not every PDF page was visually inspected.
Static rejection choices include the answer;
static chat paths include every scenario, simultaneous sends, Stop, and a paper-tracing exercise.
Printed external source links expose their destinations.
The browser's interactivity remains available rather than being removed to make printing easier.

The latest independent GLM review found no consequential causal error or blocking prerequisite
in the visible excerpts supplied to it.
That is bounded source review, not exhaustive content approval or learner evidence.
Runtime verification was in Chromium/Helium, not Firefox ESR 140.
User critique of this revision is still required for discovery.

Required tool investigations are recorded in:

- `doc/troubleshooting/agent-browser-errors-clear.md`:
  isolate deliberate error-monitor failures from the lesson's record.
  The existing upstream patch also passed before/after component checks in `proc_10a7`;
  this did not rebuild or replace the installed CLI.
- `doc/troubleshooting/agent-browser-partial-viewport-click.md`:
  scroll and verify the actual click point before interpreting a download timeout.
  A private selector-geometry prototype also passed real pointer checks;
  the installed tool remains unchanged, and the additive upstream comment is only a local draft.
- `doc/troubleshooting/agent-browser-offline-verification.md`:
  use a positively tested rejecting proxy rather than assuming emulation state survives navigation.
- `doc/troubleshooting/agent-browser-print-lifecycle.md` and
  `doc/troubleshooting/agent-browser-emulation-session.md`:
  distinguish completed native cycles and same-session observations from premature or unmeasured assertions.

The revised artifact was opened in headed Helium session `promises-revised-present`,
in tab `revised-promises`, at its exact file URL.
The title is `Build the connections behind a chat: revised Promise lesson`.
Browser inspection confirmed its chapter/lab counts and ready highlighting/print material.
KWin inspection confirmed the matching window active, non-minimized, and on the selected output `DP-2`
at the time of handoff.
The page was left at `#goal-preview`, with that preview fully in the viewport.
The temporary KWin activation script was unloaded afterward.
This is a handoff-time observation, not a claim of sustained focus.

Visible handoff captures:
`~/temp/agent/promises-revision/revised-visible-handoff.png` and `revised-visible-goal.png`.
The disposable native-print process `proc_e7c6` and rejecting-proxy process `proc_f6d4` were stopped.
Successful disposable verification drivers close their sessions.
The remaining ended print controller was closed without its expired CDP endpoint;
a fresh session list contained only `promises-revised-present`.
The owned print and export profiles were removed.
To repeat verification, `ui:print` and `ui:offline-fixture` recreate their respective setup;
those services are not left running after delivery.
Keep the user-facing `promises-revised-present` window open.

## Opening preview rejected: observable mechanics without a human purpose

The user quoted the opening instructions about sending a message,
editing the box, pressing an independent-action button, and receiving the original text back.
Their assessment: "This is extremely confusing and detached from any kind of real world example."

Source inspection confirms the problem is not confined to that paragraph:

- `~/temp/agent/promises-revision/opening.html:9` introduces a sequence of test actions,
  not a person with a reason to use the application.
- `~/temp/agent/promises-revision/basic-samples.html:1` supplies an echo,
  an unrelated counter, and a 1,200 ms window for the prescribed actions.
- `opening.html:53` also uses resetting that counter to motivate functions.
  Replacing only the opening prose would leave the same disconnected example downstream.

The assistant confused an observable implementation property with a meaningful application problem.
Captured-input and responsiveness checks can verify code,
but they do not explain why anyone would send this message or want its echoed reply.
"Independent action" names the experimenter's classification, not an understandable activity.
The opening also foregrounds a programmer's input-capture concern before establishing the user's task.
Passing the mechanical checks did not address this failure.

A proposed illustrative replacement is a hypothetical shop-support conversation:
ask whether Saturday delivery is available,
then draft a question about delivery cost while the answer is pending.
The sent question belongs in a visible transcript;
the answer should address that question without overwriting the unfinished follow-up.
The example must disclose that the shop and response delay are simulated locally.
This is an illustration of the correction, not an accepted final scenario or an implemented change.

Independent review confirmed a substantive replacement needs different behavior,
not shop-themed labels on the echo and counter:

- Meaningful answers must depend on the sent question, rather than repeating arbitrary text.
- Sending adds the question to the transcript and makes the composer available for the next draft.
- The later answer is appended to the conversation; the unsent draft remains in the composer.
- Observation must not depend on completing a typing-and-clicking race within the delay.
- The function motivation should distinguish rerunning initialization from invoking a selected operation,
  with conversation or draft state providing the meaningful consequence.
- Neither responsiveness, captured input, nor draft preservation should be attributed automatically to Promises.

Abstract mechanism experiments are not prohibited.
Their question needs an understandable purpose before the experiment's controls become the learner's task.
No final skill confirmation or `AGENTS.md` edit follows from this critique.

## Grounded shop opening implementation

The user explicitly instructed the assistant to implement the correction after the assistant had only described it.
Do not substitute another explanation or confirmation request for applying that authorized change.

The rejected mechanical revision is preserved as
`doc/planning/promises-teaching-mechanical-preview.local.html`.
The original prototype remains separately preserved.
All teaching HTML artifacts remain local-only.

Implemented changes in `~/temp/agent/promises-revision/`:

- `opening.html` supplies a reason to ask about delivery before ordering,
  a Saturday question, and an unfinished cost question.
- `shop-preview.html` and `shop-preview.css` provide a conversation and composer,
  with the lesson's reply-advance control outside the shop interface.
- `basic-samples.html` answers the sent question from local rules,
  appends messages rather than replacing the conversation,
  and leaves the unsent follow-up untouched when an answer arrives.
- Replies advance through a clearly disclosed lesson control,
  not a typing race against a timer or an unrelated counter.
- Empty questions, repeated reply activation, pending sends, unsupported questions,
  and literal markup are handled without granting new sandbox permissions.
- The function explanation contrasts invoking the sending operation with rerunning initialization,
  using actual conversation and draft state instead of the counter.
- `build.mjs` reuses the same static shop trace in the lesson and downloaded shop.
- `labs.mjs` accepts bounded layout measurements only from the current owned shop frame,
  keeping its composer in the page's scrolling flow without granting same-origin access.

The focused native-control and embedding check passed as `proc_8ab5`.
It exercised the actual downloaded file, distinct Saturday/cost answers, preserved draft/history,
input boundaries, a deliberately wrong live-draft lookup, print snapshots, and restarting.
A subsequent label correction makes the lesson-control heading describe its purpose,
not falsely say that a reply is paused after it has already arrived.

The first implementation worked standalone but its form-submit path did not operate in the opaque preview.
Direct button click wiring replaced that path without relaxing the sandbox;
the embedded conversation then passed.
A later restart assertion selected the iframe's `data-run` attribute instead of the button.
The verifier now selects `button[data-run]` explicitly.
Neither failure was treated as evidence to weaken isolation or erase unrelated checks.

### Verification corrections

`proc_76ab` passed the shop's interaction and layout-message controls,
then waited for mobile layout before bringing its frame into view.
The frame's top was 1131.78125 CSS pixels in an 844-pixel-high viewport.
After scrolling it into view, its reported height changed from 711 to 918 CSS pixels.
The verifier now exposes the actual target before checking its rendered size.
This observation does not establish a general browser scheduling cause.

That failed wait also exposed a helper lifetime error:
Node reported `Warning: Detected unsettled top-level await` and exited with status 13.
`frame-eval.mjs` could create a new protocol request after its deadline had drained pending requests.
It now checks the deadline and socket before sending, and rejects outstanding requests on socket closure.
`proc_ab8a` passed a true-predicate control and a deliberately false predicate:
the latter reported its deadline and input with status 1, without an unsettled-await warning.

`proc_0ee5` passed the first complete shop revision.
Print review then prompted copy corrections:
"message box" replaces the unexplained "composer" in the paper trace;
the source reference identifies the lesson's JavaScript appendix rather than claiming complete runnable HTML;
and the appendix explains that visual wrapping does not insert source-code line breaks.

`proc_3299` passed the rebuilt shop, foundations, and PDF/presentation checks,
then exposed a premature native Cancel-control assertion.
The corrected driver waits for both Cancel and Print/Save to be enabled.
Evidence and the distinct cleanup boundary are recorded in
`doc/troubleshooting/agent-browser-print-lifecycle.md`.

### Current verification and handoff

The complete current suite passed as `proc_e6a1`, `mise run test:all`, in 126 seconds.
It includes shop interaction and layout-message positive/negative controls,
foundations, highlighting, PDF content, native Print/Cancel, and advanced policies/workshops.
The deliberate error-channel control remains separate from the lesson's unexpected-error record.

The separate reopened-export suite passed as `proc_4ae5` in 17 seconds.
It exercises the downloaded shop's distinct exchanges and retained draft/history,
the reference application, learner file, every foundation download,
and an edited boundary-string export.
The proxy probe positively verifies HTTP-canary denial.
It does not test an HTTPS canary, every transport, physical disconnection, or learner independence.

Measured after these runs:

- `doc/planning/promises-teaching.local.html`: 413111 bytes;
  SHA-256 `aedb13c57ae4b49c22659a9dfb5ed12023d59ed89bb103ab45b2f4525fea9229`.
- Original prototype SHA-256 remains
  `dd9df982e76e4d4e4d7db9def3236a1f2f75af354637c4ae7074c3b4606f90ef`.
- Preserved mechanical-preview SHA-256 remains
  `d912a4ac357bb84a86a4dc7bc9d522d6a982273b559a800547c9c78ae0f155ba`.
- Current PDF: 85 Letter pages, 1707506 bytes, tagged Skia/PDF m149.
- PDF checks found 516 independently collected teaching entries and 62 appendix entries.
  Comparisons normalize whitespace; they do not establish exact indentation or source-line fidelity.
- `proc_6adb` rendered current PDF pages 1, 2, 4, 51, and 52.
  Those images were visually inspected, not every PDF page.
  They are `~/temp/agent/promises-revision/shop-print-review-<page>.png`.

`proc_5218` opened the corrected file in headed Helium session `promises-shop-present`.
The final print-copy revision was then reloaded after checking that notes, edited code,
conversation activity, and practice state were still at their initial values.
The loaded page was checked for the new heading, current print wording,
and ready highlighting/print material.

The final handoff was activated on the then-current output `DP-3`.
KWin reported the matching Helium window active and non-minimized,
with a 1018 by 744 frame; its activation script was unloaded afterward.
The shop was left ready at the Saturday question, not pre-completed for the user.
Its whole 599-CSS-pixel preview fitted within the measured 676-pixel browser viewport.
`shop-visible-ready.png` records that presentation;
`shop-visible-opening.png` records the contextual opening before scrolling to the shop.
This is handoff-time visibility, not sustained focus or proof the user read it.

The current mobile screenshot was also inspected.
The conversation and unfinished cost question remain distinct;
vertical movement uses the containing page, without horizontal document overflow in the tested viewport.

Advisor reviewed the supplied implementation and conversation evidence for the specific counter/echo criticism.
It found a material behavioral correction rather than a reskin and no consequential contradiction in that scope.
That was not an independent exhaustive source audit or human teaching acceptance.
Firefox ESR 140 remains the compatibility target, not a runtime tested by these Chromium/Helium checks.

Owned failed verification browsers and the shared foundation browser were closed.
The native-print and proxy fixtures were stopped, and their disposable print/export profiles were removed.
The print controller was closed without reusing the ended endpoint.
The presentation session remains open; the unrelated `music-player-android-presets` session was left alone.
Future full verification must recreate `ui:print` and `ui:offline-fixture`, not reuse their stale endpoint files.

## User correction: chat sending must not wait for a reply

The user rejected the send lock:
"This chat isn't how it works. No chat app blocks you from sending your next message
before the other party replies."

The assistant had turned an optional unfinished draft into forced turn-taking.
`basic-samples.html` explicitly set `send.disabled = true` after sending,
and `verify-shop.mjs` asserted that this restriction was correct.
Those tests encoded the invented policy rather than checking an authentic chat interaction.
The prior operational passes and Advisor review did not establish the teaching model's validity.

`mise run test:shop-sending` reproduced this failure through a native click in the actual downloaded shop.
Process `proc_2aae` failed in two seconds with:

```text
AssertionError [ERR_ASSERTION]: Sending the Saturday question must not disable sending while its reply is pending
true !== false
```

This is an explicit authored policy, not an unexplained intermittent defect.
There is no reason to invent competing runtime hypotheses or investigate an external chat vendor.
The correction must keep sending independent of reply arrival.
Simply enabling Send is insufficient:
the old one-shot listeners would all execute on the same reply-control click.
Pending replies need their own captured sent messages and deliberate delivery handling.

The revised opening should demonstrate sending both delivery questions before receiving either answer.
Leaving a question unfinished remains an optional path, never a required wait.
The separate teaching control can pause and reveal fixture replies without locking the shop's Send control.
A fixture's reply ordering must be identified as a fixture policy, not a universal rule of chat.

Potential future skill guidance, not an `AGENTS.md` edit or approved final skill:
control the mechanism being demonstrated without silently restricting independent user actions.
Test against the real activity, not solely against the implementation's own invented rules.

## User requirement: neutral long-form backgrounds

The user specified:
"For long form content, cap the biggest bg's color saturation/chroma at 0.
This is to prevent eye fatigue."

The lesson's main reading backgrounds must be achromatic in both light and dark themes.
Purposeful accents and controls may retain color;
the continuous reading surface must not acquire its hue from the accent palette.
Record this as a requirement for the eventual teaching skill, not a proposed preference question.
No `AGENTS.md` change is authorized in this discovery session.

## Independent-sending and neutral-surface progress

The send-locked artifact is preserved as `doc/planning/promises-teaching-send-locked.local.html`,
SHA-256 `aedb13c57ae4b49c22659a9dfb5ed12023d59ed89bb103ab45b2f4525fea9229`.

The opening now keeps Send enabled, captures each sent message in its own callback,
and uses one lesson-control listener to remove and invoke one stored reply at a time.
The list is identified as application data, not a browser task or microtask queue.
The fixture's one-reply/in-order behavior is disclosed, not presented as a universal chat rule.
The primary path sends both questions before either reply; an unfinished draft is optional.
History scrolls in a bounded keyboard-accessible region and expands for print.

`proc_1d81` passed focused build/shop checks.
`proc_1b08` additionally passed trusted native pointer clicks in the opaque iframe,
multiple pending replies, a history-overflow control, restart with pending work,
and a deliberately broken once-listener fan-out example that the one-reply assertion rejects.
The integer-coordinate correction to that verifier is documented in
`doc/troubleshooting/agent-browser-mouse-coordinates.md`.

`neutral-reading.css` is inserted inside the shared `lesson-style`,
so the page, isolated previews, reference downloads, and practice downloads receive the same base palette.
The main light/dark backgrounds are `#f4f4f4` and `#1e1e1e`;
dark panels are `#292929`, and code surfaces are neutral too.
Gray values were derived from the previous colors' relative luminance, then rounded to sRGB bytes.
Long callout backgrounds are neutral; bounded accents may retain color.

`proc_d930` proved the new surface probe rejects the former background:
`lesson/light: non-neutral background on html`, `246 !== 244`.
`proc_c276` passed composited opaque/equal-RGB checks in both automatic preference modes,
the opaque shop, downloaded shop, and print.
It measures the largest background rectangle and checks selected reading surfaces;
this is not a screenshot pixel-coverage census.
Sampled visible text and syntax colors retained at least 4.5:1 measured contrast.
Light/dark screenshots were inspected. No medical eye-fatigue outcome is claimed.

`proc_fce8` passed the complete then-current suite in 140 seconds.
This covers the corrected opening and backgrounds but does not establish the later chat's missing behavior.
A downstream source audit found the same lock in the retained `chat-runtime`:
`thread.controller !== null` returns early, and `thread.sendButton.disabled = true` blocks another send.
The later teaching text also explicitly limits each conversation to one active send.
Those paths must be corrected before declaring the lesson internally consistent.

The isolated cancellation/deadline workshops are single-operation mechanism experiments,
not chat models. Their restriction must be named as exercise scope;
the reference chat and independent-build criteria must allow multiple sends in one conversation.

A fresh public session, `promises-open-chat-present`, was opened as `proc_2cb9` with title
`Promises: build a shop chat`.
KWin reported it active and non-minimized on `DP-3`.
The earlier `promises-shop-present` window and its possible user work were left untouched.
This is an interim view; reference-chat changes and final verification remain pending.

## Reference-chat correction in progress

`proc_8820` reproduced the reference download's send lock with an actual native Send activation:
`The reference chat must allow another send in the same conversation while a reply is pending`,
`true !== false`.

The scratch `chat-ui.mjs` now replaces only the retained interface module during assembly.
Every send captures its message and owns a fresh controller.
Each conversation keeps a list of pending controllers, rather than one replaceable controller slot.
Completion filters out only its own controller.
Stop aborts the current list in that conversation, while another conversation and subsequently started sends remain independent.
Send is not disabled by pending replies. The explicit demonstration send-count bound remains.

The input clears only when a message is accepted.
Per-message progress receipts remain attached to the originating sent message;
incoming replies append when received, rather than occupying a future reply slot in the history.
The pending count is distinct from the latest operation event and from input-validation feedback.
This separation prevents another send's progress from hiding a refused blank or over-bound input.
The existing reset generation still prevents old continuations and notes from entering the new experiment.

A labelled `Reset and send example messages` control clears the experiment and starts two sends in A and one in B.
It is lesson equipment, not a normal chat gesture, and removes the need for a timing race in the reference demonstration.
The existing conversation-level Stop is now labelled `Stop pending sends` to disclose its expanded pending-work scope.
It does not remove already displayed messages or replies.
The downstream fixture's one-reply-per-successful-send contract is distinguished from general chat behavior.

`proc_9dac` passed the earlier behavior checks but failed when verifier probes redeclared `card`
in the page evaluation context: `SyntaxError: Identifier 'card' has already been declared`.
The caller probes now use invocation-local declarations. This is not a lesson or third-party patch.
`proc_08c8` then passed the focused reference checks in 13 seconds.

Advisor identified missing out-of-order and stale-generation checks, not teaching acceptance.
`reference-routing-probe.mjs` temporarily replaces the policy runner only in a disposable exported page:
it controls settlement order, checks per-message association, preserves the unsent draft,
stops an unfinished send without changing a fulfilled send or another conversation,
and delivers a late note and settlement after reset.
An old-generation note visibly appears before reset as a positive control;
after reset, the old continuation leaves the current event record unchanged.
The real runner is restored before later checks.
`proc_1c52` passed the expanded focused suite in 16 seconds.
These controlled checks isolate UI ownership; they do not replace the real rate/retry/deadline tests.

Capstone source comments and hints now require multiple pending sends with per-send controllers.
The cancellation/deadline task descriptions explicitly identify their single-operation scope.
The destination exercise documents appending `sendFirst(); sendSecond();` and running the preview,
so observing its ownership defect does not require quick button clicks.
The advanced verifier is being updated to exercise those literal documented calls.
Printed task/hint/source material is generated from those same exercise definitions.

`proc_235c` stopped before writing output because new workshop-text patches were applied to the backend fragment,
which does not contain the workshop runtime. The strict unique-match guard caught the boundary error.
The metadata patches now belong in `revisedLesson`; template/UI/starter patches remain in `independentBackend`.
`proc_e6f6` passed the rebuilt reference and advanced/workshop checks in 87 seconds,
producing a 422,859-byte artifact.
The disposable clear-all-controllers mutant was rejected by the fresh-send ownership assertion;
the authored guard was never removed.
The run also exercised the documented paired destination calls, real success/failure/retry/deadline paths,
Stop during gate/request/backoff, separate conversation ownership, source downloads, and an isolated error channel.

## Combined correction verification and handoff

`proc_af31` passed `mise run test:all` followed by `mise run test:exports` in 149 seconds.
The complete stdout/stderr were inspected.
This includes native opening sends, the reference ownership checks and negative controls,
neutral light/dark/print surfaces, foundations, highlighted native editing,
PDF content inventories, native Print/Cancel, advanced policy/workshop behavior,
and actual reopened downloads through the positively tested HTTP-denying proxy.
The reopened reference accepted another send in the same conversation, preserved a draft,
and cancelled during backoff. Browser evidence is Chromium/Helium, not Firefox execution.

The resulting `doc/planning/promises-teaching.local.html` is 422,859 bytes,
SHA-256 `aef8e02094efce04096989c4e102c7416edf342e2ff0affd81b8f72c2f478e3b`.
The preserved first artifact still matches its original hash.
The PDF is 88 Letter pages and 1,754,348 bytes,
with 527 independently collected teaching entries and 62 appendix entries.
The text inventory compares normalized content; it does not establish every page's layout or exact source line breaks.

`proc_32f6` rendered measured PDF locations 1, 2, 32, 35, 47, 49, and 55.
Those pages were inspected for the opening instructions/paper trace,
reference experiment, controller ownership explanation, and relevant source.
The current light-theme opening and mobile shop capture were inspected too.
No claim is made that every PDF page received visual inspection.

`proc_6d54` opened a new tab rather than reloading possible user work:
`promises-open-chat-present`, label `independent-chat`, tab `t2`,
target `A4082053FEAAEFE227BFEA1BD0FD6225`.
The previous `t1` and the older `promises-shop-present` session remain intact.
A parent-page read confirmed the corrected controller-list interface is loaded.
The owned goal snapshot reports the initial Saturday question and no pending replies.
The rendered page exposes Send and the separate reply-control area together,
with the main background resolving to `rgb(30, 30, 30)`.
`independent-shop-visible.png` records this ready state.

The selected browser tab is `independent-chat`, with title `Promises: build a shop chat`.
A read-only KWin check reported the matching Helium window active, non-minimized,
and on its then-current output `DP-3`.
The browser viewport readback was 1274 by 612 CSS pixels;
KWin's reported window geometry was 1018 by 744 in its coordinate space.
These are separate measurements, not interchangeable geometry evidence.
The page was scrolled to expose both controls without replacing drafts or replaying the conversation.

The print and offline fixtures, `proc_8a49` and `proc_efdd`, have been stopped.
`proc_756c` successfully closed the remaining print controller and the owned headless verification session.
The owned `helium-print-profile-qZ4J6X` and `exports-profile-Yfe3Ci` directories were removed.
The final session listing retains only the current and earlier public presentation sessions.
Repository status still shows only the previously observed unrelated changes outside this documentation.
