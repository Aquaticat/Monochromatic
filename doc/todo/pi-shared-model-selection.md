# Extract model selection logic to pi-shared/model-selection

## Decisions captured here

- Keep the package at `packages/pi-shared/model-selection/` with package name
  `@monochromatic-dev/pi-shared-model-selection`.
- Use one shared package,
   but split its public surface by dependency tier with subpath exports.
- Move the full planned surface,
   including budget-model strategy orchestration.
- Leave only registry authentication and extension-host adapters in consumers.
- Use `ABSENT` and `Maybe<T>` for non-exceptional absence in shared APIs.
- Preserve lightweight consumers by keeping dependency-free helpers out of platform-coupled modules.

## Problem

Three pi plugins contain related model-selection logic,
 but the overlap is uneven.
Advisor owns most of the current surface;
 auto-mode overlaps through budget selection and version ranking;
thinking-defaults overlaps through model-id leaf parsing.
The value of the extraction is therefore a reusable pi model-selection home first,
 and duplication removal second.

Measured whole-file inventory on 2026-05-26:
 3,431 lines across 16 source files.
This is inventory size,
 not a moved-line estimate.
Some files contain consumer-specific adapters that become thinner rather than disappearing.

## Package placement

`pi-shared` is a new top-level category for reusable pi extension infrastructure that is not itself a pi extension.
A package belongs there when it is intended for two or more pi packages and its public API is reusable outside
one extension's command,
 rendering,
 or config surface.
Actual pi extensions stay under `packages/pi-plugin/`.

The repository has a nested-category precedent in `packages/claude-code-plugin/hook-type/`,
 consumed by
`packages/claude-code-plugin/source/`.
This plan intentionally chooses a top-level `pi-shared` category instead,
 so the category rule above is part of
the extraction and should be kept with the package README.

- Directory:
   `packages/pi-shared/model-selection/`
- Package name:
   `@monochromatic-dev/pi-shared-model-selection`
- Description:
   shared model selection logic for pi plugins,
   including slug resolution,
   pattern matching,
  scope resolution,
   cost ranking,
   budget-model strategy selection,
   and version extraction.

## Public export policy

Do not make the root export a broad barrel that imports every module.
The root export and `./core` export dependency-free helpers only.
Consumers import heavier modules through explicit subpaths.

- `.` and `./core`:
   dependency-free helpers and types.
- `./scope`:
   scope pattern,
   settings,
   and effective-scope helpers.
- `./cost`:
   advisor-style cost scoring and ranking helpers.
- `./budget`:
   budget-model strategy and override selection with injected auth callbacks.
- `./pi-coding-agent`:
   optional wrappers that directly import pi-coding-agent helpers,
   such as token estimation.
- `./pi-ai`:
   optional wrappers that directly import pi-ai helpers,
   if keeping `modelsAreEqual` is necessary.

Thinking-defaults imports only `@monochromatic-dev/pi-shared-model-selection/core` or the root dependency-free
surface.
Advisor and auto-mode may import the heavier subpaths.

## Dependency policy

The package is one physical package,
 but its modules stay tiered by coupling.
Platform peers are optional so pure consumers do not need to declare them merely to consume string helpers.

Runtime dependencies:

- `zeptomatch: catalog:`,
   used by scope glob resolution.
- `type-fest: catalog:`,
   used for readonly helper types where needed.
- `valibot: catalog:`,
   used at runtime by settings validation.

Peer dependencies:

- `@earendil-works/pi-ai: *`,
   optional.
- `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent: *`,
   optional.

Peer dependency metadata:

- Mark both platform peers optional.
- Keep imports from optional peers out of the root and `./core` entry points.

Development dependencies:

- `@earendil-works/pi-ai: ^0.74.0`.
- `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent: catalog:`.
- `@monochromatic-dev/config-tsdown: workspace:*`.
- `@monochromatic-dev/config-typescript: workspace:*`.
- `@monochromatic-dev/module-test: workspace:*`.
- `@types/bun: catalog:`.

Consumer dependencies:

- Add `@monochromatic-dev/pi-shared-model-selection: workspace:*` to advisor,
   auto-mode,
  and thinking-defaults before changing imports.
- Do not add `@earendil-works/pi-ai` or `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` to thinking-defaults unless
  thinking-defaults starts importing coupled subpaths.

## Type strategy

Use structural model types and generic return types rather than forcing all consumers through one widened
`ReadonlyModel` type.

- `ModelIdentity`:
   `provider`,
   `id`,
   and `name`.
- `ModelPricing`:
   model identity plus `cost`,
   `contextWindow`,
   and `maxTokens`.
- `ReadonlyModel`:
   full pi-like readonly model shape for callers that need a complete model record.
- `ScopedModel<TModel extends ModelIdentity = ReadonlyModel>`:
   selected model entry retaining the caller's
  original model type.
- `EffectiveModelScope<TModel extends ModelIdentity = ReadonlyModel>`:
   scope entries retaining the caller's
  original model type.

Functions should be generic over the minimum shape they need.
For example,
 `canonicalSlug` needs only `provider` and `id`,
 while cost ranking needs pricing fields.
If a module must widen a `Model<Api>` to `ReadonlyModel`,
 expose a named conversion helper so the loss of
narrowed `api` typing is explicit at the call site.

## Absence convention

Shared APIs use `ABSENT` and `Maybe<T>` for expected misses.
This avoids `T | undefined` unions while keeping no-match flows non-exceptional.

Use `Maybe<T>` for:

- exact match helpers.
- pattern parse helpers when no model matches.
- budget auth callbacks when a candidate lacks usable credentials.
- registry lookup adapters that may not find a model.

Use thrown errors for invalid inputs,
 impossible internal states,
 and user-facing selection failures.
Use optional object fields for optional metadata,
 such as a thinking-level suffix or source path.

## Shared modules

### Core modules

- `maybe.ts`:
   move `ABSENT` and `Maybe<T>` from advisor.
- `types.ts`:
   define structural model,
   scope,
   cost,
   budget,
   and selection types.
- `model-id.ts`:
   provide `canonicalSlug`,
   `parseProviderModelSlug`,
   `getModelIdLeaf`,
   and allowed-slug helpers.
- `exact-match.ts`:
   move exact model reference matching with structural type parameters.
- `pattern-match.ts`:
   move model pattern parsing,
   thinking suffix parsing,
   glob detection,
   alias detection,
  date-suffix detection,
   and scoped model construction.
- `version.ts`:
   move version extraction,
   version-vector comparison,
   and major-version filtering.

Core extraction must also fix existing linear recursion in `scope-match.ts`.
`parseModelPattern` and `isAsciiDigitString` should use iterative scans rather than recursion over strings.

Promote these currently private helpers to public exports because consumers and tests need them after extraction:

- `isThinkingLevel`.
- `isAlias`.
- `hasDateSuffix`.

### Scope modules

- `argv-scope.ts`:
   move `parseArgvModelPatterns`.
- `settings-scope.ts`:
   move settings scope loading and replace `AdvisorSettingsFileSchema` with
  `PiSettingsFileSchema`,
   validating only `enabledModels`.
- `scope-patterns.ts`:
   move glob and literal scope resolution.
- `scope-resolver.ts`:
   move effective-scope resolution,
   but expose a narrow context interface instead of
  requiring `ExtensionContext` in the public signature.

The narrow scope context should include only:

- current working directory.
- available-model provider.
- optional live scope getter or live scope property.
- optional argv and home overrides for tests.

Before replacing `pi-ai`'s `modelsAreEqual` with canonical-slug deduplication,
 read the pi-ai source and verify
that provider/id canonical equality preserves behavior.
If not verified,
 keep `modelsAreEqual` isolated behind the optional `./pi-ai` path.

### Cost modules

- `cost-ranking.ts`:
   move advisor expected-cost scoring and default highest-cost selection.
- Export `scoreModel`,
   `compareCostScores`,
   and `buildCostRanking` as newly factored public helpers.
  Mark them as new decompositions,
   not direct moves.
- Keep advisor-specific `AdvisorModelSelection` in advisor.
- Keep advisor-specific reason text either in advisor or as an injectable reason formatter.

Token estimation should not force every consumer to import pi-coding-agent.
Either keep token estimation in advisor or place the direct `estimateTokens` wrapper in the optional
`./pi-coding-agent` subpath.

### Budget modules

Move budget selection strategy into shared while keeping host-specific auth in auto-mode.

- `budget-selection.ts`:
   same-provider and any-provider strategies,
   major-version filtering,
   candidate ordering,
   and sequential auth walk.
- `budget-override.ts`:
   override parsing and selection through injected model lookup and auth callbacks.
- `budget-report.ts`:
   candidate reporting and `NoBudgetModelError` if the error message can stay generic.
  If the fix text remains auto-mode-specific,
   keep only the formatter in auto-mode.

Budget selection must accept callbacks instead of importing auto-mode context directly:

```typescript
// packages/pi-shared/model-selection/src/budget-selection.ts
export type ResolveBudgetAuth<TModel> = (
  options: { readonly model: TModel; },
) => Promise<Maybe<BudgetModelAuth>>;

export type BudgetModelSelectionOptions<TModel extends ModelPricing> = {
  readonly activeModel: TModel;
  readonly allModels: readonly TModel[];
  readonly strategy: 'same-provider' | 'any-provider';
  readonly majorVersions: number;
  readonly resolveAuth: ResolveBudgetAuth<TModel>;
  readonly hasConfiguredAuth: (options: { readonly model: TModel; }) => boolean;
};
```

Auto-mode keeps the adapter that calls `ctx.modelRegistry.getApiKeyAndHeaders`,
 translates failures to `ABSENT`,
and passes registry-backed callbacks into shared budget selection.

## Consumer responsibilities after migration

### Advisor retains

- `advisor-selection.ts` as a thin wrapper that returns `AdvisorModelSelection`.
- `tool-context-selection.ts`,
   because it pairs model selection with advisor context budgeting.
- `advisor-client.ts`,
   API calls,
   and provider request handling.
- `context.ts` and `context-user.ts`,
   context serialization.
- `config.ts` and advisor-specific fields in `config-schemas.ts`.
- `rendering.ts` and `rendering-summary.ts`.
- `commands.ts`,
   `tool.ts`,
   and `tool-params.ts`.
- Advisor-specific types:
   `AdvisorConfig`,
   `AdvisorModelSelection`,
   `AdvisorDetails`,
   `AdvisorContext`,
  and tool result types.

### Auto-mode retains

- Registry auth adapter around `ModelRegistry.getApiKeyAndHeaders`.
- Extension config loading and defaults.
- Judge,
   signals,
   command parsing,
   trust handling,
   and non-model-selection code.
- Thin wrapper that passes active model,
   registry model list,
   strategy options,
   and auth callbacks to shared
  budget selection.

### Thinking-defaults retains

- Policy constants:
   GPT-shaped models use `xhigh`,
   other models use `high`.
- GPT detection if it remains policy-specific.
- Extension hook code in `apply-thinking-default.ts`.

Thinking-defaults imports `getModelIdLeaf` from the dependency-free core surface only.

## Test strategy

Move or rewrite tests by behavior,
 not by file name.
Each shared module gets tests that describe the public API after extraction.
Consumer tests remain for consumer-specific wrappers.

Move and generalize from advisor:

- argv parsing tests into `argv-scope.unit.test.ts`.
- canonical,
   bare-id,
   display-name,
   ambiguous,
   out-of-scope,
   and unknown slug tests into `model-id.unit.test.ts`.
- exact matching tests into `exact-match.unit.test.ts`.
- pattern,
   thinking suffix,
   alias,
   dated-version,
   fuzzy,
   and glob tests into `pattern-match.unit.test.ts`
  and `scope-patterns.unit.test.ts`.
- settings precedence and invalid settings tests into `settings-scope.unit.test.ts`.
- live,
   argv,
   settings,
   and available fallback tests into `scope-resolver.unit.test.ts`.
- expected-cost and tie-break tests into `cost-ranking.unit.test.ts`.

Move and generalize from auto-mode:

- version extraction,
   date skipping,
   version-vector sorting,
   and major-version filtering tests into
  `version.unit.test.ts`.
- same-provider strategy,
   any-provider strategy,
   auth failure,
   override selection,
  and candidate-report tests into `budget-selection.unit.test.ts` and `budget-override.unit.test.ts`.

Keep or add consumer tests:

- Advisor keeps tests for `AdvisorModelSelection` shape,
   advisor context budgeting,
   tool details,
  rendering,
   and extension status.
- Auto-mode keeps tests for registry auth adapter behavior,
   config defaults,
   judge behavior,
   and signal handling.
- Thinking-defaults keeps policy tests for GPT versus non-GPT thinking defaults.

Add characterization tests before rewiring imports:

- Advisor default model selection returns the same slug and ranking for fixed model fixtures.
- Advisor explicit slug resolution returns the same errors for ambiguous,
   out-of-scope,
   and unknown slugs.
- Auto-mode budget selection returns the same model for same-provider and any-provider fixtures.
- Auto-mode emits the same user-facing error message shape for no-auth cases.
- Thinking-defaults returns the same level for slash-prefixed and bare GPT ids.

## Risks and mitigations

- New top-level category:
   `pi-shared` differs from the nested `hook-types` precedent.
  Mitigation:
   document the category rule in the package README and keep actual extensions in `packages/pi-plugin/`.
- Single package with optional platform peers:
   broad root exports could make lightweight consumers pay for
  pi-ai or pi-coding-agent.
  Mitigation:
   root and `./core` stay dependency-free;
   coupled modules require explicit subpath imports;
  platform peers are optional.
- Full budget extraction:
   auto-mode selection is strategy,
   ratio gating,
   and auth sequencing,
  not an inverse advisor cost sort.
  Mitigation:
   shared budget selection accepts injected auth and registry callbacks;
   auto-mode keeps host adapters
  and characterization tests.
- `ReadonlyModel` widening:
   widening `Model<Api>['api']` to `string` can erase useful type information.
  Mitigation:
   use generic structural model types and return the caller's original model type.
- Settings validation:
   `valibot` is runtime code,
   not test-only code.
  Mitigation:
   keep `valibot` in `dependencies`.
- `modelsAreEqual` coupling:
   scope dedup may require pi-ai at runtime.
  Mitigation:
   verify pi-ai equality semantics before replacing it;
   otherwise isolate it behind an optional subpath.
- Promoted helpers:
   `isThinkingLevel`,
   `isAlias`,
   and `hasDateSuffix` move from private helpers to public API.
  Mitigation:
   document them as low-level helpers and cover them with direct tests.
- Existing recursion over strings:
   direct-moving `scope-match.ts` would preserve a stack-risk pattern.
  Mitigation:
   rewrite recursive flat-string scans to iterative scans during extraction.
- Regex in version extraction:
   current version helpers use guarded regexes.
  Mitigation:
   carry scoped disable comments and tests,
   or replace with iterative token scanning if the move touches
  those parsers substantially.
