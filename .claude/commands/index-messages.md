# Index Claude Conversations to Meilisearch

Please index Claude Code conversation data to Meilisearch by running:

```bash
moon run indexClaude
```

This will:
1. Index user messages from ~/.claude.json to the `claudeCodeUserMessages` index
2. Index MCP server logs from ~/.cache/claude-cli-nodejs to the `claudeCodeMcpServerLogs` index

After indexing, search for relevant content about: $ARGUMENTS

For any search results from claudeCodeMcpServerLogs:
1. First perform the search to find matching documents
2. The search results will show hoisted fields instead of a single content field
3. Key improvements in the indexing:
   - JSON log arrays are properly parsed into individual entries
   - All fields are hoisted to the top level
   - Tool call responses have `debug` field plus all response fields spread at top level
   - Plain text logs are stored in the `plainText` field
   - Duplicate fields removed (cwd was duplicate of projectPath)
   - Common filterable fields include: logId, server, projectPath, timestamp, debug, content, isError, etc.
   - Nested JSON is parsed level-by-level up to 16 levels deep
   - Escaped quotes are removed for clean JSON output
   - Tool call results with prefixes like "Documents:" or "Search results:" are properly parsed
   - Original log files are deleted after successful indexing for security

Note: Extremely deeply nested JSON (beyond 16 levels) may still contain escaped quotes due to depth limits.

This helps maintain context awareness by making conversation history and tool interactions searchable.
