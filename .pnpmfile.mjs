/**
 * Global dependency blocklist hook for substitution policies.
 *
 * This file owns the mechanism: a pnpm `readPackage` hook that rewrites every
 * dependency entry pointing at a blocked package to a workspace stub. The policy
 * table itself (the data) lives in `.pnpmfile.policies.json`, imported below, so
 * the blocklist churns independently of this hook logic.
 *
 * Companion to the `overrides` block in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, which owns the
 * removal cases (`"banned-pkg": "-"`). This hook owns the cases where a stub
 * should land in `node_modules` so consumers can still resolve the import.
 *
 * Re-resolution caveat: pnpm's `pnpmfileChecksum` hashes this file's bytes only,
 * not the imported `.pnpmfile.policies.json`. After editing the policy data,
 * change this file's bytes so pnpm re-runs resolution; a data-only edit alone
 * leaves the checksum unchanged and the old graph cached. `pnpm install --force`
 * alone may not re-trigger the hook while the checksum is unchanged (observed on
 * pnpm 11.6.0), so editing this file is the reliable trigger.
 *
 * See `docs/dependency-blocklist.md` for the policy reference, the decision
 * rule between throw / silent / remove, and worked examples.

/**
 * @typedef {object} Policy
 * @property {'throw' | 'silent'} action
 *   `throw`: substitute with @monochromatic-dev/stub-throwing. Loading the
 *   module throws an error naming the policy file. Use when at least one
 *   importer hard-imports the package (no `try/catch` guard) and you want a
 *   loud, informative failure at the import site.
 *
 *   `silent`: substitute with @monochromatic-dev/stub-silent. Property reads,
 *   function calls, and `new` invocations return the stub itself. `in` checks
 *   return `false`. Use for soft migrations where build-green matters more
 *   than runtime correctness.
 *
 *   Removal is not an action here. Add `"name": "-"` to the `overrides` block
 *   in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` instead, since pnpm has a native primitive.
 * @property {string} reason
 *   One-line explanation surfaced in the install-time warning. Cite the
 *   replacement, the migration ticket, or the rationale.
 * @property {string[]} [allowed]
 *   Optional allowlist of consumer package names that should keep resolving
 *   to the real dependency. Useful for legacy packages mid-migration. For
 *   removal entries, use pnpm's parent-scoped `"consumer>banned": "<version>"`
 *   form in `overrides` instead.
