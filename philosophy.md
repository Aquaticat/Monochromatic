## MAYBE: Target Firefox ESR 128?

Which comes out on July 9 according to [Firefox Release Calendar](https://whattrainisitnow.com/calendar/).

Which means we'll not have to work around these features lacking in Firefox ESR 115:

1.  `content-visibility`

2.  `:has()`

3.  CSS Nesting

    No need to downlevel it.

4.  Text Fragment
