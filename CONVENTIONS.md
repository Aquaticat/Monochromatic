## Markdown

- Ensure each sentence or long phrase is on its own line.
- Bullet lists use the `-` marker.
  - There should be one space after the marker.
- For numbered lists, pad the `1.` marker with enough space after it so it's always 4 characters long.
  - For example:
    1.  This is the first item.
    2.  This is the second item.
