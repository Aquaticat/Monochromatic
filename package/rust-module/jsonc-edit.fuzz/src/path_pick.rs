//! What:     Fuzzer-driven address selection over a parsed document.
//! Why:      Edit targets must address members that actually exist;
//!           generating paths blind would spend the whole budget on not-found errors.

/// What:     Import the unstructured-input API.
/// Why:      Each descent decision and child index comes from the fuzzer's byte budget.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// import { Unstructured } from 'arbitrary';
/// ```
use arbitrary::{Result as ArbitraryResult, Unstructured};

/// What:     Import the address model and the text conversion used to name keys.
/// Why:      A path segment names a member either by key text or by element position.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// import { JsoncPathSegment, JsoncValue, unitsToString } from 'monochromatic-jsonc-edit';
/// ```
use monochromatic_jsonc_edit::{units_to_string, JsoncKind, JsoncPathSegment, JsoncValue};

/// What:     Cap on generated address length.
/// Why:      Generated documents nest at most a few containers,
///           so a larger cap would only produce repeated not-found paths.
const MAX_SEGMENTS: usize = 6;

/// What:     Choose one address that resolves inside the given document.
/// Why:      Edits are only meaningful where a member exists,
///           and the fuzzer should still decide how deep to go and which child to take.
///           The walk stops at a key whose text cannot be represented as Rust `String`,
///           which happens for an escaped unpaired surrogate:
///           such a member is unreachable through the string-keyed address API.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `root` - Parsed document to address into.
/// * `u` - Fuzzer input supplying every choice.

/// ```ts
/// export function randomPath(root: JsoncValue, u: Unstructured): JsoncPathSegment[];
/// ```
