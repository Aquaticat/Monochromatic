//! What:     Unit tests for fuzzer-driven address selection.
//! Why:      The edit target only exercises edits if the addresses it draws actually resolve. A
//!           picker that returned mostly missing addresses would turn that campaign into a
//!           not-found test and hide the interesting failures.

/// What:     Import the unstructured-input type.
/// Why:      Tests drive selection from explicit byte buffers.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// import { Unstructured } from 'arbitrary';
/// ```

/// What:     Import the picker under test.
/// Why:      Its guarantees are resolution, bounded length and coverage of both segment kinds.

/// ```ts
/// import { randomPath } from './pathPick';
/// ```

/// import { jsoncHas, parseJsonc, JsoncPathSegment } from 'monochromatic-jsonc-edit';
