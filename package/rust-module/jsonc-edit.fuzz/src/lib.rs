//! What:     Shared support for the `monochromatic-jsonc-edit` fuzz sidecar.
//! Why:      Every target needs the same structured generator and the same invariant checks, so they
//!           live here once instead of being copied into each harness.
//!
//! Raw bytes almost never form valid JSONC, so the generator builds documents from unstructured
//! input and the targets assert properties over the result rather than hoping for lucky parses.

/// What:     Structured document and path generators built on `arbitrary`.
/// Why:      Coverage comes from valid and near-valid JSONC shapes, not from random noise.
