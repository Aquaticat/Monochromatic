//! What:     Unit tests for the shared invariant checks.
//! Why:      An invariant that cannot fail is not an invariant. Each check here is proven in both
//!           directions: a positive control where it must hold, and a deliberately broken input
//!           where it must panic, so a fuzz campaign that reports nothing is evidence rather than
//!           silence.

/// What:     Import the panic-capture helpers.
/// Why:      The negative controls assert that a check panics, and the default hook would print a
///           backtrace for every one of them.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// import { catchUnwind, setHook, takeHook } from 'std:panic';
/// ```

/// What:     Import the checks under test.
/// Why:      Every exported invariant needs a passing and a failing case.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// import { assertCanonicalStability, ... } from './invariants';

/// Why:      Negative controls need trees that the parser would never produce, which means building
