//! What:     Unit tests for the structured generators.
//! Why:      A fuzz campaign is only as trustworthy as its generator: if the generator emits
//!           documents the contract rejects, every campaign measures the wrong thing. These tests
//!           pin the generator's guarantees, including that its own depth bookkeeping agrees with the
//!           independent measurement in `invariants`.

/// What:     Import the `Arbitrary` trait and the unstructured-input type.
/// Why:      Tests drive generators from explicit byte buffers instead of a fuzzer, and the trait
///           supplies the constructor.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// import { Arbitrary, Unstructured } from 'arbitrary';
/// ```
use arbitrary::{Arbitrary, Unstructured};

/// What:     Import the generators under test.
/// Why:      Each has a guarantee the campaigns depend on.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// import { mutated, nestedDocument, replacementValue, GeneratedDocument } from './generators';
/// ```

/// What:     Import the independent depth measurement.
/// Why:      The generator's own counter is only trustworthy if it agrees with a second
///           implementation.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// import { depthOf } from './invariants';
/// ```

/// What:     Import the crate's parse entry point and payload enum.
/// Why:      Parseability is the generator's central promise, and kind coverage is asserted by name.
