//! What:     Rejection target: one deliberate mutation away from valid input must never panic.
//! Why:      Real callers hand this crate truncated files, stray commas and broken escapes. The
//!           contract is a returned `JsoncParseError`, not an abort, an overflow or an infinite loop,
//!           and mutated valid documents reach those paths far more often than random bytes do.
