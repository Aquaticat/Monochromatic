//! What:     Edit target: every edit must be immutable, addressable and canonical afterwards.
//! Why:      The crate promises that edits return new documents and leave the previous one usable,
//!           that comments stay owned by the address they were attached to, and that emission stays
//!           a fixed point after any edit. Those promises are exactly what a fuzzer should attack
//!           with random addresses and random replacement values.
