//! What:     Round-trip target: every generated document must parse, emit canonically and stay stable.
//! Why:      This is the crate's core promise, so it is the first property fuzzing should attack:
//!           canonical output must be a fixed point, comments must survive it, and the parsed tree
//!           must respect the published nesting bound.
