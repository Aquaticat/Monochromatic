//! What:     The address type used to reach one key or element inside a parsed JSONC document.
//!           A path is a slice of segments (`&[JsoncPathSegment]`, a borrowed read-only view of a
//!           sequence, not an owned `Vec` or a fixed array), and each segment is either an object
//!           key or an array index.
//! Why:      The read and edit API must address members without inventing a string syntax, so a
//!           caller states exactly which key or index it means and cannot be confused by a key
//!           that looks like a number.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // module path: type JsoncPathSegment = { kind: 'key'; key: string } | { kind: 'index'; index: number };
