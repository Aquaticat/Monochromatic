//! What:     Address resolution inside a parsed JSONC document.
//!           A path is a slice of segments, and resolution walks one segment at a time through record
//!           members and array elements, reporting a missing address and a wrong-shaped target
//!           separately.
//! Why:      Reads, edits and comment queries all need the same walk, and duplicate object keys must
//!           resolve the same way the maintained TypeScript package resolves them: the last member with
//!           that key wins.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // module navigate: lookup(state, path), keys(state, path), has(state, path).
//! ```

/// What:     Import the edit failure enum and its two underlying causes.
/// Why:      Resolution distinguishes "nothing at this address" from "this target has the wrong shape".
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// import { JsoncEditError, JsoncPathNotFoundError, JsoncTypeError } from './error';
/// ```
use crate::error::{JsoncEditError, JsoncPathNotFoundError, JsoncTypeError};
/// What:     Import the address segment type.
/// Why:      A segment states whether the caller means an object key or an array index.

/// ```ts
/// import type { JsoncPathSegment } from './path';
/// ```

/// What:     Encode ordinary Rust text as UTF-16 code units.
/// Why:      Stored keys are code units, so a requested key must be compared in the same form to match
///           a key written with escapes or holding a lone surrogate.
///

/// function keyUnits(key: string): number[] { return [...key].map((ch) => ch.charCodeAt(0)); }

/// What:     Find the last member whose decoded key equals the requested text.

///           one, so this crate resolves identically instead of picking an arbitrary match.
