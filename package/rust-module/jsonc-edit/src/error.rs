//! What:     The crate's public failure types: a byte-offset parse failure, a number-token failure,
//!           a missing document address, and a wrong-shape address or target.
//! Why:      Each failure answers a different caller question (where is the malformed byte, which
//!           literal is not a JSON number, which address does not exist, which target has the wrong
//!           shape), so collapsing them into one string would force callers to parse messages.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // module error: class JsoncParseError extends Error; class JsoncPathNotFoundError extends Error;
//! ```

/// What:     Import the address type so a not-found failure can carry the address it was given.
/// Why:      A caller debugging a failed edit needs the exact path back, not only a message.
