//! ```

/// What: Import the comment value and its discriminated source kind.
/// Why: This module combines and emits only those parser-owned values.

/// import type { JsoncComment, JsoncCommentKind } from './value';
/// ```

/// ```

    //      in trailing form: the comment would end early and the rest of the body would be parsed
    //      as code. Fuzzing found exactly that as an emission the parser then rejected.

    // What: Prefer the block form for a block comment, or for any body carrying a bare CR.

    //      body with only LF keeps the established one `//` line per body line layout.

    //      cannot be emitted as a block. Splitting on CR too is lossy for that character but never
    //      corrupts the document, which an emitted `//` line containing CR would.
    // What: Normalize CRLF to LF first, then split on either remaining terminator.
    // Why: `str::split` accepts an array of chars as a pattern but not an array of strings, and
    //      splitting a CRLF pair as two terminators would emit an empty comment line between them.
