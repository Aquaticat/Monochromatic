//! What:     The public structural edit surface: replacing or inserting a value at an address, and
//!           deleting a member or element.
//! Why:      Each operation returns a new document and leaves the input untouched, which is the immutable
//!           edit contract the maintained TypeScript package documents.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // module editApply: jsoncSet(root, path, value), jsoncDelete(root, path).
//! ```

/// What:     Import the iterative spine operations that perform the rebuild.
/// Why:      Descent and rebuild live in one place so reads, edits and comment edits cannot drift apart.

/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// import { deleteValue, setValue } from './editSpine';
/// ```

/// Why:      An edit can hit a missing address or a wrong-shaped target, and both are ordinary results.

/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// import type { JsoncEditError } from './error';
/// ```

/// What:     Import the address segment type.
/// Why:      A caller states each step as a key or an index rather than as a string path.

/// ```ts
/// import type { JsoncPathSegment } from './path';
/// ```

/// Why:      Setting is the common edit; it replaces an existing value, keeps that address's comment, and
///           appends only when the missing segment is the final one.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// function jsoncSet(state: JsoncEditState, path: JsoncPathSegment[], value: JsoncValue): JsoncEditState;
