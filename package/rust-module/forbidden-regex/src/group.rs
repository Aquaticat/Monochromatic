//! Greedy combination of literal-free rules into a few union DFAs.
//!
//! What: the seedless (literal-free) rules run against every line, so [`group_seedless`]
//! collapses them from N separate DFA passes into a few combined union DFAs. Why: one
//! O(1)-per-byte pass over a union covers many rules at once; growing a group rule by
//! rule lets the smart `alt` constructor share structure across members, so compatible
//! rules fold together while the per-group state cap keeps the explosive ones apart.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // module group: see exported functions and types below.
//! ```

/// What:    Imports the node algebra combined into each group.

/// What: a state ceiling on a group's union DFA; a trial union exceeding it starts a
