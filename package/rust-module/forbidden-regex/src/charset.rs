//! What:    A 256-bit set of bytes, the leaf alphabet of the engine.

//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // module charset: see exported functions and types below.

/// What:    Imports the serde derives so byte sets can be persisted inside a compiled program.
/// Why:     The code below uses `Deserialize`, `Serialize` directly; importing from `serde`
///          keeps each call site focused on the matcher logic instead of the full Rust path.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// import { Deserialize, Serialize } from "serde";
/// ```

/// What:    Number of `u64` words needed to hold one bit per possible byte value (256/64).
/// Why:     The program gives this fixed value a name so every caller uses the same setting.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
