//! What:    Smart constructors that keep nodes canonical so derivative states stay finite.
//! Why:     This file is the Rust module that groups the smart implementation, so the
//!          compiler gives those items one namespace and sibling modules can import that name.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // module smart: see exported functions and types below.
//! ```
