//! What:    A byte cursor over the pattern that skips verbose-mode whitespace and comments.
//! Why:     This file is the Rust module that groups the cursor implementation, so the
//!          compiler gives those items one namespace and sibling modules can import that name.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):

/// A forward cursor over the pattern bytes.

/// What: holds the source bytes and a current offset, and knows how to skip the
/// always-on verbose-mode noise (unescaped whitespace and first-column `#`
/// comments). Why: every grammar rule reads through this one cursor, so the
/// verbose-mode rules live in exactly one place.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// type Cursor = {
///   // fields documented in Rust above
