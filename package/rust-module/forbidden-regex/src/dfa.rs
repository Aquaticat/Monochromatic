//! What:    The compiled deterministic automaton: byte classes, builder, table, and runner.
//! Why:     This file is the Rust module that groups the dfa implementation, so the
//!          compiler gives those items one namespace and sibling modules can import that name.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // module dfa: see exported functions and types below.
//! ```

/// What:    Byte-class equivalence computation.
/// Why:     The package keeps that concept in a separate Rust file so this module can refer to
