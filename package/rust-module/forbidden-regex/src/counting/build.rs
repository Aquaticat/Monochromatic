//! Builds a counting NFA from a node tree by a Glushkov-style position walk.

//! What: [`build_nfa`] turns a concatenation/alternation of classes, class
//! repetitions, and anchors into positions plus follow sets; it returns `None` for
//! intersection, complement, or `Top`, which the product or eager DFA handle. Why:
//! computing first/last/follow per subexpression yields an epsilon-free position
//! automaton whose alternation is just extra edges, so `{n,m}` never unrolls.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // module build: see exported functions and types below.
//! ```
