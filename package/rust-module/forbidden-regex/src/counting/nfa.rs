//! What:    The serializable counting NFA: positions, follow sets, and start set.
//! Why:     This file is the Rust module that groups the nfa implementation, so the
//!          compiler gives those items one namespace and sibling modules can import that name.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // module nfa: see exported functions and types below.
//! ```

/// What:    Imports the serde derives so a counting NFA can be persisted.
/// Why:     The code below uses `Deserialize`, `Serialize` directly; importing from `serde`
///          keeps each call site focused on the matcher logic instead of the full Rust path.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// import { Deserialize, Serialize } from "serde";
/// ```

/// What:    Imports the position kind and its decode-time check.
/// Why:     The code below uses `Element`, `validate_element` directly; importing from
///          `crate/counting/element` keeps each call site focused on the matcher logic instead
///          of the full Rust path.
