//! What:    The element leaf type and its decode-time validation.
//! Why:     This file is the Rust module that groups the element implementation, so the
//!          compiler gives those items one namespace and sibling modules can import that name.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // module element: see exported functions and types below.

/// What:    Imports the serde derives so an element can be persisted.
/// Why:     The code below uses `Deserialize`, `Serialize` directly; importing from `serde`
///          keeps each call site focused on the matcher logic instead of the full Rust path.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// import { Deserialize, Serialize } from "serde";
/// ```

///          call site focused on the matcher logic instead of the full Rust path.

/// What: an upper limit on a `Counted` element's `max`, checked on decode. Why: the
/// counter-set can hold up to `max` distinct values, so a hostile serialized bound
/// could force unbounded memory; this caps it well above the parser's own limit.
