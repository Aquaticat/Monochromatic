//! What:    Counting-NFA search loop under unanchored matching.
//! Why:     This file is the Rust module that groups the run implementation, so the
//!          compiler gives those items one namespace and sibling modules can import that name.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // module run: see exported functions and types below.
//! ```

/// What:    Imports the counting NFA being run.
/// Why:     The code below uses `CountingNfa` directly; importing from `crate/counting/nfa`
///          keeps each call site focused on the matcher logic instead of the full Rust path.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// import { CountingNfa } from "crate/counting/nfa";
/// ```

/// Why:     The code below uses `State`, `boundary_ctx`, `closure`, `step_into` directly;
///          importing from `crate/counting/sim` keeps each call site focused on the matcher
///          logic instead of the full Rust path.

/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):

/// What: at each boundary seed the start positions afresh (the `Σ*` search prefix),
/// take the zero-width closure, test acceptance, then consume the next byte into the
/// spare buffer and swap. Why: a match may start at any position and end at any
/// boundary, so both seeding and the accept test happen at every boundary; the two
/// buffers are reused so the byte step never allocates.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
