//! A bounded set of live repetition counts stored as a bitset.
//!
//! What: [`CountSet`] holds the set of active counts of one `Counted` element as a
//! bit per count value (`bit i` set means count `i` is live), bounded by the
//! element's `max`. Why: a `Counted` element's counts only ever lie in `[0, max]`,
//! so a fixed-width bitset replaces a heap `BTreeSet`; entry is one bit-or, the
//! exit guard is one shift-and-test, and a matched byte advances every count at
//! once with a single multi-word left shift, with no per-byte allocation.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // module countset: see exported functions and types below.
//! ```
