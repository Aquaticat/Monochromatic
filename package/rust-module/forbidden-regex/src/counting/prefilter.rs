//! Required-literal seeds and the per-engine substring prefilter.
//!
//! What: [`seeds_from_node`] derives literal seeds such that every match of a node
//! contains one as a substring, and [`Prefilter`] turns seeds into SIMD searchers.
//! Why:     This file is the Rust module that groups the prefilter implementation, so the
//!          compiler gives those items one namespace and sibling modules can import that name.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // module prefilter: see exported functions and types below.
//! ```

/// What:    Imports the SIMD substring searcher used to test each seed.
/// Why:     The code below uses `Finder` directly; importing from `memchr/memmem` keeps each
///          call site focused on the matcher logic instead of the full Rust path.
///
