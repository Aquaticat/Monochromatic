//! What:    Position-dependent nullability: does a node match the empty string here?
//! Why:     This file is the Rust module that groups the nullable implementation, so the
//!          compiler gives those items one namespace and sibling modules can import that name.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // module nullable: see exported functions and types below.
//! ```

/// What:    Imports the node algebra being tested.
/// Why:     The code below uses `Node` directly; importing from `crate/ast/node` keeps each call
///          site focused on the matcher logic instead of the full Rust path.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// import { Node } from "crate/ast/node";
/// ```
use crate::ast::node::Node;

/// What:    Imports the boundary context that resolves anchors.
/// Why:     The code below uses `Ctx` directly; importing from `crate/context` keeps each call
///          site focused on the matcher logic instead of the full Rust path.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// import { Ctx } from "crate/context";
/// ```
use crate::context::Ctx;

/// Reports whether `node` accepts the empty string at the given boundary.
///
/// What: the standard Brzozowski nullability function, extended so the anchors
/// read `ctx`. `Empty`/`Top` are nullable; `Fail`/`Class` are not; `Concat` and
/// `Inter` need all children nullable; `Alt` needs one; `Comp` flips its child;
/// `Repeat` is nullable when zero copies are allowed or the body itself is
/// nullable; the anchors consult the context. Why: a string is accepted exactly
/// when the residual after consuming it is nullable, so this is the acceptance
/// test the matcher and DFA builder both rely on.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// function nullable(node: Node, ctx: Ctx): boolean {
///   // Rust body below is the implementation.
/// }
/// ```
pub fn nullable(node: &Node, ctx: Ctx) -> bool {
    // What: one arm per variant; structural recursion over the node tree (a
    // bounded walk, never over flat input). Why: nullability is defined by case.
    //
    // In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
    // ```ts
    // // Same step as the Rust statement below, written with ordinary TS objects/functions.
    // ```
