//! What:     This Rust crate exports [`compile`], [`Regex`], and [`RegexSet`].
//!           A Rust crate is closest to a TypeScript package module: it has private
//!           implementation files and a public API surface. The implementation matches
//!           byte slices (`&[u8]`, a borrowed read-only view of bytes, not an owned
//!           `Vec<u8>` or fixed `[u8; N]` array), and internally chooses counting,
//!           product, or derivative-DFA matcher back-ends plus set-level literal gating.
//! Why:     This file is the Rust module that groups the lib implementation, so the
//!          compiler gives those items one namespace and sibling modules can import that name.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // module lib: see exported functions and types below.
//! ```
//!
//! The batch match kernels (`dfa::sheng`/`dfa::sheng2`) use explicit `std::arch` SIMD
//! intrinsics (`vpermb` / `vqtbl4q`), runtime-detected, so the crate needs no nightly
//! `portable_simd` feature.
