//! What:    Counting back-end: a small structural matcher that keeps bounded-repetition counts
//!          in runtime counter-sets instead of unrolled DFA states. The eager DFA unrolls
//!          `{n,m}`, which explodes when a repeated class overlaps a literal prefix under
//!          unanchored search (an `AKIA[A-Z2-7]{16}` key is exactly that shape). This module
//!          keeps such a pattern as a [`CountingNfa`] of positions and matches it with a
//!          counting-set simulation whose serialized size is linear in the pattern, never in
//!          the repetition bound; alternation costs only follow edges, and intersection with
//!          complement runs as a synchronized [`ProductProgram`].
//! Why:     This file is the Rust module that groups the counting implementation, so the
//!          compiler gives those items one namespace and sibling modules can import that name.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
