//! What:    Compile-time error type for the forbidden-regex engine.
//! Why:     This file is the Rust module that groups the error implementation, so the
//!          compiler gives those items one namespace and sibling modules can import that name.

/// What:    Imports the formatter pieces used to render a human-readable error message.
/// Why:     The code below uses `fmt` directly; importing from `std` keeps each call site
///          focused on the matcher logic instead of the full Rust path.
