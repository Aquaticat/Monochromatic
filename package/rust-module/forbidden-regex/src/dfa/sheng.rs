//! Sheng-style in-register transition kernel: a faster single-line DFA scan.
//!
//! What: for a DFA of at most 64 states, fold each input byte's whole transition column
//! into one 64-byte permute table, so the per-byte step is a register permute (`vpermb`
//! on AVX-512VBMI, `vqtbl4q` on NEON) instead of a dependent table load. Why: a per-line
//! scan's critical chain is the dependent transition load (~5 cycles); a permute shortens
//! it, and needs no length sorting (a different axis from the across-lines batch). The
//! whole DFA state stays in a vector: every lane starts at the same state and every step
//! applies the same permute, so all lanes stay equal and lane 0 is the state.
//! Position-dependent acceptance folds in branchlessly: each byte accumulates
//! `acc |= accept_mask[state] & ctx_bit[byte]` in-register, tested once at the end. The
//! permute is the explicit intrinsic, not portable SIMD's `swizzle_dyn`, which scalarizes
//! a 64-byte dynamic shuffle instead of emitting `vpermb`.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // module sheng: see exported functions and types below.
//! ```
