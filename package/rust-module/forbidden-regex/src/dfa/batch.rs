//! Batched multi-line match kernels for one DFA: a scalar reference, an interleaved-scalar
//! kernel, and a branchless equal-length kernel.
//!
//! What: a per-line scalar baseline, an interleaved kernel advancing `N` lines in lockstep
//! with independent scalar transition reads, and a branchless kernel for exact-length
//! buckets. Why: a consumer scanning a whole file calls one DFA against many lines;
//! advancing several at once exposes the memory-level parallelism the per-line loop's
//! serial state dependency hides. The faster across-lines win is the Sheng permute kernel
//! (see `dfa::sheng`/`dfa::sheng2`); the interleaved and tight kernels here reach parity to
//! a small win and back the `is_match_batch_bucketed` opt-in for over-64-state DFAs. A
//! vertical SIMD gather across lines was measured and removed: it lost on both arches
//! (x86 has no 16-bit gather, even native u32 `vpgatherdd` and NEON lose to scalar loads).
