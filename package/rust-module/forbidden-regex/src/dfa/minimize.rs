//! What:    DFA state minimization by Moore partition refinement.
//! Why:     This file is the Rust module that groups the minimize implementation, so the
//!          compiler gives those items one namespace and sibling modules can import that name.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // module minimize: see exported functions and types below.
//! ```

/// What:    Imports the hash map used to assign colors from signatures.
/// Why:     The code below uses `HashMap` directly; importing from `std/collections` keeps each
///          call site focused on the matcher logic instead of the full Rust path.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// import { HashMap } from "std/collections";
/// ```
use std::collections::HashMap;

/// What:    Imports the table type being minimized.
/// Why:     The code below uses `Dfa` directly; importing from `crate/dfa/table` keeps each call
///          site focused on the matcher logic instead of the full Rust path.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// import { Dfa } from "crate/dfa/table";

///
/// What: Moore's algorithm: color states by acceptance mask, then repeatedly
/// refine so two states share a color only if every class transition leads to the
/// same color, until the partition is stable; rebuild one state per color. Why:
/// the unanchored derivative construction over-distinguishes overlapping partial
/// matches, so the raw DFA has far more states than the language needs; the
/// minimal DFA is smaller, faster (better cache behavior), and smaller to
/// serialize.
