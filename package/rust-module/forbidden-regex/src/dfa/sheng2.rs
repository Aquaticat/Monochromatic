//! Two-byte composed Sheng kernel: one permute advances the state by two input bytes.
//!
//! What: for a DFA whose acceptance is position-independent (every state's mask is all-set
//! or all-clear, so no `$`/`\b` makes it depend on the next byte) and with few byte
//! classes, precompute a transition table over class PAIRS: `t2[c0,c1][s]` = the state two
//! bytes on. The per-(two-byte) step is then one `vpermb`, halving the critical chain
//! versus the one-byte Sheng. Why: the one-byte kernel is latency-bound on the transition
//! permute; composing two steps into one table halves that chain. Acceptance over the pair
//! is folded into a second table `a2[c0,c1][s]` (did the state or the in-between state
//! accept), kept off the critical chain. Position-independence lets acceptance be a single
//! bit, so the pair table stays one byte per entry.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // module sheng2: see exported functions and types below.
//! ```
