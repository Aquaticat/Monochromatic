//! What: Compose declaration, generic-instantiation and inference-hole checks.
//! Why: Syntax alone cannot distinguish a generic call from a nongeneric method with the same name.

//! // Check all annotation surfaces against the same registered semantic parse.

/// Import owned findings and selected rule severity.

/// What: Enforce the complete policy inside an attached semantic database scope.
/// Why: The context must come from that scope's registered syntax root, not a separate parse.
/// Processing-failure findings remain distinct from ordinary violations; no type or capture fixes are guessed.
