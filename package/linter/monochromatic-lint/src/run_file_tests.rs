//! What: Controls for the per-file pipeline: read, check or fix, refuse, write.
//! Why: What lands on disk and what is reported must agree in every outcome, including refusals.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! describe(processFile.name, () => { /* lint, fix and write, unchanged, refused, unreadable */ });
//! ```

/// Import the pipeline and fixture helpers.
