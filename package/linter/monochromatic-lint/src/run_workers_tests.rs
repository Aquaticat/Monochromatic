//! What: Controls for bounded workers, result ordering and panic containment.
//! Why: Output must not depend on scheduling, every plan must be processed exactly once at every
//! concurrency limit, and a panic must become that file's finding.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! describe(processPlans.name, () => { /* order, limits, exactly-once writes, containment */ });
//! ```
