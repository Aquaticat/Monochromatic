//! What: Controls for writing output to a stream that may close early or fail, and for the panic hook.
//! Why: A closed pipe is an ordinary end of output; any other write failure must change the exit status.
//! The panic hook is process-wide, so its control runs one invocation in a child process.
//! Argument parsing and real streams are exercised by the binary-level container tests.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! describe('emit', () => { /* bytes written, closed pipe tolerated, other failures reported */ });
//! ```
