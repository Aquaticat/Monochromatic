//! What:
//!  Decide,
//!  before any rule runs,
//!  what each input file is and which configuration governs it.
//! Why:
//!  Configuration and setup errors must stop the run with status 2 before a single file is
//! read for linting or rewritten,
//!  and worker threads then need only immutable plans.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // planFile(store, path) -> { absolute, display, relative, language, config, root } | skipped
//! ```
