//! Why: One file has three names: its absolute location (for reads and writes), its display name
//! (for findings), and its configuration-relative logical path (for `files` and `ignores` patterns).
//! Keeping the derivations together stops the three from drifting apart.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):

//! // absoluteNormal(path, cwd); displayName(absolute, cwd); relativeFrom(base, absolute); languageOf(path)
