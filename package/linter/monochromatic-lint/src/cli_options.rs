//!  The accepted native unified-linter command grammar.
//! Why:
//!  Flags,
//!  help and usage validation share the incumbent's CLI parser instead of divergent manual scanning.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // Declare typed command options; execution consumes native paths without lossy string conversion.
//! ```

///  Parsed command options,
