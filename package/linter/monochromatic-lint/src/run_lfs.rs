//! What: Per-run sharing of LFS repository facts across files and worker threads.
//! Why: Every Markdown file under one `.lfsconfig` uses the same endpoint, tracked patterns and
//! resolved image targets; discovering them once per repository keeps a large run from re-reading
//! the same configuration and re-hashing the same images.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // repos.contextFor(filePath, document, setting) -> LfsImageContext | undefined
//! ```
