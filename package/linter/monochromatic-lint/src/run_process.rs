//!  The process boundary:

//!  Everything above this module is testable with injected values;
//!  this module only connects
//! them to the operating system and makes sure no failure leaves the process without the
//! program's own explanation and one of the documented statuses.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):

//! // process.exitCode = runProcess();
//! ```

///  The default hook writes a message to standard error for every panic,
