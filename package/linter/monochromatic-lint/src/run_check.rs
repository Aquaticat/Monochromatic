//! What:
//!  Check one exact snapshot of a host file:
//!  its own rules,
//!  then every embedded virtual file.
//! Why:
//!  Processors are always on.
//!  Each virtual file is matched against configuration by its own
//! logical path,
//!  and every finding and fix is mapped back to the host before it leaves this module,
//! so the fix loop and the output only ever see host coordinates.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // class HostChecker implements SourceChecker { check(source) { return [...root(source), ...virtualFiles(source)]; } }
//! ```

/// Import the configuration outcome for virtual paths and the finding and fix models.
/// Import Markdown parsing,
///  typed selection and dispatch.
/// Import the processor seam;
///  virtual findings arrive or are projected in host coordinates.
/// Import Rust syntax dispatch,
///  the semantic engine and typed selection.
