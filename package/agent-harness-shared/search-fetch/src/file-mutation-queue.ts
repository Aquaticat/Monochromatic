/**
 Serialize file mutations that target one path while leaving different paths concurrent.

 Ported from Pi's `withFileMutationQueue` so output formatting needs no pi dependency.
 One documented deviation: the queue key is `path.resolve` output rather than a `realpath`
 canonicalization, so two symlink spellings of one file queue separately while mutation
 registration stays strictly call-ordered.
