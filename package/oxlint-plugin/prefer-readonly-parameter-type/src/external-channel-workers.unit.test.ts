/**
 * Whether the external channel survives oxlint's default worker count.
 *
 * The only test here that runs oxlint to reach the external channel, and it exists because no other shape
 * can fail when this breaks. Measured rather than argued: deleting the eager initializer from `index.ts`
 * kills this test and leaves `external-capture-channel.unit.test.ts` passing. That test drives the effect
 * summaries from plain `node`, where the second native child spawns without trouble, so every external
 * assertion in it holds whether or not the channel works under the linter that actually ships.
 *
 * ## What broke, and why it was invisible
 *
 * A native TypeScript child was created per generated implementation project, on demand, mid-lint. Under
 * oxlint that spawn fails:
 *
 * ```text
 * external effect inference failed for ... retainCallback: Error: spawn ENOMEM
 * ```
 *
 * `externalCallableEffect` catches it, logs at debug, and answers with the same sentinel it uses for a
 * package it cannot resolve. Every call then falls through to the unresolved boundary, which withholds, so
 * the entire channel disappeared without a single failing assertion anywhere. Four separate investigations
 * read that silence as evidence that no dependency's shipped implementation resolves.
 *
 * ## Why the worker count, and why not merely the ordering
 *
 * Measured at every thread count on a 16-core host with 63 GiB RAM and `/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory`
 * at 0, counting reports and how many carried external provenance:
 *
 * ```text
 * threads=1    4 / 4        threads=8    4 / 4
 * threads=2    4 / 4        threads=16   5 / 0
 * threads=4    4 / 4
 * ```
 *
 * Reservations exist at eight workers too and the spawn succeeds there, so "started after the
 * reservations" cannot be the criterion. What decides it is the aggregate reserved size at spawn time.
 *
 * That is why this test passes no `--threads` flag. Pinning a specific count would pin the wrong quantity,
 * and a count below this host's would pass while the shipped default failed.
 *
 * ## What it asserts, and what it deliberately does not
 *
 * External provenance in the output. Only `applyExternalEffect` and the capture channel beside it write a
 * package name and version into a message, so its presence proves the shipped implementation was loaded
 * and its summary applied.
 *
 * It does not assert the readonly offer that the falsification used, because that needs `type-fest`
 * resolvable from the consumer and this package does not depend on it. Measured without it: the reports
 * arrive and carry provenance, and only the suggestion changes. The offer belongs to
 * `external-capture-channel.unit.test.ts`, which drives it through the summaries instead.
