/**
 * Whether a capture handed to an external package's retained callback is charged.
 *
 * Its own test, over a dependency this file writes, because no other route exists. The external channel
 * needs an installed package with a locked version whose shipped implementation the analyzer can load,
 * and this workspace has none it can reach: a `workspace:*` dependency appears in `pnpm-lock.yaml` only
 * as `link:package/...`, never as a `name@version` key, so `packageVersionIsLocked` answers false for
 * every package the repo owns.
 *
 * Authoring one satisfies every gate, because `packageVersionIsLocked` walks ancestors of
 * `consumerProject.configFileName` rather than the repository root. A disposable consumer directory
 * therefore owns its own lockfile, its own configured project, and its own `node_modules`.
 *
 * What the authored lockfile does **not** prove: that pnpm would emit that key for a package installed
 * this way. It would not. A `file:` tarball is keyed `name@file:/absolute/path`, and a workspace link is
 * keyed `link:`, so neither reaches the gate. The key shape here is copied from this repository's own
 * `pnpm-lock.yaml`, and the gate under test reads a lockfile rather than an installer, so a copied shape
 * is the honest input. The boundary is worth stating rather than leaving implied.
 *
 * Driven through the effect summaries rather than through oxlint, which keeps this test about one thing.
 * The end-to-end falsification was run separately, and it produced both halves at once:
 *
 * ```text
 * consumer.ts:15: ... used by these calls: capture-retainer-probe@1.0.0 . retainCallback
 * consumer.ts:25: Parameter "config" should be readonly: property row is writable.
 * ```
 *
 * That run needed `--threads=1` at the time, because the whole external channel was then failing with
 * `spawn ENOMEM` under oxlint's default worker count. That was a separate defect, since fixed by starting
 * the external implementation child before oxlint reserves its per-worker buffers, and
 * `external-channel-workers.unit.test.ts` guards it at the default count. This test cannot see that
 * failure at all: plain `node` spawns the second child without trouble, which is exactly why the other
 * test exists.
 *

         * resolver accepting any existing path returns that directory, nothing loads from it, and this pair
         * fails. Both halves of the resolution are pinned by these two lines. */
