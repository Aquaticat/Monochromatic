/**

 * invoked with a spread. A mutant restoring the previous actual-position indexing survived the whole
 * suite, so the mapping had to be exercised directly or it would have landed untested.
 *
 * What the mapping being wrong costs is a dropped fact rather than an invented one. A proven mutation of
 * a later formal read an index that did not exist and recorded nothing, so an offer stood where the
