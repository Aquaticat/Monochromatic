/**
 * Substituting a callee's returned state into the caller that uses the result.
 *
 * The gap this closes was measured rather than predicted, and is recorded in
 * `doc/planning/prefer-readonly-return-substitution.md`, section "A second false offer,
 * on the array path". A callee that hands its own parameter back lets a caller mutate
 * caller-owned state through the returned value, and nothing attributed that write:
 * `launderMutable(rows,).push(...)` was offered `readonly Row[]`, the applied annotation
 * type-checked, and running it grew the caller's array.
 *
 * The syntax pass cannot close it alone. `directEffectSummary` sees one declaration and
 * no other callable's summary, so asking what a callee returns while walking its caller
 * would make the answer depend on which was analysed first, which `#29` forbids. The use
 * is therefore recorded where it is visible, and the origins are resolved here, where the
 * callee summary and the edge's formal-to-actual mapping sit together.
 *
 * This module only ever ADDS facts. Nothing discharges on the strength of a returned set
 * being empty, and nothing may: `doc/decision/prefer-readonly-result-provenance.md` makes
 * caller substitution the precondition for discharging receiver opacity, not a
 * consequence of it, and an empty returned set is equally consistent with a fresh result
 * and with a return shape this analysis does not model.
