/**
 * Four syntax sites that hand caller state outward and were answered by nothing.
 *
 * Found by walking escape channels rather than by working a queue, and both falsified: the
 * annotation applied, type-checked clean beside a control whose direct write was rejected, and
 * the driver observed the caller's row change.
 *
 * ```ts
 * bag.produce = new RowKeeper(constructed.row,).read;
 *
 * function* rows(): Generator<Row> {
 *   yield yielded.row;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * A construction and a yield are both handoffs, and neither is a call edge, a store, or a
 * return, which is why nothing recorded them. `NewExpression` appeared nowhere in this analysis
 * at all, and `YieldExpression` only where a result's escape is classified, never where a
 * return's origins are recorded.
 *
 * Each takes opacity through the handoff vocabulary, so each withholds silently. There is no call
 * for a reader to inspect in any of them, exactly as with a store.
 *
 * A tagged template and a throw joined the same way and for the same reason, so this module now
 * answers four sites rather than the two it was written for.
 *
 * ## Why each site asks about captures as well as origins
 *
 * Every recorder here maps ordinary parameter origins, and a closure that captures a parameter has
 * none: captures are kept beside ordinary origins on purpose, so nothing that reads only origins can
 * see one. Measured, all four sites recorded nothing at all for a handed closure, subject and control
 * alike:
 *
 * ```ts
 * new HandoffKeeper((): Row => config.row,)
 * yield (): Row => config.row;
 * throw { produce: (): Row => config.row, };
 * ```
 *
 * The activation premise does not cover these, and the distinction is exact. Activation covers effects
 * a closure body **performs**, which is why a direct write and a `throw config.row` inside an
 * activated closure are both charged. Returning `config.row` is neither a mutation nor an outward
 * handoff from the enclosing callable, and the consumer's later use of that returned value has no call
 * edge to carry it. `registry.register((): Row => registered.row,)` is the same semantic shape, was
 * activated, and still needed the capture channel. *
 * ## The activation premise, which decides what this module does not have to answer for
 *
 * A callable handed as an argument is activated, and an activated closure's body is scanned inline as
 * part of the enclosing callable, so every channel the enclosing callable has applies inside that
 * closure too. Stated in full in `effect-unresolved-capture.ts` under what decides whether to withhold.
 *
 * It is not visible from this file and it has caused the same wrong conclusion three times, always in
 * the same direction: a reading of one module predicts a hole that another module has already closed.
 * Measured instance, filed as a defect and closed as not one:
 * `registry.keep((): never => { throw config.row; },)` is charged, because the activated closure's body
 * is scanned here and `recordThrowHandoff` fires for the enclosing callable.
 *
 * So when reading this file, a channel here also applies to the body of any closure the enclosing
 * callable handed out. What activation does **not** cover is what invoking such a closure hands back,
 * because the consumer receives that value and no call edge carries it, which is why the capture
 * question is asked separately.
