/**
 * Reports whether the native service already holds a source under any materialized project.
 *
 * The question `openSemanticFile` has to answer before it announces a source is whether the
 * service already holds that path, which is not the same question as whether the source is
 * reusable from the project this bridge selected for it. The two diverge whenever the project
 * cache answers absent while an outer project's program has already read the file, and a source
 * announced as created is a source the service never rereads, so its overlay is ignored and its
 * types come from whatever text was read first.
 *
 * `getProjects` reads the snapshot's own project map with no request to the native child, and
 * `getSourceFileMetadata` asks per file without decoding the source, caching its answer on the
 * program. Both take TypeScript's path canonicalization, so a normalized source path is accepted
 * whatever the host spells paths like.
 *
 * @param snapshot - Snapshot the service is currently answering from.
 *
 * @param fileName - Normalized source path, per `normalizeSemanticFileName`.
 *
 * @returns whether any project in snapshot already holds source.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * snapshotHoldsSource({ snapshot, fileName });
 * ```
