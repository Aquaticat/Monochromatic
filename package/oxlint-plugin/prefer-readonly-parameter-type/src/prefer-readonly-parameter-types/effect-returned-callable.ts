/**
 * Caller origins a returned callable can reach once whoever received it invokes.
 *
 * Returning parameter-reachable state is permitted by `doc/decision/prefer-readonly-result-provenance.md`
 * on one stated condition: that callers keep tracking the value through the recorded returned
 * origins. `return config.row` satisfies it. `return (): Row => config.row` does not, because
 * `expressionOrigins` has no provenance successors for a function expression, so nothing is
 * recorded and no caller can substitute through it. The precondition fails rather than the
 * policy applying, which is what makes this a false offer instead of a permitted return.
 *
 * Opacity rather than a returned origin. A returned origin asserts that a caller can reach
 * these parameters through this result; what a returned callable carries is the capability to
 * reach them by invoking it. `packagedCallableOrigins` over-approximates, scanning the whole
 * subtree including nested callable bodies, and an over-approximation is safe on a channel
 * that withholds and unsafe on one that claims. Nothing today discharges on the strength of a
 * returned set, so the reuse would not break yet; it would state the wrong relation and break
 * as soon as something did.
 *
 * Silent, like every other retention. There is no call to name and no boundary a reader could
 * inspect, so the provenance goes through the retention vocabulary and the offer is simply
 * withheld.
 *
