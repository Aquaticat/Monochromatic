/**
 * Resolves parameter origins a binding takes from an expression's elements.
 *
 * The spelling of an element step decides nothing about its meaning, and three of the four
 * spellings carry no element-access node at all: `const [first] = copy`, `for (const row of
 * copy)` and `[...copy]` all reach an element without writing one. Resolving those as values
 * asks the container question where the element question was meant, and for a fresh
 * container the container answer is empty, which is a write attributed to nothing.
 *
 * The union is what makes it correct for both shapes. Iterating a parameter directly, `for
 * (const row of rows)`, reaches the parameter's own elements and the value origins already
 * answer it; iterating a container built from that parameter has empty value origins and the
 * container relation answers instead. Neither case has to know which it is.
 *
 * @param project - TypeScript project resolving declarations and symbols.
 *
 * @param bindingOriginBySymbolId - Known parameter and alias origins.
 *
 * @param node - Expression whose elements a binding receives.
 *
 * @returns origins reachable through the expression's elements.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * expressionElementOrigins({ project, bindingOriginBySymbolId, node: statement.expression });
 * ```

   * a charge, so a withheld origin is a withheld charge and a withheld charge is an offer.
   * Measured 2026-08-07: eight composed `slice` calls recorded the parameter and nine
   * recorded nothing, and at twelve the parameter came back with no opacity at all, which
   * is the state a read-only offer is minted from. Nine composed calls do not appear in the
   * corpus, so this cleared nothing; it removes a way to be wrong rather than a report.
