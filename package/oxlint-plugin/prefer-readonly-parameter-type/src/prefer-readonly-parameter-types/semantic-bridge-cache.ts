 * root a process reaches. `projectDiscoveryCount` is not a size but a running total, counting how
 * often the bridge had to ask TypeScript which project owns a source, and it resets only with
 * `closeSemanticBridge`. That total is what a root that never matches costs. Every other count
 * stays put under such a miss, so it is the one number that tells a served cache from a bypassed
 * one, and the evidence a host with its own path spelling can fail on.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const stats: SemanticBridgeCacheStats = {
 *   overlayCount: 1,
 *   projectRootCount: 1,
 *   projectDiscoveryCount: 1,

 * Walks upward and stops at the first directory that either names a discovered project or

 * past it and answering with an ancestor is how a package source came to be analysed under the
 * repository root, decided by nothing but which sources that worker reached earlier.
 *
 * `openSemanticFile` checks that the project it gets actually contains the source, which catches
 * a wrong answer for most projects. It does not catch this one: the root `tsconfig.json` declares
 * no `include`, so its program holds package sources too and the check passes.
 *
 * Measured on `package/module/logger/src/create-logger.ts`. Its own project analyses 117 sources
 * and the root project 196, but 62 of the 117 are absent from the root. Those 62 are callers, and
 * a caller that is not read is a mutation that is not charged, which is exactly how a wrong
 * read-only offer is minted.
 *
 * Answering absent where a nearer project has not been discovered costs one discovery. Answering
 * with an ancestor costs correctness.
