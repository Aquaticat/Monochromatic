/**
 * Records the receiver and argument opacity an unresolved call leaves behind.
 *
 * The two sides are separate obligations, which is why they are separate parameters
 * rather than one "did it derive" answer. A verified narrow member discharges what
 * the call does to its receiver and says nothing about where its arguments end up:
 * `values.with(0, replacement)` reaches no user code and still places `replacement`
 * inside the array it returns. An earlier attempt discharged both at once with a
 * single early return, which silently stopped reporting that escape.
 *
 * @param project - TypeScript project resolving receiver and argument types.
 *
 * @param bindingOriginBySymbolId - Current callable parameter and alias origins.
 *
 * @param call - Call expression no derivation could answer.
 *
 * @param allArgumentIndexes - Caller parameter roots per call argument.
 *
 * @param summary - Caller summary receiving opacity facts.
 *
 * @param receiverDerived - Whether the receiver claim is already answered.
 *
 * @mutates summary - Adds opaque parameter indexes and their provenance.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * recordOpaqueBoundary({ project, bindingOriginBySymbolId, call, allArgumentIndexes, summary, receiverDerived: false, });
