/**
 * Caller origins a callable handed straight to a call keeps for whoever receives it.
 *
 * The argument walk reads what an actual holds. A function expression holds nothing it can
 * read: what reaches a caller parameter is the body, and the body runs whenever whoever
 * received the callable decides. `parameterIndexes` therefore answers nothing for
 * `retain((): Row => config.row,)` while answering correctly for
 * `retainBox({ produce: (): Row => config.row, },)`, because the second is a literal it
 * descends and the first is not. Falsified before this existed: the annotation applied, type
 * checked clean, and the holder's invocation changed the caller's row.
 *
 * Recorded here and consumed in the fixed point rather than folded into the ordinary origins,
 * because the two license different things. An ordinary origin says the callee received this
 * caller parameter, so every effect the callee records on that formal is an effect on the
 * caller's value, including a write and a return. A capture says only that invoking the
 * callable can reach the parameter, which licenses nothing about writes the callee makes to
 * the callable itself and nothing about what the callee returns.
 *
 * Folding them together would also reach the unresolved boundary, since `parameterIndexes`
 * feeds that path too, and would withhold on `rows.map((row) => config.row.label,)` against
 * any callee this analysis cannot resolve. Kept on the owned edge, the question never arises
 * there: an unresolved call builds no edge to defer anything onto.
