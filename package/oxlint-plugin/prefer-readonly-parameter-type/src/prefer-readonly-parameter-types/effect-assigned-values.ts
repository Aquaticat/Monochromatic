/**
 * Values a binding is given by assignment, beside the one its declaration wrote.
 *
 * The walks that follow a binding to a callable follow its initializer, and a binding filled by assignment
 * names a value just as surely. Measured, with bodies identical except for how the binding is filled:
 *
 * ```text
 * storeAssignedSelector      opq=[1]     nothing recorded
 * storeInitializedSelector   opq=[1,0]   charged
 * ```
 *
 * ## Where this may be asked, and where it may not
 *
 * Two placements were tried before this one, and each failed differently, which is why the boundary is
 * written here rather than left to be rediscovered.
 *
 * In the general value walk it fixed the shape and broke an invariant two modules away, because that walk
 * feeds owned call edges: widening what a value can be widens what must already be summarised, and a newly
 * reachable callee had none when the index asserted completeness.
 *
 * In the completion gate it was a no-op, because that gate decides whether a completion can carry state and
 * says nothing about which origins are reachable.
 *
 * The reach walk is the placement that works. It records opacity and builds no edges, so widening it can
 * only withhold more, and it is what decides whether the caller's binding is reachable from a handed
 * closure at all.
 *
 * ## What it answers, and what it declines
 *
 * The enclosing body is found by ascending from the declaration, so no node universe is threaded in. An
 * earlier note claimed this fix needed one; it does not.
 *
 * Every assignment counts, whichever one a given read reaches, which over-approximates and therefore
 * withholds more: attributing too much costs an offer, and missing a value loses an escape. A binding
 * assigned from outside its declaring body is not reported, which withholds rather than claiming a value
 * the source never gave.
