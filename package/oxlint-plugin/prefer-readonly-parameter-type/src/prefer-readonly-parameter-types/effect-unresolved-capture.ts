/**
 * Caller opacity for a capture handed to a call this analysis cannot inspect.
 *
 * Captures were recorded on owned call edges only, and a call with no owned edge builds no edge to
 * record anything on. That was scoped deliberately, on the grounds that folding captures into
 * ordinary origins would withhold on `rows.map((row) => config.row.label,)` against every callee
 * this analysis cannot resolve. The scoping was right about the cost and wrong about the risk.
 *
 * Falsified twice. A continuation:
 *
 * ```ts
 * async function handInlineToContinuation(inlineThen: Config,): Promise<Row> {
 *   return await Promise.resolve()
 *     .then((): Row => inlineThen.row,);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * and an ordinary instance method:
 *
 * ```ts
 * class Registry {
 *   register(callback: () => Row,): void {
 *     callbackHolder.produce = callback;
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * function handToRegistry(registered: Config, registry: Registry,): void {
 *   registry.register((): Row => registered.row,);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The second is why this matters far beyond library calls. A possibly-overridden method is treated
 * as unresolved on purpose, because an override can write what the base only reads, so **every**
 * instance method that keeps a callback was losing the capture. Measured directly: the same
 * retainer written as an instance method records nothing for the captured parameter, written as a
 * static records `opaque=[0]`, written as a plain function records `opaque=[0]`.
 *
 * ## What decides whether to withhold
 *
 * Only what invoking the packaged callable hands back. Two facts make that the whole question.
 *
 * Writes the callable performs are already charged. A callable handed as an argument is activated
 * by `activateEscapedCallables`, so the body scan reaches it, and that is measured rather than
 * assumed: a writing closure handed to `setTimeout` and the same closure handed to an overridable
 * method both record `mutated=[0]`. This channel therefore needs to answer for nothing the callable
 * does to the origin, only for what it exposes.
 *
 * And what it exposes is bounded by its result. A callee that cannot be inspected may keep the
 * callable, invoke it now, invoke it later, store or write through what it produced. Every one of
 * those reaches the origin only through a value the callable handed back, so a callable whose every
 * completion is a leaf exposes nothing whatever the callee does. That is what keeps
 * `rows.map((row) => config.row.label,)` offered.
 *
 * The **actual** callable is inspected rather than the formal's declared callback type, because
 * TypeScript accepts a value-returning function where `() => void` is expected, so the formal can
 * conceal a row result entirely.
 *
 * A result this analysis cannot read counts as carrying state, which is what
 * `expressionCanCarryMutableState` already does with an absent type, and a callable whose body
 * cannot be read at all counts the same way.
 *
 * ## What it does not recover
 *
 * A known callee that discards what it was handed. `setTimeout` throws its callback's result away,
 * so withholding there is a precision loss this gate accepts rather than a soundness need. Proving
 * it needs a per-callee effect contract, since no local property of the call expression can
 * establish what an uninspectable implementation does with a value.
