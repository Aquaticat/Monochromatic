/**
 * Captures charged per external formal, which the external branch reached before nothing.
 *
 * `applyExternalEffect` maps external formals onto caller origins taken from argument positions, and a
 * closure argument has no origin of its own: captures are kept beside ordinary origins deliberately, so
 * a channel reading only origins cannot see one. The external branch then returns before
 * `recordOpaqueBoundary`, which is the only place captures were charged, so a capture handed to a
 * package this analysis **did** inspect was charged by nothing at all.
 *
 * Falsified against a dependency written for the purpose, in
 * `external-capture-channel.unit.test.ts`. The rule offered
 * `Parameter "config" should be readonly: property row is writable.` for a callable handing
 * `(): Row => config.row` to a package export that pushes it into a module-level array, while a sibling
 * callable in the same file reported that export by name and version, so the external path had provably
 * run.
 *
 * ## Why per formal rather than per call
 *
 * Charging every argument's captures whenever an external effect resolved would be sound and would
 * discard the precision the external branch exists for. An external summary is a proof about the shipped
 * implementation, so a formal it reports no fact about is a formal that implementation demonstrably does
 * not invoke, keep or write through, and a closure in that position exposes nothing.
 *
 * This is the design `exposedCaptureOrigins` was split out for, stated in its own documentation before
 * any of it could be measured.
 *
 * ## Which facts expose a capture, and which do not
 *
 * Invocation and opacity do, and they are separate facts rather than one: an implementation that calls a
 * handed callable records that formal as invoked, while one that keeps it records opacity, since a store
 * into a module binding is what opacity records. Each has its own case in the test for that reason.
 *
 * A proven mutation does not. Writing through a formal reaches what that formal already refers to rather
 * than anything invoking a callable in that position would hand back, and such a formal is charged
 * directly by `applyExternalEffect` regardless. Excluding it keeps this channel about exposure.
 *
 * ## Where it stays conservative
 *
 * A formal this mapping cannot place charges every argument's captures, exactly as `applyExternalEffect`
 * charges every argument's origins for one. The analysed implementation need not be the declaration the
 * consumer resolved, so a summary can name a formal this declaration does not declare, and guessing
 * which argument that was would be the one direction that loses a fact rather than an offer.

/**
 * Names the external formals whose handling can expose what a callable in that position hands back.
 *
 * Both sets are needed and each is pinned by its own case, because retention and invocation arrive as
 * different facts. A store into a module binding is recorded as an opaque formal, and a formal the
 * implementation calls is recorded as an invoked one. Measured by deleting each in turn: dropping
 * invocation fails only the case whose export invokes, dropping opacity only the case whose export
 * keeps.
 *
 * `callbackRelations` is deliberately not consulted, which is a correction rather than an omission. A
 * relation names the formal the implementation feeds **into** a callback, never the formal **holding**
 * one, so asking what a callable in that position exposes asks about the wrong argument: on a real
 * shape the source actual is the value being passed along, which holds no callable, and the mutant
 * removing this branch survived the whole suite.
 *
 * What that branch looked like it was for is covered already. An implementation that calls a handed
 * callback records that formal as invoked, which the invoked case pins directly, and whatever the
 * relation exposes about the caller's own values is charged by `applyExternalEffect` through their
 * ordinary origins.
 *
 * @param externalEffect - Proven external implementation effect.
 *
 * @returns formal positions to charge, repeats included since charging twice adds nothing.
