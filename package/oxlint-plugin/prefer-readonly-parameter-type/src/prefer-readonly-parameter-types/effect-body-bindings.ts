/**
 * Everything the body scan has to know about its own locals before it starts.

 * value and answers two questions about every local, which parameter slots it can reach and
 * which call filled it. The scan that follows consults both and writes the summary.
 *
 * Keeping the two discoveries together matters more than keeping either beside its caller.
 * They walk the same three node lists, they converge in the same loop shape, and a change
 * to what counts as a binding has to reach both or the maps disagree about the same local.
