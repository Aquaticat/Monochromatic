/**
 * Which call's result each local binding can be holding.
 *
 * A parallel to `bindingOriginBySymbolId` and deliberately not part of it. That map answers
 * which parameter slots a binding can reach, and it is built by `expressionOrigins`, which
 * stops at a `CallExpression` because a callee's summary does not exist while its callers
 * are walked. So `const local = firstRow(config,)` leaves `local` with no origins, and
 * `local.label = 'written'` attributes nothing, which offered `readonly` for a parameter
 * the callable writes through.
 *
 * Filling those origins later cannot fix it. Attribution happens during the syntactic pass,
 * and the callee summary only exists during the fixed point, so by the time the origins
 * could be known the write has already been walked and not recorded. What crosses that gap
 * is the same deferral the rest of this analysis uses: record the call the binding came
 * from, resolve the origins where the callee summary sits.
 *
 * Kept beside the origins rather than folded into them because the two answer different
 * questions and converge for different reasons. Origins accumulate parameter slots and
 * settle when no binding gains one. These accumulate call-site keys, and an entry here is
 * never refined by the fixed point: it names a syntactic fact about where a value came
 * from, which is complete as soon as the declarations have been walked.
