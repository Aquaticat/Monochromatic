/**
 * Retention recorded for every argument a call receives.
 *
 * An argument that is a call result carries caller state the origin walk cannot see, because a callee's
 * summary does not exist while its callers are walked. So `sink.push(firstRow(config,),)` handed the
 * caller's row to a container and attributed nothing, and `keepRow(firstRow(config,),)` did the same
 * through an owned callee. Both falsified.
 *
 * Recorded as a retention against the inner call site and resolved in the fixed point, which is the same
 * deferral the write and store sites use. Retention rather than a mutation claim because handing a value
 * to a call is a handoff and not a write, and it withholds silently, which is what a reader can do
 * nothing about.
 *
 * Over-approximating: the receiving call may only read what it was given. The leaf gate takes the common
 * half of that away, since an argument that cannot carry mutable state records nothing, and what remains
 * withholds rather than offers.
 *
 * Its own module because two paths need it and one of them used to return before reaching it. A call to
 * a callback parameter is classified, answered and returned early, so `rowCallee(passResultRow(cfg.row,),)`
 * recorded nothing at all and was indistinguishable from a control handing over a freshly allocated row,
 * while the same result handed to an unresolvable member recorded `opaque=[0]`. Falsified with a driver
 * whose supplied callee retained the row and wrote through it.
 *
