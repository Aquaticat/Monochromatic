/**
 * Caller origins a callable packaged inside a call-argument literal can hand over.
 *
 * The argument walk reads the value each property holds. When that value is a callable,
 * or when the property is an accessor or a method and has no readable value at all, the
 * parameter it reaches lives in a body the callee runs, not in anything the walk can see.
 * Three measured forms in the result-provenance fixture produced the same defect, each
 * recording no origin while the callee wrote through what came back:
 * `accessorPackagedEffect` uses `get unnamed() { return row; }`,
 * `methodReturnPackagedEffect` uses a method, and `arrowReturnPackagedEffect` uses an
 * ordinary property holding an arrow. Each was offered `row` as readonly.
 *
 * This covers callables nested inside a packaged literal, which is exactly where the
 * callback relation has no reach: `callbackKeys` is recorded per argument position, so a
 * callable handed over directly is resolved and analyzed as a callback, while one wrapped
 * in a literal is invisible to it.
 *
 * The body is scanned rather than evaluated, and every binding it names contributes,
 * whatever position it appears in. That over-approximates, which is the direction that
 * costs a withheld offer rather than a wrong one, and it needs no claim about which of
 * several returns runs.
