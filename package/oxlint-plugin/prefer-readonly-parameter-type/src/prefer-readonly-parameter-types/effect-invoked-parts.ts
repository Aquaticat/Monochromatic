/**
 * What one node invokes, whichever syntax spells the invocation.
 *
 * The activation walk matched `CallExpression` and nothing else, so two other invoking syntaxes left
 * their callee unactivated and its body unscanned. That is the cost, and it is not about what either
 * syntax receives: a store inside an unactivated closure is attributed to nobody.
 *
 * Measured, each against the same body written as an ordinary call, which recorded `opaque=[0]`:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const storingTag = (_strings: TemplateStringsArray,): void => { holder.kept = gotten.row; };
 * storingTag``;
 *
 * class BodyStorer {
 *   constructor() {
 *     holder.kept = gotten.row;
 *   }
 * }
 * void new BodyStorer();
 * ```
 *
 * Both recorded nothing. A field initializer in the construction's position is charged already, so the
 * gap there is the constructor body rather than the class.
 *
 * Named as its own module because the question is one concept and the activation walk had reached its
 * line budget. Adding a fourth invoking syntax is a clause here rather than an edit at four call sites,
 * which is the shape the tagged-template fix was written for and the construction fix then reused.
 *

 *
 * ```ts
 * const storingTag = (_strings: TemplateStringsArray,): void => { holder.kept = gotten.row; };

 * the closure unactivated, and an unactivated body's store is attributed to nobody.

 * Interpolated values answer as actuals, because a tag receives them exactly as a call receives
 * arguments. The strings array is not among them: it is built at the call site rather than handed in.
