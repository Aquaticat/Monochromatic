/**
 * Tests whether a call's result leaves state unaccounted for.
 *
 * This replaces a test that read type shape where the claim is about provenance:
 * `rows.map(row => ({ chars: row.count }))` builds objects holding one number that share
 * nothing with the caller, and it was refused because `Row` is not primitive. That refusal
 * is the defect issue #414 reports, and no rewrite resolves it.
 *
 * Replaced rather than removed, because deleting it outright is unsound for `toSorted`,
 * which builds a fresh array of the receiver's own elements while its observer only compares
 * them. No relation names that result and no observer fact does either, so it would discharge
 * with a write through the sorted copy attributed to nothing.
 *
 * So a state-carrying result must have a relation covering it:
 *
 * - an observer-derived result is answered by `propagateElementApplications`, which marks the
 *   receiver opaque when the observer hands its element back;
 * - a container of receiver elements is answered by the element step, which attributes writes
 *   through it, and additionally has to stay inside this callable, because nothing attributes
 *   a use that leaves;
 * - a single receiver element handed back on its own, `find` and `findLast`, is answered the
 *   same way and held to the same escape condition, since it is the same state reached by a
 *   shorter route;
 * - anything else keeps failing closed exactly as before.
 *
 * The aliasing test is the fallback for a member with no relation, and it yields to one that
 * has it. `filter` returns `Slice[]` from `readonly Slice[]`, whose element type is the
 * receiver's own by identity, so running it first refuses exactly the containers the relation
 * was built to describe. Measured: with the relation verified and the escape question
 * answered, `plainFilterCount` stayed opaque while its result never left the callable. What
 * the fallback still catches is what it was written for: `rows.reduce((kept) => kept)` hands
 * back the accumulator it was given, and `reduce` has no relation.
 *
 * @param project - TypeScript project proving default-library ownership.
 *
 * @param checker - TypeScript checker resolving signature and types.
 *
 * @param call - View call whose result is being accounted for.
 *
 * @param resultType - Instantiated result type of this call.
 *
 * @param elementTypes - Types the receiver view is instantiated over.
 *
 * @param body - Enclosing callable body, absent when there is none to scan.
 *
 * @returns whether the result carries state no relation accounts for.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * viewResultUnaccounted({ project, checker, call, resultType, elementTypes, body });

   * carry a verified relation saying the result is one of the receiver's own elements, and
   * this gate asked only the observer and container questions, so a member holding that
   * relation reached the fallback and failed closed. `at` carries the same relation and
   * never showed it, because it takes no observer and so answers from the channel table
   * before this gate is reached. Measured: `find` over a collection of objects was opaque
   * while `at` over the same collection was clean, and `find` over primitives was clean
   * too, which is what named the result rather than the member as the cause.
   *
   * Held to the container arm's standard rather than the observer's, for the same reason:
   * the element is caller state, writes through it are attributed by the element step, and
   * nothing attributes a use that leaves the callable.
