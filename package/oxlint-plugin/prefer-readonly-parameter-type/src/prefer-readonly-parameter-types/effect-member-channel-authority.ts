 * these members widens nothing: the assumption is pre-existing, not introduced here.
 *
 * "Own-index access" is wider than `Get` and `Set`, and an earlier version of this
 * comment named only those two, which made the channel look narrower than the members
 * in it. Measured against a fully trapped receiver: `indexOf`, `lastIndexOf`,
 * `unshift`, `copyWithin`, `reverse` and `shift` reach `has`, and `pop` and `shift`
 * reach `deleteProperty`. Every one of those is still inside the baseline, because the
 * baseline is what this rule accepts on a parameter, not what an implementation was
 * guessed to do: `0 in values` keeps a read-only offer, and `delete values[0]` reports
 * a plain mutation. `effect-member-channel-traps.unit.test.ts` derives that baseline
 * executably and fails any member reaching outside it.
 *
 * The assumption is worth naming, because it is load-bearing and unsound in the
 * exotic case. Measured: an accessor installed at index 0 that pushes during its
 * getter turns `includes` into a call that restructures its own receiver, taking a
 * one-element array to two. The identical getter fires for `values[0]`. So this

 * The union is also the conservative representation, not merely the convenient one.
 * A member whose creation is narrow and whose drainage is not would take the wider
