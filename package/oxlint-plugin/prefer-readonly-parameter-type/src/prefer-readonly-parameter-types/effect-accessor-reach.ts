/**
 * Callables a body reaches by reading a property rather than by calling anything.
 *
 * The reach walk follows calls, so it answers for a closure that calls a sibling and misses one that
 * reads an accessor. Measured, with the configuration offered:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const holder = {
 *   get row(): Row {
 *     return gottenOut.row;
 *   },
 * };
 * registry.keep((): Row => holder.row,);
 * ```
 *
 * The handed closure names `holder` and nothing else. Resolving `holder` finds no parameter origin,
 * because it is a local rather than a parameter, and the call walk finds no call, because a property
 * read is not one. So the reach walk answered empty while reading `holder.row` runs a body that
 * hands back the caller's row.
 *
 * A getter is the sharp case and the walk does not stop there. Any callable a literal declares is
 * collected, accessors and methods alike, because a property read can hand a method onward as a
 * value just as it can run a getter. Which property was read is not tracked, exactly as the
 * aggregate descent elsewhere declines to track keys: narrowing to one member would need a claim
 * this walk cannot support, and taking all of them can only add an origin.
 *
