 * Resolves the receiver whose elements an expression's container value holds.

 * The container relation is recorded on a call, and code rarely writes through the call
 * expression itself: `rows.filter(kept)[0].label = 'x'` is legal and unusual, while
 * `const kept = rows.filter(keeps); kept[0].label = 'x'` is the shape that appears. So the
 * question has to survive local hops, and this follows a binding to its declaration's
 * initializer until it reaches a call or runs out.
 *
 * Only a declaration initializer is followed, never a later assignment. A reassigned local
 * therefore keeps answering for the container it was declared with, which over-attributes
 * rather than under-attributes: the write is credited to a receiver whose elements the
 * local may no longer hold, which costs precision and never an offer.
 *
 * @param project - TypeScript project resolving declarations and default-library ownership.
 *
 * @param checker - TypeScript checker resolving signatures and types.
 *
 * @param node - Expression whose value may be a container of receiver elements.
 *
 * @returns receiver expression, or sentinel when nothing proves the relation.

 * @example
 * ```ts
 * containerElementReceiver({ project, checker, node: elementAccess.expression });

   * A hop count sat beside it and has been removed. Its stated reason was cost, saving a
   * declaration resolution per hop on chains it said do not appear in the corpus, and its
   * stated consequence was that stopping early "only withholds an origin". That is backwards
   * for this rule. Withholding an origin withholds a charge, every consumer of these origins
   * only ever adds one, and a parameter with no charge is a parameter offered read-only.
   *
   * Measured at the count's threshold, chaining a container call through local aliases and
   * writing through an element of the last: at three aliases the write is attributed to the
   * parameter, and from seven onward the parameter comes back with no mutation and no
   * opacity at all. Not an unattributed write but a clean parameter, which is the state a
   * read-only offer is minted from, on a callable that rewrites a row the caller owns.
