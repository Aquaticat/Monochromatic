/**
 * Whether a callee's declared result type is a claim about a body or about a slot.
 *
 * The completion gate trusts a declared return type whenever it cannot resolve the callee to a body it
 * can read. That trust is right for most types and wrong for one, and the difference is a specific rule
 * in the language rather than anything about this analysis.
 *
 * TypeScript permits assigning a value-returning function where a `void`-returning one is expected. It
 * does not permit the same substitution for any other return type. Verified against the compiler rather
 * than recalled, with the control carrying the directive so an unused one would have reported:
 *
 * ```ts
 * export const acceptedAsVoid: () => void = produceRow;
 * // @ts-expect-error a row-returning callable is not assignable where a string-returning one is wanted
 * export const acceptedAsString: () => string = produceRow;
 * ```
 *
 * So `void` on a callable *type* constrains nothing about what the callable returns, while `string`
 * constrains it. Measured, that gap left a capture certified inert: a formal annotated `() => void`,
 * invoked inside a closure handed to a registry, while the caller passed `(): Row => config.row` and
 * the registry handed that row out.
 *
 * The distinction is not `void` against other types on its own. It is whether the annotation belongs to
 * a body or to a slot. An ambient `declare function` states `void` about its own implementation, and
 * nothing can substitute a different body for it. A parameter, a mutable local or a member signature
 * names a slot whose runtime value the language permits to return something.
 *
