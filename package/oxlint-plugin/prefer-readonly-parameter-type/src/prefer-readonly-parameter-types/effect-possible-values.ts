/**
 * Every expression one expression can evaluate to, without evaluating anything.
 *
 * The store path asks what a value handed outward can be, and it had been asking by testing
 * syntax: is this written as a callable. That answered for the inline form and missed the two
 * shapes ordinary source actually writes, both falsified:
 *
 * ```ts
 * holder.produce = condition ? ((): Row => config.row) : fallback;
 *
 * const box = { produce: (): Row => config.row, };
 * holder.box = box;
 * ```
 *
 * A branch per form is what this exists to avoid. The question is one question, so it gets one
 * walk, and the callers then ask their own questions of each answer: whether it is a callable,
 * or what origins it packages.
 *
 * Additive rather than substitutive. Every node reports itself alongside whatever it can be
 * followed to, so a caller that already handled the written form keeps handling it. An
 * identifier aliasing `config.row` therefore still answers with the identifier, whose origins
 * the binding map holds, as well as with the initializer it was bound to.
 *
 * What it refuses to enter is as load-bearing as what it follows. A call is not descended,
 * because a call's result is a separate relation with its own deferral machinery, and claiming
 * the callee expression is a possible result would make every call look like its own callee. A
 * conditional's condition, an assignment's target, a computed key, a discarded operand and any
 * arithmetic operand are not values the expression evaluates to. A nested callable's body is
 * not entered either, because what a callable can be is the callable, and what it can reach is
 * the question `effect-callable-capture-closure.ts` answers.

/**
 * Names every callable one actual can hold.
 *
 * The two ways to answer see different things, and this composes them rather than choosing.
 * `callableDeclaration` follows a local's initializer and stops at a parameter, so a callable
 * arriving as a parameter default was named by nothing: `retain(callback,)`, where `callback`
 * defaults to a closure over the caller's configuration, offered that configuration while the
 * closure `retain` kept wrote through it. Falsified.
 *
 * Filtering the value walk to values already written as callable declarations was the first repair,
 * and it answered for a default written inline and for nothing named. `possibleValueNodes` follows a
 * parameter to the identifier its default names and stops there, and an identifier is not a callable
 * declaration, so a default naming an ordinary function resolved to no callable at all. Measured:
 * storing what a block-bodied named default handed back left the configuration offered, while the
 * same callee reached directly or through a local alias charged it.
 *
 * So every value is now resolved rather than tested, and the results are keyed by source span so one
 * declaration reached by several values answers once. That also picks up a conditional and an alias,
 * which the filter missed for the same reason it missed the named default.
 *
 * Kept out of the callback identity beside it, which stays with the narrow resolver: naming a
 * default as the callable a callee invokes would claim the default's effects for a call where the
 * caller supplied something else, and that claim can be wrong in the offering direction. Whereas
 * every consumer of a capture asks what the callee stated about its own formal first, so widening
 * what fills a formal can only ever add an effect the callee already declared.
 *
 * Lives beside the value walk it is one filter over, because both the unresolved boundary and the
 * reach walk need the same answer and the reach walk cannot import it from a module that imports
 * the reach walk.
 *
 * Exported because the unresolved boundary needs the same answer. An earlier note here said a
 * capture only ever adds opacity, which stopped being true once captures began feeding the mutation
 * and returned-origin channels as well.
 *
 * @param project - TypeScript project resolving values an expression can hold.
 *
