/**
 * Settled classifications by semantic type ID, per project.
 *
 * The memo inside `classifyReadonlyType` is created per call, which is correct for the cycle
 * marker it also holds and far narrower than the repetition it faces: a `Row` named by two
 * hundred callables was walked two hundred times, and each walk redid every property, element
 * and signature beneath it. Measured at 4.2ms per callable in
 * `doc/planning/oxlint-warm-sweep-attribution.md`.
 *
 * Safe to share because the classification depends on nothing but the type. Every use of
 * `checker` and `project` inside the walk is derived from the type being classified: its own
 * declaration handle, its base constraint, whether it is an array, its type arguments.
 *
 * Keyed on the project because a type ID means nothing outside the checker that issued it, which
 * is the same boundary the result is valid within, so the key cannot collide across instances.
 * `effect-final-index-cache.ts` keys its own store the same way.
 *
 * Withholding an assumed result is what makes the store an identity rather than an accident of
 * order. `classify` answers `HONEST_READONLY` for a type already being walked above it, and that
 * answer is only resolved by the walk that made the assumption. Every other member of the cycle
 * finishes standing on it, so publishing those would let whichever parameter a worker classified
 * first decide what a later one means.
