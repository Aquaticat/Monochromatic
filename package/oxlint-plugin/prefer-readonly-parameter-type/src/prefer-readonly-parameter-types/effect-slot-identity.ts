 * write is what offers `readonly` for state something mutates, and nothing in the type system
 * or the test suite would have caught it. The brands turn every such site into a compile
 * error instead.
 *
 * Property keys stay plain strings. A brand there would need an assertion function with
 * nothing to assert, since every string is a possible property name, and a vacuous check
 * reads as a proof that was never performed.
