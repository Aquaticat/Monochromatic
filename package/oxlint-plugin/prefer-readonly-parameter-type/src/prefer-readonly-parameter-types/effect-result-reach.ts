/**
 * Every expression a value can have come from, for finding the call underneath it.
 *
 * `expressionResultSites` normalises access layers and identity-keeping wrappers and then asks
 * whether a call underlies what is left. That answers for `firstRow(config,).row` and for an
 * alias hop, and it stops at the first shape that is neither, which left a family of writes
 * attributing nothing. All of these were falsified, with every offer applied, type-checking
 * clean beside a control whose direct write was rejected, and a driver observing the change:
 *
 * ```ts
 * (pick ? firstRow(config,) : firstRow(config,)).label = 'written';
 *
 * const { row, } = { row: firstRow(config,), };
 * row.label = 'written';
 *
 * return [firstRow(config,),][0] as Row;
 * ```
 *
 * A conditional, a property of a literal, and an element of one.
 * Each holds what a call handed back, and the normalisation walk cannot see through any of them,
 * because each is a place a value came from rather than a layer over it.
 *
 * Two relations, kept apart on purpose. Value sources are what `effect-possible-values.ts`
 * already answers, and reusing it here rather than restating it is the point. Aggregate members
 * are added on top, and only here: that walk answers what a value **is** for deciding callable
 * identity, where descending a literal would be wrong, while this one asks where a value can
 * have **come from**, where descending it is the whole question.
 *
 * Widening this walk can only add call sites, and adding one can only add an effect, so every
 * shape it reaches is a hole closed rather than a risk taken.
