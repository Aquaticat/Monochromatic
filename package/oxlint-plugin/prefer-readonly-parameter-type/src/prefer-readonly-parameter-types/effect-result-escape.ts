/**
 * Whether a tracked call result can leave the callable that produced it.

 * This is the condition that licenses discharging a verified member call's receiver
 * opacity. The opacity report exists because nothing tracked the result as an alias;
 * once provenance tracks it, the report is redundant exactly while every use of the
 * result is one the analysis attributes. A use that leaves the callable is not, so the
 * report has to stay for those.
 *
 * Returning parameter-reachable state is benign by accepted policy, since the caller
 * already holds the parameter. That policy is about the callee not being blamed, not
 * about the value becoming untracked: until a caller substitutes through
 * `directReturned`, a returned result is still a use this analysis cannot follow, so it
