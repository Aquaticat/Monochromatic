/**
 * Collects local bindings whose value is a container this callable constructed.

 * Separate from the origin map on purpose, and additive to it. `expressionValueOrigins`
 * answers which caller parameters an expression's value can reach, and `[root,]` really
 * can reach `root`, so recording that is correct for every consumer asking that question.
 * One consumer asks a different one. `recordCollectionMemberEffect` charges the receiver's
 * origins when a member restructures its receiver, and `stack.pop()` restructures the
 * fresh array rather than the parameter inside it: a container reaching the parameter is
 * not the parameter reaching the container.
 *
 * Rather than emptying the origins, which would lose every write made *through* the
 * container and is costed in `doc/planning/prefer-readonly-container-value-provenance.md`,
 * this records the provenance shape beside them and lets exactly one charge consult it.
 * Nothing else changes, so `const stack = [root,]; stack[0].label = x` keeps its
 * attribution through the element path.
 *
 * Three conditions, each load-bearing. The name must be a plain identifier, because a
 * destructuring pattern binds what a container holds rather than the container. The
 * declaration must be `const`, so the value cannot be replaced by one this callable did
 * not build. The initializer must be an array or object literal written here, or an
 * identifier already recorded, which is what carries the record across
 * `const alias = stack;` the way origins already cross it.
 *
 * A binding initialized from a property, a parameter, or a call is deliberately absent.
 * `const inner = config.rows; inner.push(row,);` writes a container the caller owns, and
 * the charge on it has to stand.
 *
 * @param project - TypeScript project resolving binding symbols.
 *
 * @param variableDeclarations - Body declarations eligible for the record.
