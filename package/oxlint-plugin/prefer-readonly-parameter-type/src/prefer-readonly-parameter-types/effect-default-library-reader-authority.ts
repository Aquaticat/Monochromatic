/**
 * Default-library functions that read a caller-owned value passed as an argument.
 *
 * The collection authority answers `receiver.member(...)`, where the caller-owned value is
 * the receiver. `Object.entries(value)` puts it in argument position instead, with a
 * global as the receiver, so nothing in that path reaches it and every caller-owned value
 * handed to one of these took an opaque boundary. Measured across the repository: 73
 * findings name one of these and nothing else, so they clear entirely, and 25 more name
 * one alongside another unresolved call.
 *
 * The channel claim lives here rather than in `effect-member-channel-authority.ts`, and
 * the attempt to put it there is worth recording. That module's table is keyed by
 * interface owner and consumed by a probe that calls each listed member on a receiver of
 * that interface. These are static functions taking an operand, so the probe reported
 * `ObjectConstructor.hasOwn is not callable on the probe receiver` and refused the
 * entries. It was right to: an instance member reached through a receiver and a static
 * function reached through an argument are different claims, and merging them would have
 * made that table's evidence mean two things at once.
 *
 * The claim itself: each of these performs `Get(value, key)` for own enumerable string
 * keys, which runs an accessor if the caller installed one. That is the channel
 * `value.key` already opens, and this rule treats a plain property read as a pure read, so
 * admitting these widens nothing that was not already assumed. Narrower than it may read,
 * too: the key list is taken before any value is read, so an accessor firing mid-walk
 * cannot add or remove entries from the result. `effect-default-library-reader.unit.test.ts`
 * establishes both against a fully trapped object rather than restating them.
 *
