/**
 * Caller origins a callable can reach, including through calls to callables beside it.
 *
 * `packagedCallableOrigins` is lexical: it names every binding the packaged body mentions and
 * follows no call out of it. That answers the question for a closure that reads what it
 * captured directly, and misses one that reaches caller state only by calling a sibling:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const read = (): Row => config.row;
 * holder.produce = (): Row => read();
 * ```
 *
 * The stored arrow names only `read`, and a local bound to a function expression carries no
 * parameter origin, so the lexical scan came back empty and the parameter was offered.
 * Falsified: the annotation applied, type-checked clean beside a control whose direct write was
 * rejected, and the driver changed the caller's row through the stored closure.
 *
 * Same cause as the over-reporting in the other direction, pointing the other way. A lexical
 * scanner is answering a call-graph question, so it is wrong twice: it names bindings a
 * read-only body merely mentions, and it misses captures that leave through a call.
 *
 * The bound is the source file, and it is a cost bound rather than a soundness one. An earlier
 * version of this paragraph claimed the reverse; a mutant that deleted the bound survived the
 * whole suite, which is what showed the claim was backwards.
 *
 * Why it cannot change an answer: `packagedCallableOrigins` resolves each named binding to a
 * symbol and looks that symbol up in the origin map of the callable being summarised. A
 * cross-file callee's body names its own symbols, which are absent from that map, so following
 * it contributes nothing. It also loses nothing, because a callable able to capture those
 * bindings must be written inside the callable that owns them and is therefore in the same
 * file.
 *
 * So the bound exists to stop the walk crossing the workspace for answers it cannot change.
 * No assertion can defend it, and none pretends to: the cost it avoids is unmeasured, and a
 * mutation check over summaries is the wrong instrument for a claim about work rather than
 * about results. *
 * ## The activation premise, which decides what this walk does not have to answer for
 *
 * A callable handed as an argument is activated, and an activated closure's body is scanned inline as
 * part of the enclosing callable, so every channel the enclosing callable has applies inside that
 * closure too. Stated in full in `effect-unresolved-capture.ts` under what decides whether to withhold.
 *
 * It is not visible from this file and it has caused the same wrong conclusion three times: a reading
 * of one module predicts a hole another module has already closed. Writes a reached callable performs
 * are already charged for that reason, so this walk answers only for what invoking one hands back.

 * claimed a returned origin.
 *
 * Answered with what the callable can reach rather than with what it returns. Over-approximating,
 * since the callable may return something freshly allocated, and it is the direction that
 * withholds.
 *
 * An earlier version of this paragraph said a callable written inside the one being summarised has no
 * summary of its own, and that a precise answer would need nested callables to carry one. Both halves
 * are false and the claim was load-bearing enough that two separate reviews reasoned from it, one of
 * them concluding a defect had a cause it did not have.
 *
 * A nested callable does have a summary, and consumers do read it. Measured twice. A write through a
 * defaulted closure's own formal reaches the caller, `invokeWritingDefault` recording
 * `mutated=[0,1]`, which can only travel through that callable's summary. And once #98 gave a concise
 * body its returned fact, a store of what a nested default handed back began charging through
 * `propagateResultApplications`, which reads `summaries.get(edge.calleeKey)` and skips when it finds
 * nothing.

 * over-approximating answer for what a callee reaches, which is a different question from what it
 * hands back.
