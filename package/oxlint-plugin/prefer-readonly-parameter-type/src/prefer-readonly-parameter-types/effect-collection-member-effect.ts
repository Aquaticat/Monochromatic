 * and invokes a caller-supplied factory; `Array.sort(comparator)` reorders and
 * invokes the comparator. Each records its mutation and then, separately, has its
 * observers analyzed.
 *
 * Only a fully answered call is discharged. A restructuring member whose
 * reachable user code cannot be derived reports its mutation and still falls
 * through to the opaque boundary, so a bare `Array.sort()`, which reorders and
 * runs the default comparator's string coercion, ends up both mutated and
