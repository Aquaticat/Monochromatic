/**
 * Tests whether a call result is receiver state rather than something newly built.
 *
 * Matches by `Type` identity against the receiver's instantiated element types,
 * because the member's signature is instantiated with those arguments, so receiver
 * state appearing in a result is the identical instance rather than an equivalent
 * one. Only state-carrying matches count, since sharing a primitive element type
 * exposes nothing: `readonly string[]` filtered to `string[]` copies primitives.
 *
 * Receiver identity is deliberately not matched. A member returning the receiver
 * itself, `sort` and `reverse`, is a mutator, so the structural claim has already
 * recorded the mutation and nothing reachable through the result is new. Matching it
 * here regressed `mutableSortObserverEffect` from a derived mutation to a mutation
 * plus an opaque boundary, which is the rule saying it cannot tell about a call it
 * fully understands.
 *
 * @param checker - TypeScript checker resolving result type arguments.
 *
 * @param resultType - Instantiated result type of one call.
 *
 * @param elementTypes - Types the receiver collection is instantiated over.
 *
 * @returns whether result may alias caller-owned receiver state.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * resultAliasesReceiverState({ checker, resultType, elementTypes, });
 * ```
