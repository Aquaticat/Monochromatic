   * feeds it and is told nothing, so `firstRow(config,).label = 'written'` recorded no
   * write at all.
   *
   * That was a false offer rather than a precision gap, and the falsification is in
   * `doc/planning/prefer-readonly-return-substitution.md`, section "The write path never
   * asks what a call returned". `firstRow` and `writeThroughOwnedCall` were both offered
   * `ReadonlyDeep`, applying both type-checked under TypeScript 7.0.2, and running the
   * pair printed the caller's row with the written label. It compiles because assignability
   * ignores `readonly` property modifiers, so a callee declaring `Row` hands a
   * `ReadonlyDeep<Row>` back as mutable with no diagnostic.
   *
   * The root is passed rather than the whole target because the write lands on the call's
   * result, not on a projection of it. `deferrableResultSite` unwraps the identity-keeping
   * wrappers itself, so only the access layers have to come off here. */
