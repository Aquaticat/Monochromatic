/**
 * Tests whether a node is written directly in one body rather than in a callable under it.
 *
 * One question two separate steps were each answering with their own ascent.
 * `resultEscapesCallable` asks it to treat a captured reference as escaping, because a use
 * inside a nested callable outlives its reasoning about statement order. The returned-result
 * discharge asks it because caller enumeration is performed for the body it was handed, and a
 * `return` written inside a nested declaration belongs to that declaration instead:
 *
 * ```ts
 * function outer(rows: Row[],): () => Row[] {
 *   function inner(): Row[] {
 *     return rows.slice(0,);
 *   }
 *   return inner;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The call is returned outright and the callers being enumerated are `outer`'s, which
 * substitute for `outer` alone. Whoever later calls `inner` writes through the result with
 * nothing attributing it, so answering this wrongly is the guarded failure directly.
 *
 * Ascending rather than descending, because the containment question is asked of one node
 * against one body and an ascent visits only that node's ancestors. The walk stops on an
 * absent parent as well as a self-referential one, for the reason `effect-value-consumer.ts`
 * records: a source file's parent is `undefined` here while the declared type says otherwise,
 * so a walk that trusts the type runs past the root.
 *
 * Both exits answer false, which is the conservative direction for each caller. A node not
 * inside the body at all is one neither caller can reason about, and the escape test's own
 * note that "every caller passes a node inside `body`" makes that exit unreachable rather
 * than merely unlikely.
 *
 * @param node - Node being placed.
 *
 * @param body - Body it is expected to belong to.
 *
 * @returns whether the node's nearest enclosing callable body is exactly that body.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * writtenDirectlyInBody({ node: call, body });
 * ```
