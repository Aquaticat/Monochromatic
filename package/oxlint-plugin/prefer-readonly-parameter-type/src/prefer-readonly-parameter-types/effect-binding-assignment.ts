/**
 * Tests whether a name is written anywhere inside a body.
 *
 * The endpoint test a walk proving absence needs, and the one a declaration cannot supply.
 * `bindingIsReassignable` answers for a `let` because the declaration itself carries the
 * answer, and a parameter carries none: it is declared once and may still be pointed
 * somewhere else by any statement in the body.
 *
 * That matters because the ownership marker does not stop it. `ForeignBorrowed<Value>` is
 * `Value & { readonly [MARKER]?: true; }` and the marker property is optional, so a
 * `ForeignBorrowed<Row[]>` value assigns to a plain `Row[]` parameter with no error at all:
 *
 * ```ts
 * function expose(owned: Row[], foreign: ForeignBorrowed<Row[]>,): Row[] {
 *   owned = foreign;
 *   return owned.slice(0,);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Classifying `owned` reads the declared type and finds nothing foreign, while the value
 * reaching `slice` is the foreign one. The type system permits the assignment, so refusing
 * a written name is what has to catch it.
 *
 * Scanned rather than resolved through the checker, because the question is about this body
 * and a symbol's write sites are not something a declaration reports.
 *
 * @param project - TypeScript project resolving binding symbols.
 *
 * @param body - Body the walk is reasoning within.
 *
 * @param node - Name the walk stopped at.
 *
 * @returns whether any statement in that body writes this name, unresolved counting as yes.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * bindingAssignedWithin({ project, body, node: base });
 * ```
