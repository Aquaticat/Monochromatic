/**

/**
 * Members a read-only `DataView` would carry, by name.
 *
 * `collectionStructureClaim` derives "this member restructures its receiver" by diffing an
 * interface against its `Readonly` counterpart: `Array` has `push` and `ReadonlyArray` does
 * not, so `push` mutates. The derivation needs a pair, and the default library declares no
 * `ReadonlyDataView`, so every `DataView` member answered "unrecognized" and every buffer
 * write landed on the opaque boundary. Measured before this existed: 21 findings across the
 * workspace named a buffer member, 14 named nothing else, and `writeEndOfCentralDirectory`
 * in `package/module/zip-writer/src/serialize.ts` carried a `ForeignBorrowed` marker and a
 * hand-written `@mutates view` for what is a specification-defined store.
 *
 * Declaring the missing view rather than listing the mutators is deliberate. It reuses the
 * existing derivation unchanged instead of adding a second one that could disagree with it,
 * and it states the fact in the same shape the library states it for every paired interface.
 *
 * The reading members only, including the `Big` pair a later library file adds. Every `set`
 * member is absent, which is what makes them mutate.
 * `buffer`, `byteLength` and `byteOffset` are present because reading them changes nothing;
 * `buffer` hands out the underlying `ArrayBuffer`, which is an exposure question the result
 * relations answer and not a restructuring of the view.
 *
 * Enforced by `effect-unpaired-view.unit.test.ts`, which drives a real `DataView` and proves
 * each absent member changes what a present one returns, and that each present member does
 * not. An entry added without that probe is a defect by the same standard the other
 * authorities are held to.

/**
 * Members a read-only `Date` would carry, by name.
 *
 * `Date` is unpaired for the same reason `DataView` is: the default library declares no
 * `ReadonlyDate`, so the diff had nothing to compare and every member answered
 * `COLLECTION_UNRECOGNIZED`. Measured before this existed, on the real
 * `package/module/toml-edit/src/values.ts`: `encodeValue` and the three callables around
 * it all read `opaque=[0]`, and 48 workspace findings named `input.toISOString` as the
 * sole remaining cause once `Object.getPrototypeOf` was discharged.
 *
 * A `Date` instance has one mutable specification slot, `[[DateValue]]`, and the fifteen
 * declared setters write it. Everything here leaves it alone, which is what makes the
 * membership derivable rather than asserted.
 *
 * Three names the engine provides are deliberately absent, and their absence claims
 * nothing: `getYear`, `setYear` and `toGMTString` are Annex B members TypeScript never
 * declares, so no lookup can reach this table for them. `getVarDate` is declared, but
 * only by `lib.scripthost.d.ts`, which `package/config/typescript/tsconfig.options.json`
 * never includes and no engine here provides; an entry for it could not be probed, and an
 * unprobed entry is the one thing this design refuses. `[Symbol.toPrimitive]` is declared
 * and preserving, and is still absent, because `collectionStructureClaim` rejects a
 * computed member name before consulting this table: it stays unrecognized rather than
 * being claimed to mutate.
 *
 * `toJSON`, `toLocaleString`, `toLocaleDateString` and `toLocaleTimeString` belong here.
 * Each preserves its receiver, which is the only question this table answers. That they
 * dispatch to receiver-selected code is a channel question, and the channel authority
 * answers it separately by listing none of them.
 *
 * Enforced by `effect-unpaired-view.unit.test.ts`, which drives a real `Date` and proves
 * every declared member leaves both `[[DateValue]]` and the receiver's own properties
 * unchanged, and every absent one changes the timestamp under at least one argument.
