/**
 * Per-parameter facts every readonly verdict is decided from.

 * Proving foreign ownership walks the complete backwards caller closure of the whole configured
 * scope, and whether that answer can change anything is a fact about the callable's parameters
 * rather than about one of them. Building every parameter's facts first lets the callable ask at
 * most once, before it has reported anything, so a proof that exhausts the analysis budget fails a
 * callable that has said nothing rather than one that has already reported half its parameters.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the rule context. These are facts about source and semantics only, which is
 * what makes them safe to compute for a parameter that turns out to need no report at all.
