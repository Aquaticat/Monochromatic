/**
 * Bindings that can hold state reachable from one tracked call result.
 *
 * Split from `effect-result-escape.ts`, which collected only the identifier a call
 * directly initializes while its own doc claimed holders "directly or by alias". One
 * alias hop defeated it, and the discharge that rests on it produced an offer the rule's
 * own fixer applies, that type-checks, and that rewrites the caller's state at runtime.
 * The measurement is in `doc/planning/prefer-readonly-return-substitution.md`, section
 * "A false offer on the structural path".
 *
 * The closure is call-specific on purpose. Deriving it from `bindingOriginBySymbolId`
 * would make `const first = rows.at(0,)` and `const second = rows.at(1,)` share a verdict,
 * because they share a `rows` origin while holding results of different calls.
 *
 * It is flow-insensitive, which is a deliberate over-approximation rather than an
 * oversight. A binding reassigned away from the result stays a holder, and a transfer
 * written before the one that establishes its source still propagates. Both directions
 * only add holders, and adding a holder can only keep opacity, so the imprecision costs
 * offers rather than soundness.
