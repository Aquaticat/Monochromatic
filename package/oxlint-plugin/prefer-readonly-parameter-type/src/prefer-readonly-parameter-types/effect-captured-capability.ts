/**
 * Caller opacity for a callable handed to a callee that could not account for it.
 *
 * The admission gate is the callee's own uncertainty about the formal, not the reason for it.
 * Gating on retention provenance was considered and rejected as unsound: absent retention
 * provenance means call-caused or unknown rather than proven non-retaining, so a callee
 * forwarding its callback to something this analysis cannot resolve would pass the gate while
 * the unresolved callee kept the callable and invoked it later.
 *
 * ```ts
 * function relay(callback: () => Row,): void {
 *   unresolved(callback,);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * `relay` records call-caused opacity for its formal and no retention, and a caller handing it
 * a capturing closure has to withhold all the same.
 *
 * The provenance the caller receives is the callee's own, copied unchanged, which is what
 * makes the two cases read differently at the boundary without a second decision here. A
 * capture reaching a callee that stored it arrives with store provenance and stays silent,
 * because a reader cannot act on it. One reaching a callee that could not inspect its own
 * callee arrives with that call named, which is exactly what the reader can act on.
