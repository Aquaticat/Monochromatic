 * Classify a resolved declaration's effect on its receiver's structure.
 *
 * Two cases are derivable, both from upstream's own declarations. A member of a
 * `Readonly*` view preserves structure by definition, since the view exists to
 * name the operations available to a holder that may not mutate. A member of a
 * mutable collection preserves structure when the paired view declares the same
 * name, and restructures the receiver when it does not: TypeScript builds each
 * view by removing exactly the mutators, so the difference between the two
 * interfaces is upstream's own mutator list.
 *
 * Measured against TypeScript 7.0.2, that difference is `add`, `clear` and
 * `delete` for `Set`; `clear`, `delete`, `getOrInsert`, `getOrInsertComputed`
 * and `set` for `Map`; and `copyWithin`, `fill`, `pop`, `push`, `reverse`,
 * `shift`, `sort`, `splice` and `unshift` for `Array`. No view declares a member
 * its mutable interface lacks, so the partition is exact in both directions.
 *
 * A collection with no paired view, `WeakMap`, `WeakSet`, a typed array, or any
 * host interface, is unrecognized and keeps failing closed.
 *
 * This answers only what happens to the receiver's structure. What user code the
 * member can run remains a separate obligation for the caller.
 *
 * @param project - TypeScript project proving default-library ownership.
 *
 * @param declaration - Selected callable declaration.

 * @returns structural claim derivable for declaration.

 * ```typescript
 * collectionStructureClaim({ project, declaration }) === COLLECTION_STRUCTURE_MUTATED;

 * discharges the reachable-user-code claim about the receiver, and nothing else:
 * the structural claim keeps deriving from the paired read-only view, so a verified
 * mutator such as `Set.add` still reports its mutation.
 *
 * Both verified channels answer the same way here. An internal-slot member reaches
 * no user code at all, and an own-index member reaches only what `values[0]`
 * already reaches, which this rule treats as a pure read everywhere else. Keeping
 * them distinct in the authority is about what each probe must prove, not about
 * what either discharges.
 *
 * A member that invokes a caller-supplied observer is refused here whatever its
 * ambient channel is, and that refusal is the invariant rather than an accident of
 * which members the table currently lists. The ambient half and the observer half
 * are separate obligations: `filter` reaches own-index access and default species,
 * both trusted under the stated baseline, and it also runs whatever predicate the
 * caller passed. Only `recordReadonlyViewApplications` can answer the second half,
 * by resolving that predicate to owned source. Discharging on the first half alone
 * would accept `rows.filter(foreignMutatingPredicate)`, whose predicate received
