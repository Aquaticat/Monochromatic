 * might be, including inside a selector. When the hop lived only in the first, the two could

 * over-attributing direction and deliberate: a reassigned local keeps answering for the
 * container it was declared with, which costs precision and never an offer.

 * follow" for a parameter and for a reassignable local alike, and those need opposite
 * treatment in a walk proving absence: a parameter is the ownership-bearing node the walk
 * exists to classify, while a reassignable local names a value that may not be the one it
 * was declared with. A hop that merged them would stop at both and then classify both,
 * which is the unsound half restated rather than fixed.
 *
 * `let held = owned; held = foreign; return held.filter(keep,);` is the program. Its type is
