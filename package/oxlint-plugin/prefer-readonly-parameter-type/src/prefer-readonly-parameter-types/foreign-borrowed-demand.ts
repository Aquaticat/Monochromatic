 * Whether any indexed source names an ownership marker at all.

 * The complete backwards closure walks exactly these sources, so a scope naming no marker was
 * taken to yield no foreign parameter for any callable, which makes the skip look like an
 * equivalence. It matters because the closure otherwise runs once per callable whose verdict
 * demands it, and most packages name no marker.
 *
 * It is not quite the equivalence its original comment claimed, in one way recorded in
 * `doc/planning/prefer-readonly-foreign-proof-cost.md`: a markerless recursive component can
 * produce a candidate, so a scope naming a marker somewhere can withhold an offer this skip emits.
 * The skip is the more correct of the two answers there, since nothing is marked in either case,
 * and `foreign-borrowed-grounding.ts` closes the gap from the other side.
 *
 * The tempting second objection is that this is a syntactic test over source text while the
 * classifiers inspect checker types, so a marker applied through inference in a file that spells
 * nothing would be missed. It does not reach: `isForeignBorrowedType` only recognizes an alias
 * whose declaration sits at a path ending `/ownership-marker/foreign-borrowed/src/index.ts`, and
 * that file has no `node_modules` segment, so `indexedSourceFileMap` always admits it and its own
 * text always names the marker. Measured, not argued: the same marker moved to `index.d.ts` proves
 * nothing foreign at all, because the identity check rejects it before ownership is ever inferred.
 * `effect-summaries.unit.test.ts` pins that, since relaxing the identity check to accept a
 * declaration file is exactly what would make this skip unsound.
