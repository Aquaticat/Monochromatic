/**
 * Tests whether every type this call's receiver is instantiated over is primitive.
 *
 * Asked for the one channel that is narrow conditionally. A member coercing what it read
 * reaches user code exactly when an element can supply a `toString` or a `valueOf`.
 *
 * Strictly primitive rather than "carries no mutable state", and the difference is the whole
 * correctness of this. `{ readonly label: string; }` carries nothing writable and is still an
 * object, so coercing it reaches whatever `toString` the runtime value actually has.
 * `elementCoercionEffect` in `readonly-member-channel-invalid.ts` is the fixture that says so,
 * and it caught the looser reading immediately. `receiverElementsArePrimitive` in
 * `effect-primitive-origin.ts` does not express this either, for the same reason.
 *
 * Fails closed on every unresolved step, which is the opposite direction from most neighbours
 * and is deliberate: this answer grants a discharge, so not knowing must withhold it.
 *
 * @param checker - TypeScript checker resolving the receiver's type arguments.
