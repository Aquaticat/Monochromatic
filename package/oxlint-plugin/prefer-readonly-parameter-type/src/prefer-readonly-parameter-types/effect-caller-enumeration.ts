/**
 * Tests whether a callable can be reached from outside the enumerated program.
 *
 * The completeness question `getSignatureUsage` does not answer. That query reports every
 * reference TypeScript can find, and both consumers of it used to read "every reference found
 * resolves" as "every caller is accounted for". Those differ exactly when references exist
 * that the query cannot find, and a module export is how that happens:
 *
 * ```ts
 * export function copyRows(rows: Row[],): Row[] {
 *   return rows.slice();
 * }
 *
 * void copyRows([],);
 * ```
 *
 * The in-program call makes the enumeration non-empty and resolvable, so requiring a caller
 * does not close it. A consumer outside this program then writes `copyRows(rows,)[0].value = 1`
 * with nothing attributing the write.
 *
 * Module export is a deliberate over-approximation of "reachable from outside". A callable
 * exported only to another file inside this same program is refused too, though its callers
 * are in fact all enumerable. Refusing it costs precision; admitting the published case costs
 * soundness, and only one of those directions produces a wrong read-only offer.
 *
 * A source file with no module symbol is a script rather than a module, and nothing can import
 * from it, so its callables are enumerable.
 *
 * @param project - TypeScript project resolving module exports.
 *
 * @param declaration - Callable whose reachability is in question.
 *
 * @returns whether every caller of this callable is one this program can enumerate.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * callersAreEnumerable({ project, declaration });
 * ```
