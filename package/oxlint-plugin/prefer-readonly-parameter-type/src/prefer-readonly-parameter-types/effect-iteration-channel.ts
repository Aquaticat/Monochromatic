/**
 * Tests whether draining this value reaches an iterator declared outside the default library.
 *
 * Draining is a call. The accepted trust baseline covers the standard iterator for a value typed
 * as a collection view, recorded in `doc/decision/prefer-readonly-member-channel-authority.md`,
 * and nothing checked that a given iterator was the standard one. A class whose own
 * `[Symbol.iterator]` writes the object it belongs to therefore ran, mutated caller-owned state,
 * and left the parameter offerable.
 *
 * Asked of the member rather than of the receiver's type, because those disagree exactly where it
 * matters: a class implementing `Iterable` declares its own, and a class extending `Array`
 * inherits the library's, so whose file declares the member answers for both without enumerating
 * either.
 *
 * Answers "no" wherever the member cannot be found or resolved. That is deliberate: charging an
 * unresolved iterator instead moves five pinned cases, including a primitive iteration target and
 * a spread whose fallback type resolves to nothing.
 *
 * @param project - TypeScript project resolving types and declaration files.
 *
 * @param node - Expression a `for...of` or spread drains.
 *
 * @returns whether draining may reach code outside the default library.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * iterationOpensUserCode({ project, node: statement.expression });
 * ```
