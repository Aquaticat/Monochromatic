 * Globs naming test-only modules that are not package behavior.
 *
 * Every entry must identify test-only code by name alone, because a match has
 * two consequences: the module is exempt as an import target, and the module is
 * itself inspected. A glob that also catches package behavior therefore fails
 * twice over, exempting real behavior from tests while reporting ordinary
 * source for importing its own siblings.
 *
 * The three literal `test-` names are listed individually rather than as a
 * `test-*` prefix glob, which would also match real package behavior such as
 * `package/cli/mutation-test/src/container/test-run.ts` and silently exempt it.
 *
 * `*-helpers.ts` and `*-harness.ts` are deliberately absent. Measured across
 * this repository, all 22 files carrying those suffixes are imported by
 * package behavior (`cli-helpers.ts` by `cli.ts`, `render-helpers.ts` by four
 * i18n modules, `tasks-helpers.ts` by three database modules) and none are
 * test-only. The suffix describes what a module does, not who may load it.
