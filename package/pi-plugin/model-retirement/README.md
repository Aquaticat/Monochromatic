# pi-plugin-model-retirement

Pi extension that retires superseded models from the live catalog.

At every session start it reads pi's model registry, decides which entries a newer
sibling in the same family supersedes, and re-registers the affected providers without
those entries.
The model picker then stops offering them and `ModelRegistry.find` stops resolving them.

Design, measurements, and every rejected alternative:
[`doc/planning/pi-model-retirement.md`](../../../doc/planning/pi-model-retirement.md).

## What it does

- Reads chat models through `ModelRegistry.getAll()` and image and classifier models
  through `getModelsOfType`, because `getAll()` reports chat models only.
- Groups entries into families by provider, API, and name shape, then keeps the newest
  member of each family and retires the rest.
- Filters a provider only when it loses at least one model, and picks a mechanism per
  provider.
- Merges a configuration where pi exposes one, carrying every kept model of all three
  types plus all of its metadata: `contextWindow`, `maxTokens`, `reasoning`,
  `thinkingLevelMap`, `promptCache`, `compat`, `samplingParams`, and `inputLimits`. Pi
  merges defined values over the previous registration, so that owner's `apiKey`,
  `oauth`, and `streamSimple` survive.
- Wraps the composed provider object otherwise, replacing only its model listing. That
  needs no endpoint metadata, loses no model field, keeps per-model `headers`, and
  filters live, so a catalog refresh mid-session is filtered on the next read.
- Logs one summary line per session, one debug line per retirement, and one warning per
  provider it could not filter.
- Warns when the session started on a model this pass retired, naming the successor.

## What it does not do

- It does not touch pi settings. Neither `enabledModels` nor `defaultModel` is read or
  written.
- It does not switch the session's model. A session that started on a retired model
  keeps running on it, and the warning is the only signal.
- It does not change `pi --list-models`. That command fires no extension event, so it
  lists the unfiltered catalog. The shrunk picker is the visible effect.
- It offers no override. There is no allowlist, no environment variable, and no runtime
  escape hatch. Restoring a retired model means editing this package or removing it from
  your settings.
- It does not remove whole providers. `unregisterProvider` is never called.

## Retirement rule

An id is split into tokens on every character that is not a digit, a lower-case letter,
or a dot. A token is version evidence only when its digits run to the end, optionally
behind a `v` and optionally behind an alphabetic prefix:

- `5.2`, `v4`, and `0813` are version tokens.
- `qwen3.8` splits into the word `qwen` and the version `3.8`, so `qwen3.7-flash` and
  `qwen3.8-flash` are one family and the older one retires.
- `70b`, `a12b`, `2.4t`, and `4o` stay single words, so parameter sizes and glued names
  never order two models against each other.

Everything that is not a version token joins the family's name shape, which is why
tiers stay separate: `glm-5.3-flash` is never retired by `glm-5.3`.

Inside a family, version vectors are compared component by component. Three extra rules
handle the shapes that plain numeric comparison gets wrong:

1. Components whose raw digit lengths differ by two or more belong to different
   numbering schemes, so the pair is left unordered. That keeps `qwen3.5-plus-02-15`
   alive beside `qwen3.5-plus-20260420`.
2. When one vector continues the other, all-date extras mean a pinned snapshot, which
   loses to the rolling alias, and all-version extras mean a point release, which beats
   its own base version. That retires `deepseek-v4-pro-0813` in favor of
   `deepseek-v4-pro`, and retires `claude-opus-5` in favor of `claude-opus-5-5`.
3. A mix of date and version extras is left unordered.

An entry with no version token at all is never retired, which protects rolling aliases
and routing targets such as `openai/gpt-4o`, `auto`, and `syn:large:text`.

Anything the rule cannot order, it leaves alone. Abstention is deliberate: with no
runtime override, a wrong retirement is only fixable by rebuilding, while a missed one
costs a single row in the picker.

Measured over pi-ai's bundled catalog of 1604 entries: 551 retirements, 29 abstentions,
and no retirement whose keeper is not strictly newer.

## How each provider is filtered

Pi offers two ways to change a provider's models, and the planner picks per provider.

Where `getRegisteredProviderConfig` returns a configuration, the pass registers a
configuration: pi merges defined values over the previous registration, so the owner's
`apiKey`, `oauth`, and `streamSimple` survive, and the filtered list carries every kept
model of all three types because `getAll()` reports chat models only.

Everywhere else the pass wraps the composed provider from `getProvider` and registers the
wrapper, which spreads the original object and replaces only `getModels` and
`getAllModels`. That covers providers another extension registered as native objects, whose
configuration pi will not return, and builtins whose models carry no `baseUrl`, which a
configuration registration cannot re-declare because pi throws.

A provider is skipped only when pi exposes neither a configuration nor a composed provider
for it. Measured in the real host: no provider is skipped, and all 39 providers with
retirements are filtered.

Per-model `headers` survive the wrapper path, which passes model objects through by
reference. The configuration path loses them, because pi's `extensionModelFromDefinition`
sets `headers` to `undefined` for all three model types; in the bundled catalog only
`github-copilot` (34 models) and `nvidia` (19) carry per-model headers, and neither is in
the live set on this machine.

## Logging

Every record is tagged `pi-model-retirement`, then re-tagged with the handler name.

- `info`: one summary line per pass, for example
  `retired 515 models across 33 providers; declined keeperAmbiguity=14 unorderedPair=15 versionlessProtected=6`.
- `debug`: one line per retirement, for example
  `retired hyper/glm-5.2 in favor of glm-5.3`.
- `warn`: one line per skipped or refused provider, and one line when the session is
  running on a retired model.

There is no audit task. The session log and the pinned characterization fixture are the
only two surfaces for the retirement table.

## Installation

Installed into global pi settings on 2026-10-02: the `packages` array went from 17 entries
to 18, the new entry was appended last, no existing entry was removed, and no other setting
changed.

One pass in the real host after installation: chat models 1677 to 1080, 597 retirements
across all 39 providers with retirements, no provider skipped, image 57 and classifier 15
unchanged, `azure-openai-responses` filtered through the wrapper path, `radius` keeping its
`streamSimple` handler, `synthetic` keeping its credentials, and no `extension_error` record
from pi.

Build the package, then install it by its repository path:

```bash
mise run //package/pi-plugin/model-retirement:build
pi install /var/home/user/Monochromatic/package/pi-plugin/model-retirement
```

Global settings only. Do not add it to a project `.pi/settings.json`, and do not pass
`--local`.

Pi records a local path relative to your home directory, so the stored entry reads
`../../../../var/home/user/Monochromatic/package/pi-plugin/model-retirement`. That is
normal and resolves correctly; `openai-fast` is stored the same way. Removal accepts the
absolute path even though the stored entry is relative:

```bash
pi remove /var/home/user/Monochromatic/package/pi-plugin/model-retirement
```

Install it last in the `packages` array. By `session_start` every provider package has
already registered, so ordering only matters against an extension that registers
providers from a later event handler.

If you script the install, snapshot `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` before and after and fail
on any change outside the `packages` array, the way
`package/pi-plugin/openai-fast/mise.toml` guards its `install:global` task.

## Tasks

- `build`, `build:js`, `build:js:node`, `watch:build`, `watch:build:js`,
  `watch:build:js:node`: rolldown builds.
- `lint`, `lint:types`, `lint:oxlint`, `format:oxlint`: checks and formatting.
- `test:unit`: unit and characterization tests, which depend on `build` because they
  import the shipped bundle.
- `verify:extension`: boots the built artifact against a fake host and asserts the
  registration contract.
- `verify:host`: boots a real disposable pi host and asserts what filtering did to a
  live catalog. Gated by `PI_MODEL_RETIREMENT_VERIFY_HOST=1`, which the task sets.
- `fixture:retirement-table`: regenerates the pinned retirement table from the
  installed pi-ai catalog.

## Verification

`verify:host` runs pi in RPC mode inside a throwaway home whose only content is a
`models.json` carrying one context-window override, with no credentials and no other
extension loaded. A probe extension loads before the built one and snapshots the
registry at `session_start`, before filtering, and at `resources_discover`, after it.
The run asserts that the chat catalog shrank, that a retired id disappeared, that the
family winner survived, that the `models.json` override still reports 750000 rather
than the bundled 272000, that thinking levels survived, that image and classifier
counts did not move, that a provider whose models carry no `baseUrl` was filtered
through the wrapper path while keeping its own family winner, and that no provider was
skipped. Fourteen assertions in total.
The same probe, run against the real agent directory, is what reported the incumbent
configuration key counts before and after filtering.

`retirement-table.characterization.unit.test.ts` pins the full retirement table over
the bundled catalog. A pi upgrade that changes any single retirement fails that test
until the diff is reviewed and the fixture is regenerated with
`mise run //package/pi-plugin/model-retirement:fixture:retirement-table`.

## Limits

- Pi's extension API carries no stability guarantee, and its changelog records 59
  breaking changes. The characterization suite and both verification tasks exist to
  catch that early.
- The wrapper path filters live, so a catalog refresh mid-session is filtered on the next
  read. The configuration path filters a snapshot, so a refresh can reintroduce retired
  models there until the next session start. Pi exposes no model-changed event either way.
- Filtering happens after pi chooses the startup model, so a session can begin on a
  retired model. Today's configured default survives the rule; the exposure begins when
  a default drifts onto a retired id.
