/**
 Translation from a live registry read into per-provider filtering plans.

 Two mechanisms are available and the planner picks per provider. A provider another
 extension registered through a configuration is re-registered as a configuration, because
 pi merges defined values over the previous registration and so preserves that owner's
 `apiKey`, `oauth`, and `streamSimple`. Any other provider, meaning a native registration
 or a builtin, is wrapped instead: its composed `Provider` object is spread and only its
 model listing methods are replaced, which needs no endpoint metadata and loses no model
 field.

 `ModelRegistry.getAll()` reports chat models only, which is why image and classifier
 models are read separately and passed through untouched on the configuration path.
