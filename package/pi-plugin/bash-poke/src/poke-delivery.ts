/**
 Sends one finished job's poke as a custom message that triggers a turn.
 
 A custom message rather than a user message keeps the transcript honest: Pi
 renders it through this package's renderer instead of showing text that looks
 typed. Turn scheduling is the same, immediate when idle and queued behind
 current work otherwise.

 ```ts
 deliverPoke({ pi, content: '[bash finished]', details, },);
