/**
 Pi extension that runs `!` commands in the background and pokes the model when they finish.

 Native `!` blocks the editor until a command exits and refuses a second command
 while one runs. This extension takes execution over through Pi's `user_bash`
 event, hands the editor back immediately with a placeholder recorded in context,
 and sends the model a poke carrying the real output when the process exits. The
 motivating case is `! sleep 7200` as a delayed continue after a provider usage
 limit resets, which needs the poke and does not need the extension to know
 anything about limits.

 Loads settings, resolves the shell, and registers bash-poke.
 
 Both happen before registration because every handler closes over them, and Pi
 awaits an async factory before emitting `session_start`. A settings file that
 exists but cannot be honored fails the load loudly rather than degrading
 silently, since a knob that does nothing is worse than an error.
