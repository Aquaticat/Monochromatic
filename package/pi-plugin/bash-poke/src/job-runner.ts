/**
 Starts one command in the background and returns its handles.
 
 The child leads its own process group so cancellation can reach everything the
 command spawned, which is what makes a package-manager build cancellable
 rather than merely interruptible. Output is bounded in memory by the recorder
 and spooled in full to disk, with stream backpressure pausing the child when
 the disk falls behind.
 
 @param command - command line to run
 
 @param cwd - working directory
 
 @param shell - resolved shell invocation
 
 @param headChars - characters kept from the start of output
 
 @param tailChars - characters kept from the end of output
 
 @param killGraceMs - milliseconds between SIGTERM and SIGKILL on cancel
 
 @param tmp - temp root for the spool file
 
 @param onChunk - notified after each output chunk
 
 @param now - clock used for the start timestamp
 
 @returns running job handles
 
 @example
 ```ts
 const job = await startJob({
   command: 'printf hello',

   headChars: 2000,
