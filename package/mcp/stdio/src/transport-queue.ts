/**
 * Creates a queue that serializes execution and output for one stdio connection.
 *
 * The read loop calls {@link SerialRequestQueue.enqueue} and moves on, so a tool running
 * for half an hour no longer stops the server from reading `notifications/cancelled`.
 * Execution itself stays strictly serial: exactly one producer runs at a time, which is
 * what the transport did before by accident and now does by design, so no two tool
 * handlers can interleave against a shared backend.
 *
 * Cancellation follows the revision 2026-07-28 schema, which states a cancellation
 * "MAY arrive after the request has already finished" and that "the result will be
 * unused, so any associated processing SHOULD cease". An entry cancelled before it runs
 * is dropped without ever being produced; one cancelled while running is allowed to
 * finish, because aborting a half-created VM is worse than completing it, and its frame
 * is discarded unwritten. A cancellation naming an unknown or already-settled id is
 * ignored.
 *
 * @param write - Sink for one serialized frame, awaited before the next entry runs
 *
 * @returns Queue owning execution order, cancellation, and write order
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const queue = createSerialRequestQueue({
 *   write: async function writeFrame(frame) {
