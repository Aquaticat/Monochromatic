# claude-code-plugin-terminal-title

Claude Code hook that sets the terminal tab title to reflect current activity.

## What it shows

Tool titles use lifecycle verbs:
present-tense wording during `PreToolUse`,
past-tense wording after `PostToolUse`.

Examples:

- `Bash`: `✳ Running git status` while running,
  `✳ Ran git status` after completion.
- `Read`: `✳ Reading src/index.ts` while running,
  `✳ Read src/index.ts` after completion.
- `Edit`: `✳ Editing src/config.ts` while running,
  `✳ Edited src/config.ts` after completion.
- `Write`: `✳ Writing dist/output.ts` while running,
  `✳ Wrote dist/output.ts` after completion.
- `Grep`: `✳ Searching for TODO` while running,
  `✳ Searched for TODO` after completion.
- `Glob`: `✳ Finding *.ts` while running,
  `✳ Found *.ts` after completion.
- `Agent`: `✳ Running agent find endpoints` while running,
  `✳ Finished agent find endpoints` after completion.
- `WebSearch`: `✳ Searching web for react hooks` while running,
  `✳ Searched web for react hooks` after completion.
- `WebFetch`: `✳ Fetching example.com` while running,
  `✳ Fetched example.com` after completion.
- `AskUserQuestion`: `✳ Asking: Which library?` while running,
  `✳ Asked: Which library?` after completion.
- `TaskList`: `✳ Listing tasks` while running,
  `✳ Listed tasks` after completion.
- Unknown and MCP tools: `✳ Running mcp__weather` while running,
  `✳ Ran mcp__weather` after completion.

## Session and lifecycle examples

- `PermissionRequest`: `✳ Requesting permission: Bash`
- `PostToolUseFailure`: `✳ Failed tool: Bash`
- `SessionStart`: `✳ Started session: startup`
- `SessionEnd`: `✳ Ended session`
- `InstructionsLoaded`: `✳ Loaded instructions: CLAUDE.md`
- `UserPromptSubmit`: `✳ Received prompt: Fix the auth bug`
- `Stop`: `✳ Stopped agent`
- `SubagentStart`: `✳ Starting subagent: Explore`
- `SubagentStop`: `✳ Finished subagent: Explore`
- `TeammateIdle`: `✳ Marked idle: reviewer`
- `TaskCompleted`: `✳ Completed task: Fix login bug`
- `Notification`: `✳ Notified: Permission granted`
- `ConfigChange`: `✳ Updated config: project_settings`
- `WorktreeCreate`: `✳ Created worktree: bold-oak-a3f2`
- `WorktreeRemove`: `✳ Removed worktree`
- `PreCompact`: `✳ Compacting: auto`

## Terminal compatibility

Works with any terminal that supports OSC 0 title sequences:
Ptyxis,
Konsole,
Wezterm,
Ghostty,
iTerm2,
kitty,
and others.

## How it works

The hook receives JSON on stdin from Claude Code,
extracts a descriptive summary based on the event and its input,
replaces OSC-breaking controls with visible tokens,
byte-caps the final title payload below Ghostty's 256-byte UTF-8 title reject threshold,
and writes `\x1b]0;title\x07` directly to `/dev/tty`.

Hooks run outside the sandbox,
so `/dev/tty` is accessible.

## Setup

Install the package to your workspace root,
which makes the `cctt` bin available.
Then add the hook to `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```jsonc
// .claude/settings.local.json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [{ "type": "command", "command": "cctt" }],
    "InstructionsLoaded": [{ "type": "command", "command": "cctt" }],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [{ "type": "command", "command": "cctt" }],
    "PreToolUse": [{ "type": "command", "command": "cctt" }],
    "PermissionRequest": [{ "type": "command", "command": "cctt" }],
    "PostToolUse": [{ "type": "command", "command": "cctt" }],
    "PostToolUseFailure": [{ "type": "command", "command": "cctt" }],
    "Notification": [{ "type": "command", "command": "cctt" }],
    "SubagentStart": [{ "type": "command", "command": "cctt" }],
    "SubagentStop": [{ "type": "command", "command": "cctt" }],
    "Stop": [{ "type": "command", "command": "cctt" }],
    "TeammateIdle": [{ "type": "command", "command": "cctt" }],
    "TaskCompleted": [{ "type": "command", "command": "cctt" }],
    "ConfigChange": [{ "type": "command", "command": "cctt" }],
    "WorktreeCreate": [{ "type": "command", "command": "cctt" }],
    "WorktreeRemove": [{ "type": "command", "command": "cctt" }],
    "PreCompact": [{ "type": "command", "command": "cctt" }],
    "SessionEnd": [{ "type": "command", "command": "cctt" }]
  }
}
```
