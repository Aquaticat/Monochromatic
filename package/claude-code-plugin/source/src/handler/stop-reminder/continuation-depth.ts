/**
 * Depth guard for forced continuation.
 *
 * Claude Code has its own cap, `CLAUDE_CODE_STOP_HOOK_BLOCK_CAP`, present in
 * the 2.1.224 binary. It does not make this guard redundant, because it does
 * not bound the expensive case. Runs whose agent produced no tool calls were
 * overridden after nine consecutive blocks, while a run whose agent ran one
 * shell command per continuation reached thirty-one and was never overridden.
 * The platform cap therefore catches an idle loop and not a busy one, which is
 * the loop that costs real money.
 *
 * The guard counts how many forced continuations have already happened since
 * the last human turn and allows the stop once that reaches the limit. Counting
 * comes from the transcript rather than a sidecar so there is no state to
 * corrupt, no cleanup to miss, and resuming a session cannot lose the count.
