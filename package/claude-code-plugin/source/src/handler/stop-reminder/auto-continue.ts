/**
 Unconditional stop-blocking detector.
 
 The hedging, dismissal, and trailing-question detectors all answer "is this
 response defective?". This one answers a different question: "did the agent
 stop while work remained?", and it answers it without consulting the response
 text at all.
 
 The distinction matters because every text-conditioned rule can be satisfied
 by changing the text. A rule keyed on the phrase `Next:` is satisfied by
 deleting that sentence, which converts an informative stop into a silent one.
 This detector cannot be satisfied that way because it reads nothing.
 
 Termination is shared. Claude Code caps consecutive blocks through
 `CLAUDE_CODE_STOP_HOOK_BLOCK_CAP`, but only reliably when the agent is idle:
 runs producing no tool calls were overridden after nine blocks, while a run
 working on every continuation reached thirty-one unchecked. This repository
 bounds the busy case in `continuation-depth.ts` and releases the pointless
 cases in `continuation-progress.ts` and `continuation-tasks.ts`. See
 `doc/troubleshooting/claude-code-opus-5-premature-turn-end.md`.

/**
 Reminder lines emitted when a stop is refused.
 
 Phrased as "you stopped while work remained" rather than "you used a
 forbidden phrase", because naming a phrase teaches suppression of the phrase.
 The instruction to keep status prose exists for the same reason: the failure
 this guard targets is announcing work instead of doing it, and a silent stop
 is strictly worse than an announced one.
 
 The `AskUserQuestion` route matters because it is the only exit that actually
 gets the agent what a stop was reaching for. That tool waits for the user's
 answer, so an agent genuinely blocked on a decision can pause without ending
 its turn, and the hook has nothing to refuse. Stopping, by contrast, ends the
 work and waits to be restarted by hand, which is the cost this whole
 mechanism exists to remove.
 
 @returns reminder lines, joined by callers into one block reason
 
 @example
 ```ts
 autoContinueReason().join(' ');
 ```
