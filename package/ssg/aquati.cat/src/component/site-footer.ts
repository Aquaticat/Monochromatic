/**
 Site footer with rolling newsticker.

 Colocates the CSS animation, keyframe generation, ticker quotes,
 and HTML template in a single `<site-footer>` custom element.

 All quotes share one CSS grid cell, so the footer's block size is the
 tallest quote's wrapped height at whatever inline size the footer happens
 to have. That makes the visible slot self-sizing: no breakpoint declares
 how many lines a quote takes, and a quote that wraps to three lines on a
 narrow screen is shown in full rather than clipped after its first line.

 Each quote animates through that one slot on a shared keyframe timeline,
 offset by a per-quote `animation-delay`. A `random()` seed shifts every
 delay by a whole number of quotes, so a different quote greets each visit.
