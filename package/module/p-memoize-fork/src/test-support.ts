/**
 Test-only helpers shared by this package's unit tests.
 
 Deferreds and gates make call timing deterministic: each wrapped call
 blocks on its own gate and the test releases gates in a chosen order, so
 in-flight overlap and settle order are decided by the test instead of by
 scheduler timing. The spy cache records every storage call so tests can
 assert the cache contract, not just its final contents.
