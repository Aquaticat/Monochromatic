/**
 TypeScript fork of `p-map`: map over iterables with limited concurrency.
 
 Derived from [`p-map`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-map) by Sindre
 Sorhus (MIT); see `LICENSES/MIT.txt` and this package's README for the full
 attribution. Scheduling semantics match `p-map` 7.0.8: up to `concurrency`
 mapper calls run at once over a synchronous or asynchronous input, results
 collect in input order, and `stopOnError`, the abort `signal`, and
 `pMapSkip` behave as upstream defines them.

 One concurrent-map run: the inputs to walk, the mapper to run per element,

 The single destructured object replaces upstream `p-map`'s
 `pMap(iterable, mapper, options)` positional parameters, which repository
 lint bans; `options` keeps its shape and destructuring failure semantics.

 @param options - Concurrency bound, `stopOnError` policy, and optional
 abort signal.
 
 @example
 ```ts
 const run: MapRun<number, number> = {
   iterable: [1, 2, 3,],
   mapper: async function double(value: number,): Promise<number> {
     return value * 2;

/* oxlint-disable eslint/require-await -- `pMap` stays `async` so a destructuring failure rejects the caller's promise like upstream `p-map`'s `async` signature, and returning the deferred promise without awaiting it preserves upstream's promise-adoption tick (measured: an `await` here settles the caller one microtask early) */
/**
 Runs one concurrent map over upstream `p-map`'s run structure: option
 destructuring first, then the input, mapper, and concurrency checks in
 upstream's order, then detached per-element runners pulling the source
 under the concurrency bound.
 
 The run body sits in one `try` that funnels synchronous failures into the
 returned promise, mirroring upstream's `new Promise(executor)`: a hostile
 input, mapper, or iterator becomes a rejection at the same point in the
 run's lifetime.
 
 @typeParam Element - element type after awaiting an iterated item
 
 @typeParam NewElement - mapper result type, awaited when thenable
 
 @param iterable - Inputs walked once in iteration order.
 
 @param mapper - Function run per element with its position in the input.
 
 @param options - Concurrency bound, `stopOnError` policy, and optional
 abort signal.
 
 @returns Promise settling with every non-skip mapper result in input order,
 or rejecting with the first mapper failure (`stopOnError`) or an
 `AggregateError` of every failure.
 
 @throws InvalidInputError when the input is neither an `Iterable` nor an
 `AsyncIterable`; rejected through the returned promise like upstream.
 
 @throws MapperRequiredError when the mapper is not a function; rejected
 through the returned promise like upstream.
 
 @throws InvalidConcurrencyError when `concurrency` is not a safe integer
 from 1 and up and not `Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY`; rejected through the
 returned promise like upstream.
