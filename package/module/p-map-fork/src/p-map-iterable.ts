/**
 TypeScript fork of `p-map`'s streaming variant: map over iterables with
 limited concurrency and backpressure, yielding results in order.
 
 Derived from [`p-map`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-map) by Sindre
 Sorhus (MIT); see `LICENSES/MIT.txt` and this package's README for the full
 attribution. Streaming semantics match `p-map` 7.0.8: mapper calls stay
 within `concurrency`,
 resolved-but-unconsumed results stay within
 `backpressure`,
 skips are dropped rather than yielded,
 and mapper failures
 surface as a throw from the async iterator instead of a rejection.

 One streaming-map run: the inputs to walk,

 repository lint bans; `options` keeps its shape and destructuring failure
 semantics.
