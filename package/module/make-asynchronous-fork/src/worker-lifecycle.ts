/**
 Worker lifecycle for the make-asynchronous fork: host detection, worker
 creation on Node.js and browsers, single-flight request tracking, abort
 handling, and reply routing.
 
 Derived from [`make-asynchronous`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/make-asynchronous)
 by Sindre Sorhus (MIT); see `LICENSES/MIT.txt` and this package's README
 for the full attribution. Behavior matches `make-asynchronous` 2.1.0: one
 request in flight per worker, stray messages dropped, worker failures
 remembered and replayed to the pending request, abort delivered as the
 signal's reason, and cleanup terminating the worker exactly once.
