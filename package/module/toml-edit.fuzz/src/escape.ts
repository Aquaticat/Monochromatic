/**
 Independent TOML basic-string escaper for the fuzz generators.
 
 The generators must turn an arbitrary JS string into a valid TOML basic
 string literal so the parser can be asked to decode it back. Reusing the
 package's own emitter would make that test circular (the emitter is itself
 under test), so this module is a deliberately separate, minimal encoder
 verified against the parser in `generators.unit.test.ts`.
 
 It follows the TOML 1.0 basic-string rules: backslash and double quote take
 their short escapes, the named control escapes (`\b \t \n \f \r`) are used
 where they apply, and every other control scalar below U+0020 plus U+007F is
 emitted as a `\uXXXX` sequence. All other scalars, including astral
 characters, pass through verbatim because TOML basic strings accept raw
 Unicode.
