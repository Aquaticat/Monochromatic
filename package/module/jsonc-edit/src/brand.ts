/**
 * Branded type for a complete JSONC document string.
 *
 * The brand is a compile-time marker only; at runtime a `StringJsonc` is an
 * ordinary string. It exists so callers cannot pass an arbitrary string where a
 * value known to be JSONC is required, without an explicit assertion at the
 * boundary. Defined locally rather than derived from the retired `module-es`
 * string taxonomy.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const source = '{ "a": 1 } // ok' as StringJsonc;
 * ```

/**
 * Branded type for a JSONC fragment: a substring of a document being parsed,
 * such as the content remaining after a leading comment is stripped.
 *
 * Distinct brand from {@link StringJsonc} so a fragment is not mistaken for a
 * whole document at a type boundary.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const rest = '[1, 2, 3]' as FragmentStringJsonc;
