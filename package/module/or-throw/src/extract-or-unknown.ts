/**
 * Type-level `Extract` variant that handles `unknown` inputs.
 *
 * @module

/**
 * Variant of `Extract` that returns the target type `U` when the input `T`
 * is `unknown`, instead of collapsing to `never`.
 *
 * Plain `Extract<unknown, string>` evaluates to `never`, because `unknown`
 * does not extend `string`. That defeat is silent: a helper typed as
 * `<T,>(value: T,): Extract<T, string>` returns `never` for the most common
 * call shape (a value of type `unknown` from `JSON.parse`, a fetched API
 * payload, generic property access), forcing callers to write awkward casts
 * or losing the narrowing entirely. `ExtractOrUnknown` recovers `U` in that
 * case while preserving the discriminating behavior of `Extract` for
 * narrower input types.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import type { ExtractOrUnknown, } from '\@monochromatic-dev/module-or-throw';
 *
 * type A = ExtractOrUnknown<unknown, string>;          // string
 * type B = ExtractOrUnknown<string | number, string>;  // string
 * type C = ExtractOrUnknown<string, string>;           // string
 * type D = ExtractOrUnknown<number, string>;           // never
 * ```
