/**
 * Tests for `settleWithin`.
 *
 * The sharp cases are about a LEAKED TIMER, which is the entire reason this
 * exists beside `withTimeout` and `wait`, and they are measured in a CHILD
 * PROCESS rather than in this one.
 *
 * Counting `process.getActiveResourcesInfo()` in-process was tried first and
 * abandoned: it does detect the leak, but this suite shares a process with
 * cases that deliberately leak timers of their own, so the baseline moves
 * underneath the assertion and the result depends on scheduling. The child
 * process measures the property that actually matters and that a reader would
 * recognise: whether a program stops when its work is done.
