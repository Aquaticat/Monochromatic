/**
 * Async timing primitives.
 *
 * - {@link wait}`(ms)`: resolves after a delay; thin wrapper over `setTimeout`.
 * - {@link withTimeout}`({ promise, ms, label })`: races a promise against a
 *   deadline and rejects with a labeled error if the deadline wins.
 * - {@link settleWithin}`({ promise, ms })`: same race, but expiry is an
 *   ordinary outcome returned as a value rather than an error.
 *
 * PICKING BETWEEN THEM. Use `wait` when the delay itself is the point, as in a
 * polling loop that awaits it to completion. Use `withTimeout` when the caller
 * needed the VALUE and not getting it is a failure. Use `settleWithin` when the
 * caller needed the WAIT and expiry is normal.
 *
 * NEVER `Promise.race([work, wait(ms,),],)`. `Promise.race` does nothing to the
 * loser, and `wait` returns no handle, so a won race leaves a live `setTimeout`
 * holding the event loop until it expires. Both other helpers clear their timer
 * through a `using` disposer; that is most of why they exist.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { settleWithin, wait, withTimeout, } from '\@monochromatic-dev/module-async-time';
 *
 * await wait(500,);
 *
 * const data = await withTimeout({
 *   promise: fetch('/api/data',),
 *   ms: 5000,
 *   label: 'fetch user data',
 * },);
 *
 * const finished = await settleWithin({
 *   promise: Promise.allSettled(stragglers,),
 *   ms: 30_000,
 * },);
 * ```
