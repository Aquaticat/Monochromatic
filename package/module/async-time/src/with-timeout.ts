/**
 * Races a promise against a deadline.
 * Resolves with the promise's value if it settles in time;
 * rejects with a labeled `Error` otherwise.
 *
 * Uses `Promise.race` with a `using`-disposed timer so the
 * `setTimeout` handle is cleared whether the race wins or loses.
 *
 * @param promise - promise to race against the timeout
 *
 * @param ms - timeout duration in milliseconds
 *
 * @param label - human-readable label for the timeout error message
 *
 * @returns same value as the input promise when it settles before the timeout
 *
 * @mutates promise - `Promise.race` performs caller-owned promise assimilation through its `then` capability.
 *
 * @throws Error when the timeout expires before the promise settles
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { withTimeout, } from '\@monochromatic-dev/module-async-time';
 *
 * const data = await withTimeout({
 *   promise: fetch(url,),
 *   ms: 5000,
 *   label: 'fetch user data',
 * },);
 * ```
