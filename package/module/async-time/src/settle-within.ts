/**
 * Waits for a promise to settle, or for a deadline, whichever comes first,
 * WITHOUT treating the deadline as an error.
 *
 * The difference from `withTimeout` is the whole reason this exists.
 * `withTimeout` rejects when the deadline wins, which is right when the caller
 * needed the value. This resolves either way, which is right when the caller
 * needed the WAIT: a grace window granted to stragglers, a settle-or-move-on
 * step, anything where expiry is an ordinary outcome rather than a failure.
 * Expressing that with `withTimeout` means catching an error on the expected
 * path and then proving it was the timeout's error and not a real one.
 *
 * WHY NOT `Promise.race([promise, wait(ms,),],)`, which is what this replaces:
 * `Promise.race` settles on the first result and does nothing whatever to the
 * loser. `wait` is a bare `setTimeout` that returns no handle, so when the
 * promise wins the timer is left pending, unclearable, and holding the Node
 * event loop. A process doing that finishes its work and then sits there until
 * the last timer expires. Measured at three minutes on a 180-second grace
 * window, which was long enough to look like a hang and to stall anything
 * chained behind it.
 *
 * @param promise - work to wait on
 *
 * @param ms - longest this will wait
 *
 * @returns Which side finished first, so a caller that cares can tell
 *
 * @mutates promise - `Promise.race` performs caller-owned promise assimilation through its `then` capability.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { settleWithin, } from '\@monochromatic-dev/module-async-time';
 *
 * const finished = await settleWithin({
 *   promise: Promise.allSettled(asks,),
 *   ms: graceMs,
 * },);
 * if (finished === 'expired') l.warn('grace ran out',);
 * ```
