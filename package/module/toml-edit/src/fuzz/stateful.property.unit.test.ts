/**
 * Stateful edit-model property: random `tomlSet` / `tomlDelete` sequences over
 * `emptyTomlEdit`, applied directly to the accumulating state (no reparse
 * between operations), checked against an in-memory nested model.
 *
 * A rejected operation must throw a `TomlEditError` and leave both the state
 * and the model unchanged. A successful scalar set must make the effective read
 * at its path equal the written value; a delete must make it `undefined`. After
 * the whole sequence, `tomlStringify` output must reparse to a document
 * semantically equal to the model.
 *
 * Paths are one to three segments over a tiny alphabet, so implicit dotted-key
 * parents, overwrites, and type changes arise often. Because the document tree
 * is the single source of truth, deltas no longer need to be flushed by a
 * reparse between operations (issue #252).
