 * Draw one dependent arbitrary per input item and collect the results in order.
 *
 * fast-check has no built-in "list of items to arbitrary of results" combinator;
 * folding `chain` keeps each draw independent while preserving input order, and
 * avoids the rest-parameter spread that `tuple(...arbs)` would need.
 *
 * @param items - Inputs to expand, one arbitrary each.
 *
 * @param make - Produces the arbitrary for one item at its index.
 *
 * @returns Arbitrary of the drawn results in `items` order.
 *
 * @mutates make - Invoking caller-supplied factory can change captured or otherwise reachable state.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * drawEach({ items: ['a', 'b',], make: (name,) => keyBlockArbitrary({ owner: name, },), },);
 * ```
