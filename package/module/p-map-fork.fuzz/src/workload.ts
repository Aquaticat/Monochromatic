/**
 Deterministic workload types and failure rendering shared by this
 package's runners and property files.
 
 A workload drives one concurrent map through a mapper adapter: each
 generated call blocks on its own gate, and the runner releases gates one per
 step in a generated order. Everything the mapper does is decided by the
 workload, so two implementations fed the same workload produce directly
 comparable traces.
