/**
 Member attachment pinning upstream `quick-lru`'s class-prototype
 descriptor flags.
 
 Upstream carries every member on its class prototype, where methods are
 writable, non-enumerable, configurable data properties and `size`-family
 members are non-enumerable, configurable accessors. This module copies a
 member table onto the factory's shell with exactly those flags, so the
 fuzz sidecar's surface check can pin the fork against upstream.

/**
 Copies every member of one object onto another with upstream's

 Only `enumerable` changes: a member table written as an object literal
 already carries upstream's writable-or-accessor shape and configurable
 flag, and upstream members are exactly that with `enumerable: false`.
 
 @param options - Shell to attach onto and member table to copy.
 
 @throws Error when a listed member suddenly has no own descriptor, an
 unreachable state for an object literal.

 ```ts
 attachMembers({

     get size(): number {
       return 0;
