// What survives of one auditor's answer once its quotes are checked against the
// texts, deterministically and without asking anybody.
//
// EACH CATEGORY MUST ANCHOR IN THE SIDE IT CAN. Content the candidate never
// rendered has nothing in the candidate to quote, so demanding a candidate span
// for an omission would make omission unfileable, and it is the likeliest
// defect a from-scratch rendering has. An addition nothing supports is the
// mirror. A changed number, actor or polarity is stated by both and anchors in
// both.
//
// THE OBLIGATION RUNS BOTH WAYS, which an earlier version left half-enforced.
// A missing required side was dropped, and a quote on a side the category does
// not use was silently ERASED. That let an `omission` arrive carrying candidate
// text, which is a contradiction in terms, and let a voice escape a paired
// category's evidence obligation by filing the same claim as one-sided. Both
// directions are refused here.
//
// A DROPPED CLAIM IS NOT EVIDENCE OF FIDELITY, and the tally says so separately:
// a voice that reported nothing and a voice whose every claim was dropped are
// different facts, and reading them as one would let a run of unanchored
// answers look like agreement that a rendering is sound.
