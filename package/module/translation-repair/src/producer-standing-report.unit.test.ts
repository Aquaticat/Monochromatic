/**
 Tests for rendering and ordering producer standings.
 
 WHAT THESE PIN is the pair of decisions a reader of a calibration report has
 to trust: that a share always arrives with the denominator behind it, and
 that a model no disinterested judge ever voted on sorts to the END rather
 than to the bottom. The second is the one that changes conclusions. A model
 with no evidence and a model measured at zero are different findings, and a
 ranking that put them side by side would report the first as the second.
 
 Counts are invention. Model ids come from the catalog, since the standing
 type takes a roster id and a made-up one would not type.
