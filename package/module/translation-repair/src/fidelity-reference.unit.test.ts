/**
 Tests for the reviewed fidelity references: building one from pinned files
 and its manifest entry, selecting manifest entries, expanding references
 into the fixed trial matrix, and the checked-in manifest's own invariants.
 The request check and the pinned corpus read have files of their own.

 Every refusal case names the verification boundary that fired and asserts
 the whole message, so a refusal raised at another boundary fails the case
 that expects this one. Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content
 appears here; the manifest cases read the checked-in manifest's metadata
 only.
