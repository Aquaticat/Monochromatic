/**
 Guards the whole-package audit of 2026-09-27 on the house policy's own
 wording, each sentence a place where the rule said something other than
 what the corpus and the owner's rulings ask:

 - no producing sheet said the house rules outrank the sheet's own rules, so
   the refiner's "keep every word left in the original language" sat beside
   the rule rendering Ta, titles and handles, unresolved;
 - the reader-protection sample "the page says that she ended her life" stood
   in a bullet opening on "a death or an attempt", the class seventy-nine
   shape class one hundred twenty-four's later sentence contradicts;
 - "Entries are written in the third person" against contributors writing
   我, whom the kept-subject rule renders as I;
 - "MtF is trans woman, as 药娘 is" narrower than the owner's "trans girl or
   trans woman";
 - "kept and glossed" never said the kept term is not left in Han, and runs
   shipped "大证 (...)" in English prose;
 - the positional-word rule read as a ban on "earlier" and "below" in any
   sense;
 - the corner-bracket rule's second example kept quotation marks the rule
   said are dropped;
 - the measuring sheets' reader-protection line named deaths only;
 - the rendering audit called a tense English supplies an altered time.
