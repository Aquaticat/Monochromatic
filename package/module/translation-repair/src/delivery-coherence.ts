//region Delivery coherence
// The rule tying one row's DELIVERY to the rest of the row, for readers that
// did not build it.
//
// `buildSliceDelivery` decides these four cases and can only produce coherent
// ones. It is not the only way a row reaches a consumer: the type is exported,
// the lane comparison takes ledgers from a caller, and an artifact reader takes
// them from disk. At each of those the builder's guarantee is somebody else's
// assumption, and a row that contradicts itself is individually well formed in
// every field.
//
// So the four cases are stated once here as a rule, and every boundary that
// accepts a row rather than building one asserts it.
