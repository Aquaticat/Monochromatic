// LEDGER X6 (the whole-package audit, 2026-09-28): the translate lane's
// alignment, quote-loss and declared-name refusals keep the archive wherever
// one exists, and the consolidation judges what a lane keeps by the
// deterministic publication rule. An archive that rule refuses was therefore
// kept only to be refused as a standing, and the replacement the judges chose
// never reached the slate: up to 47 slices in the run logs (a refusal kept the
// archive and the consolidation refused that slice's standing, whichever lane
// the standing came from), 46 of them for a link the original carries.
//
// THE SAME QUESTION THE CONSOLIDATION ASKS, from the same inputs: the slice's
// original, the archive wording it would keep as both candidate and page (the
// eligible stand-in on a disputed slice, as the consolidation's incumbent is),
// the front-matter role, the line-structure rule, the declared name pairs and
// the disputed wordings (`readStandingVerdict`). THE SAME ANSWER TOO: an
// original the grammar cannot read gives no verdict (`unknown`), and the
// consolidation refuses a standing on that as it does on a finding, so no
// refusal here keeps the archive on it either.
//
// REACH NOT MEASURED ON THE AGREEMENT PATH. Where the repair lane also left
// the archive, a kept archive made the lanes agree and the slice shipped
// with no floor at all, so no consolidation line records it; those slices
// now go through the contest and the consolidation whenever the archive fails
// the rule. The TianqiChen666 runs refused nothing in the translate lane.
