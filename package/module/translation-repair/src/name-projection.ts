// A NAME AS THE LETTERS AND DIGITS IT IS WRITTEN WITH, and where each sits in
// the text, for the declared-name survival guard (`declared-name-survival.ts`)
// and the link-name floor (`translate-declared-link-name.ts`).
//
// WHY A PROJECTION. A handle is written several ways across one archive: with
// `\_` where the declaration writes `_`, with a space where the other side
// writes an underscore or nothing, split over a wrapped line behind a `> `
// prefix. Reduced to its letters and digits, lowercased, each of those is the
// same key, which a raw substring comparison cannot see through (the guard's
// header has the measurement).
//
// WHY THE OFFSETS (ledger B23). The projection drops the spaces and marks
// between words along with those inside a handle, so containment alone finds
// a key across a word edge: `ann` inside `cannot`. A found key counts only
// where each of its Latin edges meets a word edge in the text, read in the
// text itself, which is why every projected unit keeps where its character
// sits.

 A text projected onto the characters a name is made of.

 COMPOSED BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE, because a combining mark is neither a letter
 nor a digit and would be dropped where a precomposed one is kept: `Mikä`
 written the two ways would otherwise yield two keys, and the guard would
 report a name lost that is sitting right there.

 SCANNED BY CODE POINT, not by grapheme and not by UTF-16 unit. A letter
 beyond the first plane (a Han ideograph from Extension B, a letter in
 mathematical script) is two units, and neither half is a letter, so a scan
 by unit dropped it from the key (ledger B22). An emoji is neither a letter
 nor a digit, so it drops out of the key, from both sides alike.

 LOWERED ONE CHARACTER AT A TIME, so each kept character knows the character
 it came from; a key and a text are both projected here, so both lower alike.
