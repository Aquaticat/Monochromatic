/**
 Guards class fifty-one (shi_Yumiaoya4, 2026-09-17): a claim of coverage
 whose quote sits inside a target region the pairing already assigned to
 another source slice is no evidence that THIS passage is rendered, since
 that English is the rendering of a different original. One voice quoted the
 archive's farewell line as partial coverage of the death paragraphs, the
 claim anchored, and the split it made left the passage a recorded gap.
 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
