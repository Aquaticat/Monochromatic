// WHAT THE CHECKER SHEET SHOWS BESIDE THE DOCUMENTS (ledger L14, 2026-09-28).
// The sheet showed the ORIGINAL, the REVISED TRANSLATION and each claim's
// category, severity and summary. The panel that accepted the issue also saw
// the declared names with their rules, the cited references and the claim's
// own quotes; the checker saw none of them, while its `worse` ballots strip
// an edit (ledger L3) and roll a rewrite back (ledger L11).

/**
 How a checker reads the quotes under each claim, stated on every checker
 sheet.

 THE TRANSLATION QUOTES ARE THE TEXT BEFORE THE REVISION: the critic quoted
 the archive wording it objected to, which the REVISED TRANSLATION may no
 longer carry, so a checker told nothing would search the revised text for
 it. JSON strings because 349 of 45,860 quotes over every artifact span more
 than one line, and a raw one would open lines of its own in a sheet whose
 issues are told apart by the lines that open them.

 @example
 ```ts
 const system = `${RULES}\n\n${CHECKER_QUOTE_RULE}`;
 ```
 */

  + ' and text quoted from the TRANSLATION as it stood before this revision, which the REVISED TRANSLATION'
  + ' may no longer carry. An insertion point marks where the claim says content was missing.';

/**
 What a checker does with a rendering the DECLARED NAMES block settles,
 stated after the rules every sheet reads the block by.

 @example
 ```ts
 const system = `${DECLARED_IDENTITY_RULES}\n${CHECKER_IDENTITY_RULE}`;

  + ' declares it has not damaged it; a revision that moves one away from its declared value is worse.';

/**
 What a checker does with the cited references.

 THEY NEVER REOPEN AN ACCEPTED ISSUE. The panel judged every claim with the
 references on its sheet, and the reference screen voided each addition claim
 on a detail a reference states word for word (class thirty-seven), so an
 accepted accuracy/addition issue reaching the checkers survived both. The
 checker judges whether the revision fixed what was accepted, on less
 evidence than the panel had, and is no second panel.

 @example
 ```ts
 const system = `${RULES}\n\n${CHECKER_REFERENCE_RULE}`;
 ```
 */

  + ' still fixed only by removing its detail.';
