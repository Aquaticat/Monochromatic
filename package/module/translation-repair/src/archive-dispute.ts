//region Archive dispute
// A slice whose archive rendering the repair lane's adjudicators found to
// ADD something the original never states (class one hundred seven, owner
// answer 2026-09-24: "Not eligible; fall back to the repair text"). On
// CuspariaKLSY10 slice 3 the archive named a suicide method the original
// does not, four `accuracy/addition` claims were accepted, the repair lane
// removed the detail, the translate slate backed nobody, and the archive
// stood because an eligible standing keeps its single round. Here such a
// slice is a dispute: the repair lane's text stands in for the archive as
// the translate lane's incumbent and as the consolidation's standing where
// the contest chose neither lane.
//
// ONLY WHERE THE REPAIR FIXED IT (owner answer 2026-09-27, "No eligible
// standing"). The repair lane's text is the archive's own wording wherever
// its accuracy patch lost at the checkers, or a refinement keeping the
// reading, so the stand-in carried the disputed reading on 86 of 87 measured
// disputed slices. It stands in now only where the checkers confirmed every
// disputing issue resolved and the lane kept the slice; elsewhere the archive
// wording and the repair lane's text are disputed wordings the deterministic
// rule refuses (`disputed-wording.ts`), so neither is a candidate, a fallback,
// a standing or a lane offer anywhere downstream.
//
// CLASS ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY-SIX (TianqiChen66610 slice 13, owner answer
// 2026-09-27: "Major+ accuracy"). The adjudicators accepted major
// mistranslation claims against the archive's gloss of the character a
// performer was remembered as, the gate tied 2 to 2, and the archive shipped
// because only additions disputed it. Any accepted accuracy claim at major
// severity or worse now disputes the archive as well; additions keep
// disputing at any severity.
//
// THE SEVERITY IS THE PANEL'S (owner answer 2026-09-27: "Adjudicated"). The
// rule first read each claim's severity as its critic filed it: on XingZ6014
// a claim filed major disputed slice 66 though the panel settled the issue
// minor, and slice 19 went undisputed though the panel settled its issue
// major. The issue's settled severity is what the rule and the note read.
//
// NO ACCEPTED ISSUE SETTLES AT NEUTRAL (ledger L5, 2026-09-28). The tally
// holds an acceptance settled at neutral, the severity asserting no defect,
// for a human, so "addition at any severity" reaches minor and worse in
// effect: an addition claim no supporter finds a real defect in disputes
// nothing. Before, five accepted neutral additions over every run could
// dispute an archive on a finding that named no defect.

 THE HUNDRED-AND-EIGHTH CLASS (CuspariaKLSY11 slice 3, 2026-09-24). The
 repair lane softened the archive's invented suicide method to "She took
 medication that night", the consolidated proposal dropped it, and the gate
 kept the stand-in 2 to 1 as "dropped page content ... which the Chinese does
 not contradict": the page apparatus clause protected on the stand-in the very
 detail the stand-in exists to remove. ONE WORDING FOR EVERY SHEET, as that
 clause is, so the writer, the slate judge, the gate and the contest read the
 same rule about the same detail.

 THE ONE HUNDRED FORTY-FOURTH CLASS (hulicaijia27 chunk 69, 2026-09-26). The
 same block made one panel's verdict final on every later sheet, whatever the
 claim named. The panel accepted the archive's footnote 7, a note explaining
 the pun between 晚安 and 金刚烷胺, as an addition 3 to 2, and the block told
 the translate slate that no detail the claim names is apparatus: all four
 judges voted the note out, one citing the accepted claim. So the block's
 bar is narrative detail, stated as the page-apparatus clause bounds it,
