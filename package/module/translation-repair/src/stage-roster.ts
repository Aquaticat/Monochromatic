//region Stage roster
// Whether a fan-out stage ran with the roster it was configured with.
//
// Renamed from the refine-only version once the same failure appeared in the
// editor stage: a count that answers "could this stage speak" is not a property
// of the naturalness lane, it is a property of every stage that fans out.
//
// The stages that matter here write one finding per unit of work naming how
// many voices they heard out of how many they asked, for example
// `editor-candidates (1/2 heard, 1 repairing)`. That string is the ONLY record
// that a stage ran degraded: the outcome it produces is shaped exactly like the
// outcome of a healthy stage with less to do.
//
// Why this is worth counting, from live data rather than in principle. Between
// two consecutive passes on unchanged pipeline code, one model went from zero
// schema-mismatches to 61 across all four roles it holds. In the pass where it
// failed, one settled entry repaired all nine of its chunks with a single
// editor heard out of two, and nothing anywhere reported a fault. The editor
// ensemble exists precisely so no single model writes the shipped text, and it
// had stopped being an ensemble.
