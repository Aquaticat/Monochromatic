//region OpenRouter abandoned spend
// A STREAM THIS PIPELINE STOPPED READING WAS STILL PAID FOR, and until
// 2026-09-09 nothing wrote that down. `SPEND` lines are written off the usage
// block of a completed stream, so a round's straggler cut, a stall, an overrun
// or a degenerate ending left no line at all, and the log summed 141.62 USD
// where the meter had moved 199.92 between the top-up of 2026-09-08 and the
// refusal of 2026-09-09. The missing 58 were 2,135 abandoned streams.
//
// ESTIMATED, AND SAID SO. The wire reports cost only at the end, so an
// abandoned call's cost is reconstructed: completion tokens from the raw
// stream characters delivered at each model's measured ratio, prompt tokens
// from the request body's bytes, both priced at the listing's rates. The line
// carries `estimated=abandoned` so a reader can total it beside the reported
// lines or apart from them. The estimate over-reads a stream on an endpoint
// that honoured the cancel and under-reads one that generated on past the cut,
// which is why the ceiling in `completion-cap.ts` is the bound and
// this is the record.
