/**
 Tests the assembly guard on a page that reads as no document although every
 replacement reads in its own slice.

 THE SHAPE UNDER TEST. The nesting scan is stateful across lines: a fence one
 slice opens and never closes is closed by the fence line of the slice after
 it, so that slice's text, skipped as code on its own, is a paragraph the parser
 nests on the page. Each replacement passes every check of its own slice, and
 the page they make is refused by the plain grammar. The guard reads that as the
 strongest structural regression there is and withdraws the replacement that
 caused it, as it does any other, where it once let the refusal end the document.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
