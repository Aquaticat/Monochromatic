//region Line endings
// Folding Windows line endings to the one form every splitter here looks for.
//
// MEASURED, NOT DEFENSIVE. Of the 184 markdown files in the pinned corpus, one
// uses CRLF throughout: a source page. A splitter looking for `\n\n` never
// finds a boundary in it, so the line-structure predicate counted the whole
// page as one block and answered false, the invisible-line mask saw a `\r` on
// every line and blanked none, and the quote normalizer read each ending as
// two breaks and refused every wrapped quote. One fold at the corpus read
// closes all three, and the two splitters fold again for callers that read
// text by other means.
