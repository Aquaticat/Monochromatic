/**
 Guards class one hundred forty-nine (hulicaijia30, 2026-09-26): Hyper's
 thousand request starts in a rolling hour were spent in the pass's first 33
 minutes, the pacer made the next Hyper call wait 1,640,012 ms, and the
 router kept sending Hyper the models OpenRouter serves too, so eight
 translate slices stalled 27 to 34 minutes. A provider whose request window
 would make the call wait is saturated: the call overflows to a usable
 provider behind it, and queues on the paced provider only when nobody
 usable stands behind. Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content
 appears here.
