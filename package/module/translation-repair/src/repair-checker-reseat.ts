//region Checker bench at the stage
// THE CHECKER STAGE READS THE SEATING AGAIN AT THE STAGE ITSELF (class one
// hundred nine, zheermao9, 2026-09-24). The class one hundred three re-seat
// lands where a chunk starts, but the repair lane runs eight chunks at once,
// so the chunks already in flight when Synthetic's weekly allowance ran out
// kept the bench read at their start: seven of eight checker rounds asked
// the two Synthetic-only seats a minute after the dry-out and heard one
// voice, short of quorum, while five re-seat lines had already named a
// bench with two reachable seats for chunks not yet started. A chunk's
// checker stage runs after its critics, panel, editor and select judges,
// which is minutes on a live bench, so it asks the hook again here and runs
// on whatever the reading seats now. It costs nothing while nothing is
// held: the hook returns the seating it last read.

 LEDGER B29. The chunk check left the refiners out, while its TSDoc said it
 refused a checker who refines and every other caller of the independence
 check passes them; and the bench read at the stage was read for quorum
 alone, so a re-seat naming this chunk's editor would have had it grade its
 own rewrite. Production seats derived benches against the static editors
 and refiners (`corpus-run/run-seats.ts`), so neither reached a run.
