/**
 Guards against references by position (ledger D33): "the case above", "see
 below", "the paragraph before this", "the latter". A reference by position
 names nothing once a case, a paragraph or a line is added between the two, so
 the repository rule is to name what a text points at: a case by its name, a
 constant or function by its identifier, a doc by its heading or ledger entry.
 The census found 296 such phrases in the package and 79 in the living docs.

 WHAT IS READ is every text the task-number guard reads: the package's
 TypeScript under `src` (comments and strings alike, since a test's name is a
 string), its docs, README and task file, and the living repository-level
 docs. Wrapped comment and string lines are joined first, so a phrase broken
 across two lines is still one phrase.

 WHAT IS FOUND is the shapes a positional reference takes, matched over words:
 a reference verb before "above" or "below" ("see above", "described
 below"); "above" or "below" in parentheses; ANY WORD before either ("the case
 above", "the estimate below", "either early return below"), unless that word
 marks a comparison, a bound or a placement ("at or above", "unbounded below",
 "far above", "sits above"), what follows makes it a comparison ("ranks the
 house rules above its own", "a rate above one", "the threshold below which")
 or what follows names the target ("a heading above" a quoted heading, "above
 `limit`"); a structure noun before "before this" or "after it"; "earlier in
 this file" and its kin; and "the former" or "the latter".

 ANY WORD, NOT A LIST OF NOUNS, since 2026-09-29. The guard first read a
 position as a pointer only after a listed structure noun ("case", "list",
 "count"), and a scan for "above" and "below" ending a phrase then found a
 couple of hundred pointers after nouns no list held ("the estimate below",
 "the walk below", "the rethrows below", "the standing directive below"). A
 physical position ending a phrase ("slept below.") now reads as a pointer
 too; outside page text, which is exempt, the texts this guard reads hold
 none.

 WHAT IS LEFT is a phrase inside double quotes, which quotes the words rather
 than using them, a position inside a Markdown code span, which quotes data,
 and the exemptions, each named with its reason: positions in a page's own
 text (a note above a letter), comparisons the shapes cannot tell apart,
 Unicode character names, and the text of a model-facing sheet. A sheet is rendered whole, in the
 one order its builder fixes, and read once; editing one changes the cache key
 it is stored under, so a sheet's wording is exempt as a class. "The next
 heading" and "the previous section" are not read at all: this package handles
 documents, and those phrases name a unit of the data far more often than a
 unit of the text they sit in.

 THE FIXTURES COME FIRST, so the package-wide case is read against a scan
 shown able to find each shape (ledger M21). Fixtures are cat-themed.
