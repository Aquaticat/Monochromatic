//region Bilingual pair bound
// CLASS EIGHTY, SECOND ARM (shi_Yumiaoya11 and 12, 2026-09-22). The sheet
// clause of `bilingual-line-clause.ts` reached the translators, the judges
// and the editors, and the slate still chose the candidate that rendered the
// film quote's Chinese line a second time in English: deepseek-v4.1-flash
// called the candidate carrying the English alone "a dropped line ...
// ineligible" under the line criterion, and gemma-4-26b reasoned that the
// Chinese line "is a literal translation of the sentiment, which is distinct
// from the actual English quote". A judge without the film cannot see that
// the two lines are one, and no wording on a sheet gives it the film.
//
// THE EXISTING TRANSLATION SETTLES IT, BLOCK BY BLOCK. The human translator
// carried the pair as one line, and that text is on the sheet as the PAGE AS
// IT STANDS. A first cut compared the whole slice's line count with the lines
// owed and slept on shi_Yumiaoya12, because the archive writes the slice's
// closing line as two lines, so the whole-slice count never matched. The
// bound now finds the pair's English line in the page and in the rendering
// and compares the block holding it (the quote's lines, or the paragraph's):
// a rendering whose block carries more lines than the page's has rendered
// the Chinese half again, and is refused before the judges see it, the way
// class sixty-six withholds a rule-refused candidate. Where there is no page
// text, the page does not carry that English line as written, the page
// carries the Chinese line too, or the rendering reworded the English line,
// nothing is refused and the judges decide on the clause. Arita,
// NIGHT81473140, gqt and seven other entries carry a Chinese line followed by
// an English line of DIFFERENT content, which the pair count cannot tell
// from a translation pair; their pages carry both lines in the block, so the
// bound is silent there.
