/**
 Tests that `warnLinesDuring` keeps the work's warnings apart from the
 logger's own report of a sink it could not verify.

 IN A CHILD PROCESS, because the logger is built once a process, on its first
 line: only a process whose first line is logged inside the divert shows what
 a case in the suite meets when its file is the first to log. The child's
 working directory holds a regular file where the logger's file sink wants its
 log directory, so that sink's verify fails at once and the logger reports it
 on `console.warn` itself, untagged. A file sink slow to verify under load
 reports the same way five seconds later (ledger B140); the regular file
 stands in for the load without waiting on it.

 TWO LOGGERS SHARE A TEST PROCESS: the one the built package bundles, which
 the code under test writes through, and module-logger's default logger,
 which the test framework writes through. Each reports its own sinks.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention.
