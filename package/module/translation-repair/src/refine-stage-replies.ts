 The finding for one operation the patch refused.

 The refusal this lane reaches is `unchanged-region`, a rewrite that
 comes out as the paragraph it replaces. Its operations are bound to the
 sheet's own envelopes by the resolver (so the envelope is known, claimed once
 and carries its own hash), the envelopes are derived from the very text the
 patch is applied to (so the region cannot have drifted), and the patch runs
 with preservation skipped (so no preservation refusal exists). A bounded probe
 over generated documents reached no other reason.

 The patch also refuses a text no grammar reads, which the atom gate has
 already refused for a rewrite read alone, so a rewrite reaches it only where
 the two readings disagree; it is named as an unreadable rewrite and never
 ends the stage.
 Any other reason is a broken invariant and throws.
