/**
 Tests for what the damage probe's report decides for a naturalness rewrite.

 The verdict has three exits: an admitted claim rolls the rewrite back, a
 round short of its quorum rolls it back under its own wording, and a round
 with neither lets the rewrite ship. The settler's cases reach these only
 through a whole settlement; these hold each exit, each plural, and the order
 between the first two against the function directly.
