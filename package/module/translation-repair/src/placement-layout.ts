// Whether a preparation's target spans can be written back into the document
// they were cut from.
//
// SEPARATE FROM INDEXING, which `slice-indexing.ts` covers. That file proves a
// slice is CALLED what its position says; this one proves the slice POINTS
// somewhere sane. Both were the same statement while every span came from a
// disjoint run of nodes, and `#100` separates them: an insertion anchor covers
// no nodes at all, so nothing about its offsets follows from how it was carved.
//
// ONE ORDERING RULE COVERS THE WHOLE LIST the review asked for. Every span
// starts at or after the previous span's END, and from that single statement
// follow: non-empty spans never overlap; an insertion never lands strictly
// inside a span; two non-empty spans never start at one offset; an insertion
// never sits after a span it shares a boundary with; and no placement moves
// backwards. What it still ALLOWS is every legal shape: several insertions at
// one boundary, an insertion at a span's start meaning before it, an insertion
// at a span's end, and adjacent spans that touch.
//
// WHY IT MATTERS MORE THAN IT LOOKS: `String.prototype.slice` clamps. A span
// running past the end of the document, or backwards, produces plausible text
// rather than a diagnostic, and assembly then ships a document nobody can tell
// is wrong from the output alone.
