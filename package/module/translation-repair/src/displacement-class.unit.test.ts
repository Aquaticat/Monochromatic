 * Tests for the size screen that says WHAT a translation's size anomalies are:

 * WHAT THESE ARE FOR. The screen's first version reported one bucket, and its
 * count went into `#107` and Question 5 before anyone checked what was in it.
 * These fixtures are the labelled cases that check came back with: the two
 * relocations verified by reading both documents, the three anomalous entries
 * that turned out to be other phenomena, and an ordinary document that must stay
 * silent. Each carries the shape of a real reading with invented counts.
 *
 * Fixtures are invented counts, not corpus text.
