//region Translate alignment refusals
// The sentence a reader gets for every slice whose replacement the alignment
// guard refused.
//
// Split out of the driver with the assembly it belongs to: it reads settled
// records and builds prose, which is reporting rather than translating, and the
// driver was over its line budget with both.

/**
 Names what the alignment guard measured, for callers building a report.

 DERIVED RATHER THAN STORED. The sentence names a slice by its index, and a
 settled record is keyed by what the models were asked, which since translate
 version 2 excludes the index. The same record can therefore be resumed at a
 different position, so the only trustworthy index is the one the record
 carries after the driver stamps it, which is the one this reads.

 @param records - settled slice records

 @returns Refusal findings in the order the slices appear

 @throws {@link UnhandledMemberInvariantError} when a member of `TranslateDisposition` has no branch here, which the compiler rules out, since a record that is neither a refusal nor a stage result has no finding

 @example
 ```ts
 const refusals = alignmentRefusals({ records: result.slices, },);
 ```
