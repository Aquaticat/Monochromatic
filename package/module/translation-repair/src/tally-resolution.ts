/**
 Tallies checker ballots per issue, discounting a checker that helped write the
 text it is judging.
 An issue with no cast verdicts stays unresolved and unregressed:
 silence proves nothing in either direction.

 A DISCOUNT RATHER THAN A BAR. A model that wrote a repair is often best placed
 to see whether it worked, so its verdict is heard at {@link SELF_VOTE_WEIGHT}
 rather than discarded.

 THE DISCOUNT IS DIRECTION-BLIND. An author calling its own work `not-fixed` is
 halved exactly as one calling it `fixed` is, because what is being weighed is
 the stake in the text, not which way the answer points.

 ONE CAST BALLOT RESOLVES NOTHING, whatever its weight, since 2026-09-27
 ({@link MIN_RESOLUTION_BALLOTS}). This was previously accepted, since half a vote
 outweighs none, and it reached far past the lone author: 759 of 8,788
 recorded readings over 403 run directories resolved on one ballot, 756 of
 them inside a selected patch, where a checker omitted the issue or the
 bench had one voice left. The owner's rule of 2026-08-12 is that no single
 model decides.

 `regressed` KEEPS NO FLOOR. It only ranks a candidate below one that
 regressed nothing and never ships text, and on a two-voice bench a lone
 `worse` already ties rather than regresses: the checkers voted `worse` 55
 times over the recent runs and `regressed` never fired (ledger L1).
