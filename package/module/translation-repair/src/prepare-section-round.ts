//region Section pairing round
// BUYS A SECTION PAIRING, BUT ONLY WHERE THE DETERMINISTIC ALIGNER REFUSED.
//
// Measured over the pinned corpus: 85 of 92 entries have equal section shape
// and never reach the aligner at all, and 5 of the remaining 7 align with no
// refusal. Two entries are ever asked, and on those two the aligner's affinity
// grid is almost entirely zeros, because it scores headings by token overlap
// and Chinese headings share no tokens with English ones.
//
// ASKING WHERE IT DID NOT REFUSE WOULD BE WORSE, not merely wasteful. A forced
// pairing lies on every optimal path, which is a stronger claim than a roster
// vote, and replacing one with the other would trade a proof for an opinion.
