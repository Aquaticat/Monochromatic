//region Community glossary
// THE COMMUNITY'S WORDS, beside the corpus pin (`corpus-source.ts`), by the
// owner's decision of 2026-09-09 (`doc/decision/translation-repair-community-glossary.md`).
// Two pages shipped the community's words wrong where the archive had them
// right: 自切 as "self-harmed by cutting" and "After she began cutting
// herself" where the archive has "attempted self-surgery"; 超天酱 as
// "Choco-chan" and "Chōten-chan" where the archive has "KAngel" of Needy
// Streamer Overload. Nothing in the pipeline told the bench, so nothing
// stopped it regressing a correct rendering twice.
//
// THREE USES. Every sheet that carries the declared names carries the terms
// an entry's source holds (`communityTermLines`, read into the identity
// context by `document-preparation.ts`), so writers and judges alike know the
// word. The sheets where judges compare candidates name each candidate
// lacking every accepted rendering where the source carries the term
// (`communityRenderingsBlock`): evidence to weigh, not a verdict, and how the
// archive's rendering joins every slate. And since class one hundred nineteen
// (2026-09-24) a floor refuses a candidate that keeps a term in Han or writes
// a form its entry refuses (`translate-community-term.ts`). No listed
// rendering is ever required, since a rendering inflects and the judges
// decide; until ledger C6 (2026-09-28) this comment said no candidate was
// barred, which the floor had made false.
//
// THE OWNER CURATES IT. An entry goes in wherever a run shipped the word
// wrong, whether or not the archive had it right: the archive wrote "tried
// coming out" for 炸柜 and "Alona and Atori" for 阿洛娜 and 亚托莉. The
// renderings are the archive's first where the archive renders the word
// well, then forms the community also uses. Where no archive renders the term
// well (药娘 by the owner's ruling, 逆子 where the only passage has no archive
// English), the renderings are the ones the entry's why states. Until ledger
// C6 this comment said a term the archive got wrong is not entered.
