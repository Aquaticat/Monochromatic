//region Unwrapped link floor
// THE ONE HUNDRED FIFTEENTH CLASS (yingying10, 2026-09-24). A translate
// candidate rendered the original's linked blog title as plain words with the
// bare destination in parentheses after them, and every floor passed it: the
// destination floor reads a bare URL as an autolink, so the destination
// survived, and the declared link name floor (class one hundred fourteen) is
// silent where the rendering carries no link under the href. It reached the
// slate and drew a ballot. The corpus census at the pin found no archive that
// renders a source's worded link this way (119 of 141 kept under the same
// href, the rest dropped outright, which the destination floor refuses), so
// the floor refuses no archive text.
//
// A WORDED LINK is `[words](href)` whose words show a reader something and
// are not the href itself. Where the original carries more worded links under an href than the
// rendering does while the rendering still carries the href, the link was
// unwrapped. Silent where the rendering drops the href outright: that is the
// destination floor's finding, not this one's.
//
// "STILL CARRIES THE HREF" IS THE DESTINATION FLOOR'S READING (ledger B23):
// the rendering's link destinations, worded or bare, as the slice grammar
// parses them. A raw substring took an address that only begins with the
// href (`windowsill-nap.html2`) for the href kept, and told the model its
// destination was intact when it had changed.
//
// A RENDERING THE STRICT GRAMMAR REFUSES IS READ UNDER PLAIN MARKDOWN, the
// downgrade the page side already takes (`translate-skeleton-page.ts`), and
// never as carrying nothing. Where the original is readable the validator
// refuses such a rendering at its parse anyway. Where the original is refused
// too, the validator runs only the floors that need no grammar and otherwise
// answers unknown, which translate-repair lets stand as written, so a floor
// gone silent there would pass a genuine unwrap. Plain markdown reads no MDX:
// a bare destination inside a raw html block is not a link there, and the
// floor is silent on it, where the old substring reading refused.

 Whether a link carries words of its own rather than its destination.

 WORDS ARE WHAT A READER SEES, asked of `rendersAsNothing` (ledger B40): asked
 of the trimmed text against the empty string, a rendering that wrote the
 title as plain words beside a link of one zero-width space or Hangul filler
 kept a worded link by count and passed the floor unwrapped.

 @param link - link as scanned

 href

/**
 Atoms of a rendering: the strict grammar's where it reads the text, plain
 markdown's where it refuses, none where neither reads it.

 A TEXT NESTED TOO DEEPLY TO READ CARRIES NO ATOMS HERE. Plain markdown reads
 every input but one nested past the parse bound (`nesting-bound.ts`), which it
 refuses with a {@link MarkdownParseError}; that refusal is the grammar's own
 and not an unexpected state, and the floor that reads the candidate's shape
 (`translate-validate.ts`) refuses the same text with its own finding. Any
 other throw from plain markdown propagates, as {@link readSliceSkeleton}
 treats any error but the grammar's own refusal.

 empty for a text no grammar reads
