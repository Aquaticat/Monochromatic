/**
 * Tests for the two index scans the preservation gate compares text with.
 *
 * BOTH ARE REACHED ONLY THROUGH `preservation-check.ts`, which asks them one
 * question each about whole passages and then reports a verdict about an edit.
 * That makes every rule here visible to the suite only as a gate outcome, and a
 * gate has two outcomes while these have sixteen branches between them. What
 * follows asks each rule directly.
 *
 * THE THREE RULES THAT COST SOMETHING WHEN THEY WERE WRONG, each named in the
 * module's own comments and each pinned here. A colon is not a sentence end,
 * and reading it as one made a deleted contributor name invisible. A
 * sentence-initial capital is not a name, and reading it as one rejected edits
 * for losing "Moreover". A two-letter capital is not a name, because initials
 * and abbreviations vanish in any ordinary rewrite.
 *
 * WHY IDEOGRAPHS GET THEIR OWN CASES. `contentTokens` drops one-character
 * tokens, since a lone ASCII letter carries nothing, and a one-character
 * Chinese token is a whole word. The two rules meet in the same loop and the
 * second one has to win.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
