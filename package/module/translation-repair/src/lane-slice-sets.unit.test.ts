/**
 * Tests for the five checks every list of named slices has to pass.
 *
 * WHY THESE ARE WORTH ASKING DIRECTLY. Three lists exist and they arrived one
 * at a time, each written as its own loop against the preparation, until by the
 * third they were the same five checks with the wording changed. That is how
 * the disjointness between them came to be checked in one direction only. The
 * checks now live in one place and the lists differ by data, so a case here
 * asks a rule once and every list inherits the answer.
 *
 * THE ORDER IS PART OF THE CONTRACT, not an implementation detail, and two
 * cases pin it. A slice named by two lists disagrees with itself before it
 * disagrees with the archive, so it must report the contradiction between the
 * lists rather than whichever archive rule the earlier list happens to break.
 * A slice that is also decided reports that first of all.
 *
 * WHAT THE ARCHIVE RULE IS FOR. Every list is legal at one kind of slice only,
 * and getting that wrong is how an exemption list turns into a way around the
 * coverage rule: name a translated slice `unfilled` and the lane is excused
 * from saying anything about text the archive already holds.
 *
 * `lane-slice-text.ts` is the only caller, and it hands in whatever three lists
 * a finished lane produced. A valid lane reaches none of these refusals.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
