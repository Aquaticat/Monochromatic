 READ THROUGH THE PARSER'S OWN CLASS, whose position and code are typed.
 `yaml` raises a syntax refusal as a `YAMLError` carrying both, its position
 always set from the line counter `parse` creates, and an anchor fault (an
 alias naming no anchor, an anchor holding itself) as a plain
 `ReferenceError` or `TypeError` carrying neither. Shape checks on an
 unknown value stood here, and their stand-ins for a value not an `Error`
 and for a malformed position answered states the parser never produces,
 where a changed parser should fail loudly instead (T8, twenty-third batch).
 
 @param cause - the parser's refusal
 
 @returns Phrase naming position and fault code
 
 @throws {@link Error} when a syntax refusal carries no position, which the

 exactly that, and the consequence is not a missing field: the whole YAML
 block is then parsed as body, where `---` becomes a thematic break and
 `name: Ara` becomes a setext heading. The critics receive the metadata as
 content to compare, and the identity context built from front matter is
 empty for the one entry whose names most needed declaring.
 
 Matching rather than rewriting, because every offset downstream indexes the
 original text and normalising line endings would move all of them.
