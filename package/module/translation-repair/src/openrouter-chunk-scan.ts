// EVERY PARSED CHUNK OF A DRAINED CHAT COMPLETIONS STREAM, for the readers
// that want one field off the gateway's envelope rather than the generated
// text: the USD cost on the final chunk (`openrouter-cost.ts`) and the
// upstream endpoint named on every chunk (`openrouter-endpoint.ts`).
//
// SCANNED SEPARATELY FROM THE COMPLETION READER, which is shared with
// Synthetic and reports only text and token counts. Adding gateway-specific
// fields to `ExtractedCompletion` would make every other reader carry values
// it cannot fill.

/**
 Every chunk of one drained stream that parses as a JSON object, in arrival
 order.

 NOTHING HERE THROWS: a chunk that does not parse was already refused or
 accepted by the completion reader, and this scan reports nothing about it.
 The `[DONE]` sentinel, blank keep-alives and comment lines carry no JSON, so
 the parse fails on each and it is skipped. A chunk whose payload opens with
 spaces before its brace parses and is read, as the completion reader reads
 it.

 @param bodyText - whole drained `text/event-stream` body

 @returns Parsed chunks that are objects

 @example
 ```ts
 const chunks = openRouterChunksOf({ bodyText: reply.bodyText, },);
 ```
