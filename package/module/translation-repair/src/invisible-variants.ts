// The 2026-08-26 output reading found "non-binary" written with U+2011
// NON-BREAKING HYPHEN where the archive had the ASCII hyphen, and nothing
// between the model and the page had noticed. Measured over every archive
// page at the pin, U+2011 occurs 11 times in 92 pages and the no-break space
// and soft hyphen never, so a model writing one of these is almost always
// reproducing a typing artefact of its own rather than the archive's usage.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT TOUCH. Typographic quotes (U+2018, U+2019, U+201C,
// U+201D), dashes (U+2013, U+2014) and the ellipsis (U+2026) are visible
// choices and the archive's own majority convention (1173 U+2019 across the
// corpus), so they pass through. The zero-width joiner (U+200D) is left alone
// because emoji sequences are built from it.
//
// APPLIED AT INTAKE, NOT AT PUBLISH. Both deciders judge the bytes that ship
// (`#162`); folding after judging would ship bytes nobody judged. The fold is
// therefore applied where each lane turns an answer into a candidate, so the
// candidate the judges see is the candidate that ships.
