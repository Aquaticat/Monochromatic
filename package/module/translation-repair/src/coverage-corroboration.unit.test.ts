/**
 * Tests for the deterministic half of the insertion gate.
 *
 * `doc/decision/translation-repair-absence-verdict.md` requires two independent
 * readings before anything is written into a page: the coverage roster must
 * call a passage absent, AND the page must be measurably too short to hold it.
 * These cover the second, which consults no model and so can be pinned exactly.
 *
 * WHAT WOULD GO WRONG WITHOUT THEM. A gate that reported every page as short
 * would wave through every insertion the roster proposed, and a gate that
 * reported none as short would silently disable the lane; both look identical
 * from outside, since both produce a run that raises nothing. The cases here
 * exercise both directions on the same fixture so neither degenerate answer can
 * pass.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. The corpus is unlicensed and this file is
 * committed, so no passage from it appears here; what is borrowed is the SHAPE,
 * a Chinese source beside an English rendering some multiple of its size.
 *
