// to leave a block unpartnered. Monotone because translations preserve order:
// blocks may be dropped, added, or merged, but never reordered wholesale, so a
// crossing alignment would be evidence of a different failure entirely.
//
// The walk reports skips rather than hiding them. The drift this replaces left
// no trace at all in any artifact, which is why it survived until a human
// graded the output.
