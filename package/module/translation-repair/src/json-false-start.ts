//region Json false start
// THE SEVENTEENTH CLASS, found by the tenth hakureico pass on 2026-09-08 and
// read back through the ninth: a reasoning stream sometimes opens its answer,
// abandons the opening, and then writes the whole object after it, so the
// answer channel reads `{"best": 1{"best": 1, "reason": ...}`,
// `{"{"resolution": ...}`, `{ {   "choice": ...}` or
// `{   "issues":{     "issues": [...]}`. Bedrock's gpt-oss-120b did it on six
// of the ninth pass's eight mismatches; OpenRouter's Makora route for
// deepseek-v4-flash-0731 did it on every mismatch of the tenth; every one of
// those streams carried reasoning characters, and no stream without them did.
// The object after the fragment is the model's answer, so it is read and the
// fragment's length is logged, where before the voice was lost.

 THE FALSE START BEFORE THE LEADING VALUE: a reply of two whole objects is
 the model revising its answer, and the replay of 587,102 stored replies on
 2026-09-28 found 18 such, the first empty or missing a field the second
 carries, so the later object is the answer and the false-start reader, which
 reads to the end of the text, already takes it. Trailing prose defeats that
 reader, since no brace inside the window starts JSON that runs to the end,
 and the leading value then recovers the answer (919 replies in that replay).
