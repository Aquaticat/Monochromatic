/**
 * Tests for the one-character rule that separates a verdict letter from a word

 * Both sheet readers depend on this and each exercises it only through its own
 * format, so the rule itself is tested here rather than twice at a distance.
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention mirroring corpus structure only.
