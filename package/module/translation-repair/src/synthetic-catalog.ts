/**
 * Every always-on Synthetic chat model this pipeline may call.
 *
 * These are the models the provider offers that this pipeline seats. The models
 * endpoint also lists `syn:large:text`, `syn:large:vision`, `syn:small:text`,
 * and `syn:small:vision`, and those are DELIBERATELY ABSENT here: each is a
 * moving alias, which the endpoint states in its `hugging_face_id` field.
 * Live on 2026-08-29 they point to GLM-5.3-Flash, Kimi-K3, GLM-4.7-Flash,
 * and Qwen3.8-27B respectively. An alias onto a seated model duplicates its
 * vote; an alias onto excluded GLM-4.7-Flash bypasses owner's blocklist.
 *
 * TWO REASONS, AND THE SECOND IS THE SERIOUS ONE.
 *
 * Admitting an alias would let one model occupy two seats on a voting panel,
 * so a single opinion would be counted as two independent confirmations and
 * the adjudication tally would silently overstate agreement. Any future roster
 * edit must dedupe on `hugging_face_id`, never on id.
 *
 * Worse, an alias is a promise the provider can move. This one is a very small
 * operation with no service level agreement, no guaranteed support window, and
 * partial support for the API surface it advertises. A repointed alias changes
 * WHICH MODEL VOTES with nothing in this repository changing, no build failing
 * and no log line saying so, which is the one class of roster change no guard
 * here can catch. Naming models outright makes a retirement an HTTP 404 we can
 * see rather than a substitution we cannot.
 *
 * One id was REPLACED 2026-08-29, `zai-org/GLM-5.2` by
 * `hf:zai-org/GLM-5.3-Flash`, after the live endpoint confirmed the successor
 * and the operational request reported Synthetic's plan to retire the older model. The endpoint reports
 * the successor as always-on beta with text and image input, 524288-token
 * context, 65536-token output, FP8 quantization, and tools, JSON mode,
 * structured outputs, and reasoning. The pipeline pins the successor rather
 * than following `syn:large:text`, which still resolved to the retiring model
 * during this migration.
 *
 * One id was REPLACED 2026-08-20, `Qwen/Qwen3-point-6-27B` by
 * `hf:Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B`, on notice that the provider would retire the older one
 * shortly and offers no service level agreement, so a retirement lands without
 * warning. The two are identical on every field this catalog records and on
 * every capability flag the endpoint reports: context, output ceiling,
 * modalities, features, quantization, always-on and price. The alias
 * `syn:small:vision` still resolved to the OLDER id when this was written, so
 * that alias breaks or repoints when the retirement lands; nothing here calls
 * it, and the dedupe rule above is what keeps that from mattering.
 *
 * Two ids were REMOVED 2026-08-05, `moonshotai/Kimi-K2.7-Code` and
 * `MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M3` (written without the `hf:` prefix here so a future
 * bulk id rewrite cannot silently edit this sentence, which is exactly what
 * happened once). Both now answer HTTP 404 "is no longer supported", and 404 is
 * not in the transient retry set, so leaving them listed cost a lost voice per
 * stage per call, silently.
 *
 * One id was REMOVED 2026-08-24, `zai-org/GLM-4.7-Flash` (again without the
 * prefix), blocklisted by the owner. `#136` had measured that it should stay,
 * and the owner overruled that on a roster that later changed independently.
 * It answers normally; nothing here calls it.
 *
 * One id was REMOVED 2026-08-29,
 * `nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-NVFP4`, at the owner's instruction
 * after adjacent required-correction reviews produced contradictory guidance.
 * Historical artifacts retain the exact departed identity, but no active
 * roster or callable catalog row reaches it.
