//region Span contiguity
// The one thing a span's own text cannot prove: that it covers what it claims to
// cover.
//
// A content chunk carries `nodes`, two offsets and the text between them, and
// the offsets are taken from the FIRST and LAST node of its run. Where a run is
// built by filtering, a document node lying between two of its members but
// absent from it is still inside the resulting range: the text is sliced from
// the offsets, so it contains that node's bytes, and the text-agreement check in
// `placement-layout.ts` passes byte for byte while `nodes` omits a whole block.
//
// WHAT THAT COSTS is silent and total for the omitted block: assembly writes
// over the offset range, so a replacement decided without ever seeing that
// block replaces it anyway. Nothing downstream can notice, because every later
// reader trusts the range.
//
// SO IT IS CHECKED AGAINST THE DOCUMENT rather than against the chunk. The rule
// is that a content chunk's nodes are exactly the document nodes its range
// contains: not a subset chosen by whoever built the run, and not a superset
// reaching outside the offsets.
