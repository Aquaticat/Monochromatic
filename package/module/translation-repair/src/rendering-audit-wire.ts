//region Rendering audit wire
// Asks whether one candidate rendering says what its original says, with NO
// before-text to compare against.
//
// WHY A SECOND INSTRUMENT RATHER THAN A WIDER FIRST ONE. The introduced-defect
// probe asks a DIFFERENTIAL question: does this replacement carry a defect the
// baseline did not have. That question needs a baseline, and a slice the
// translate lane rendered from scratch has none: there is no earlier wording of
// it that anybody produced. Widening that probe would have meant passing it an
// empty baseline and reading every defect as introduced, which is exactly the
// reading the differential form exists to avoid.
//
// SO THE QUESTION HERE IS ABSOLUTE: against the original, and against the
// identity evidence this run licensed, does the candidate fail to render or
// misrepresent anything. Nothing about improvement, nothing about the archive.
//
// THE ARCHIVE IS EXCLUDED AT THE CALLER, which is a narrower claim than an
// earlier version of this comment made. What is true: no archive text is ever
// serialized into these messages, and archive wording cannot anchor a quote,
// since a quote naming the original is searched in the ORIGINAL and nowhere
// else. What is NOT true, and was written here as though it were: that this
// makes a voice reason independently of an archive it may have seen elsewhere.
// Nothing here can establish that. The `reason` field is not screened at all,
// and a candidate-only finding needs no original quote.
//
// EVERY CATEGORY NAMES WHICH SIDE IT MUST ANCHOR IN, which is an evidence
// obligation rather than a proof. Content the candidate never rendered has
// nothing in the candidate to quote, its absence being the whole claim, so
// demanding a candidate span for an omission would make it unfileable. An
// addition nothing supports is the mirror. Everything else changes something
// both sides state, and must anchor in both. An anchored source span proves
// that the original says that; whether the candidate fails to render it is what
// the auditor claims and what corroboration weighs.
