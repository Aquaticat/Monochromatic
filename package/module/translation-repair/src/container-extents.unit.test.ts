/**
 * Tests for handing a dissolved container's tags to the blocks beside them.
 *
 * The defect this exists for is that a container's opening and closing tags
 * belong to no block once the container is dissolved, while every range in this
 * package is minted from block offsets. A boundary could therefore fall between
 * an opener and its closer, and assembly, which replaces a range and copies the
 * rest through, would delete one tag and keep the other.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention mirroring corpus structure only.
