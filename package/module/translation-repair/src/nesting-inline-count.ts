// mutable state the scan owns, and read against its bound as it grows.
//
// A TAG OPENS WHERE THE STRICT GRAMMAR READS ITS NAME, through the package's one
// reader of a tag name (`mdx-tag-name.ts`). This count once read a name as ASCII
// letters and digits, so a tag named in another script or opening with `$` or `_`,
// which the grammar nests, opened nothing here, and a name holding a character the
// grammar refuses opened one.

/**
 What the scan reads past a line's end when a tag's name or the whitespace after
 it reaches that end: a line ending, which the strict grammar steps over inside a
 tag as it steps over a space, then a name's letter and the tag's bracket. The
 next line is out of the scan's sight, and the grammar reads `<Paw`, `<Paw.` and
 `</` at a line's end as a tag the next line goes on with; where the next line
 does not go on with it, the page fails its compile, so a tag counted for it is
 one the bound can afford.
