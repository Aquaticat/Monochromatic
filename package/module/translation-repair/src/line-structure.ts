// a paragraph: verse, chat transcripts, lists of short statements.
//
// COMPUTED RATHER THAN JUDGED. The editor prompt previously asked the model to
// recognize this itself, and an attempt to write the same rule as a heuristic
// failed its positive control outright, ranking the one entry known to be verse
// 42nd of 54. A number the pipeline computes and hands over as a fact removes
// that guess from both sides.
//
// MEASURED over every corpus chunk: 49 of 275 trip, across 31 entries, and
// `Toka_ls`, whose editor fabricated three lines, trips at median 22 while its
// two prose chunks sit at 49 and 86. A threshold of 20 would have missed it,
// which is why the control was run before the threshold was chosen.
//
// The counts were 55 of 286 across 34 entries when first taken. Nothing about
// this predicate changed; the ALIGNER did, and chunk boundaries are
// its output. Re-measured through the shipped predicate on the forced aligner.
//
// BLOCKS ARE THE PARSE'S TOP-LEVEL NODES (ledger B68), not runs between blank
// lines: a loose list was five blocks to a split and is one list to the
// floor, and a tight list was one to both. Both counts in this header were
// taken through the split.
