// THE SELECT BALLOT PHRASED FOR A DECISION SEAT: the same task, criteria,
// evidence and anonymized candidates the chat sheet carries
// (`buildCandidateSelectMessages`), as a state object, and one choice
// question over the candidate numbers plus the decline. A decision seat
// answers with a number and a distribution and never a reason, so the
// ballot's `reason` carries the distribution, which is the audit trail a
// typed judge can give.
//
// THE HOUSE RULES TRAVEL IN THE STATE (the whole-package audit, 2026-09-27).
// The state once carried the criteria alone, so the seat read "every
// proposition of the ORIGINAL is rendered" with no word of reader
// protection, the tense order or the precedence line, and never heard of a
// community departure the chat seat was told of.
