//region Fidelity alteration
// The fixture that asks whether the judges read THE ORIGINAL, rather than
// whether they read well.
//
// WHAT THE OTHER TWO CANNOT SEPARATE. A deletion leaves a gap in the argument
// and an inserted sentence is a non-sequitur, so a judge that never looks at the
// Chinese, and simply prefers whichever English reads better, scores both in
// full. Passing them rules out habits; it does not show the source was consulted.
//
// THIS ONE CHANGES A NUMBER THE ORIGINAL ALSO STATES. Digits survive
// translation: a birth year written `2004年` in the Chinese is `2004` in the
// English, so the same run of characters sits on both sides and can be checked
// mechanically. Changing it in the English alone produces a candidate that is
// the SAME LENGTH, equally fluent, equally in register, and wrong about a fact
// the reader can only catch by looking at the original. No amount of reading the
// English decides it.
//
// GROUND TRUTH IS VERIFIED RATHER THAN ASSUMED, which is what makes this fixture
// stronger than a dropped qualifier. The number is only used when it occurs
// exactly once in the English and appears in the Chinese, and the replacement is
// only used when it appears in NEITHER, so the clean text is supported by the
// original and the damaged text is not.
//
// WHAT IT STILL DOES NOT PROVE: that a judge reads the source on ORDINARY
// slices. It shows whether the roster can, on a slice where nothing else can
// decide.
