/**
 Test-only lookups over the provider catalogs and the model cards (ledger
 B30). They shipped as package source while only tests called them: the
 roster-reach test proves every roster id is some provider's row through
 the label lookups, and the catalog tests read the Hyper counterpart split
 and single cards. Production reads the tables and `ROSTER_CARDS` directly.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
