/**
 * Tests for which side of the window carries which text.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The fidelity judge is shown two passages either side of
 * a slice: the ORIGINAL, which says what the neighbour is about, and the
 * ARCHIVE ENGLISH, which is the half that shows a relocation, because the
 * Chinese says each thing once in its own place while the English says it next
 * door. One record carries both so they provably come from one slice position.
 *
 * WHAT WAS MEASURED. On 2026-08-25, swapping the two sides failed no test in
 * this package. A judge would then be shown the English under the heading that
 * promises the Chinese, which is indistinguishable from an archive that moved a
 * passage: exactly the reading the window exists to support, arriving inverted.
 *
 * THE SLICE INDICES ARE NOT POSITIONS in the fixture, which pins the second
 * half of the same contract: the map is keyed by the index each slice was
 * STAMPED with, while the window is read by POSITION in the list.
 *
 * FIXTURES ARE CAST, following `translate-lane-wordings.unit.test.ts`: this
 * function reads two text fields and one index off a large pair model.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
