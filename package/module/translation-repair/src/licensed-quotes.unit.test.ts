/**
 * Tests for which quoted defect text an envelope is licensed to lose.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The preservation gate lets an edit delete exactly what
 * its issues quoted as the defect; everything else in the replaced span has to
 * survive. Three decisions inside that collection were measured on 2026-08-25
 * to decide nothing any case asserts, and each fails in its own direction.
 *
 * A SOURCE-SIDE QUOTE licensed nothing, because it is Chinese prose that never
 * appears in the English being edited, but it does widen the licence list an
 * editor is handed. AN EMPTY QUOTE licenses the empty string, which every span
 * contains, so the gate would wave through any deletion at all. AND A REPEATED
 * QUOTE, filed by two issues about the same wording, would be carried twice and
 * counted twice by anything reading the list as evidence.
 *
 * FIXTURES ARE CAST rather than fully built, following
 * `translate-lane-wordings.unit.test.ts`: this function reads four fields off
 * two large model types, and a faithful fixture would bury the case in
 * ballots, tallies and offsets that decide nothing here.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
