/**
 Guards class one hundred eighty-one (TianqiChen66613, 2026-09-27): the page
 is written in Canadian English, whose style (the Canadian Press Stylebook, as
 the archive follows it 224 times to 32) sets a period or comma inside the
 closing quotation mark. The bench wrote `the “high-performance robot”.` on a
 page that also wrote `“Old Man Chen,”`, so the typography restoration moves
 the mark inside.

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
