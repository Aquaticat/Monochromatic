/**
 * Tests for wrapping a consolidation that ships.
 *
 * WHAT THESE PIN is the pair of properties `translate-wrap.unit.test.ts` and
 * `repair-wrap.unit.test.ts` pin on the two lanes, now on the stage that had
 * neither: only wording the consolidation PRODUCED is wrapped, and whether it
 * still differs from what stands is re-derived from the wrapped text rather
 * than taken from the gate's answer.
 *
 * The demotion case is the one with teeth. The gate compares an unwrapped
 * consolidation against the standing text, so it can call a difference real
 * when the only difference is where the lines break. Shipping that would
 * report a change nobody decided on, and would put a slice through the whole
 * delivery path to arrive at the wording it started with.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
