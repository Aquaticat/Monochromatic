//region Prompt fence
// Choosing a fence no enclosed text can reproduce.
//
// Every stage that interpolates corpus prose or model output into a prompt is
// writing into a destination grammar, not onto a display surface. The enclosed
// text is arbitrary: a setext heading underline is an ordinary row of equals
// signs, and a translation can legitimately contain one. Fenced with a fixed
// delimiter, that text closes its own block and everything after it reads as
// instructions to the model.
//
// Choosing the fence against the content removes the possibility rather than
// making it unlikely. `candidate-select-wire.ts` did this first and privately;
// it lives here now because the introduced-defect probe needs the same
// guarantee, and two copies of a security boundary is one copy too many.
