/**
 Tests for the line an operator watches a repair run by.
 
 WHAT THESE PIN is that the summary cannot drift from the settlement it
 summarises. Every number in the line is a count of something the verdict
 decided, and they arrive as four separate arguments in one sentence, so a
 transposition renders perfectly and reads as an ordinary run. The subject's
 own note says what that costs: a run reads as healthy while shipping
 something else.
 
 The line is emitted at `info` and never returned, so nothing downstream can
 catch a wrong one; this file is where it is read.

 WHY "UNCHANGED" NOW SAYS WHICH (ledger L12). The word covered three
 settlements: the archive beat the patch on the measurements, the patch won
 and wrote no byte, and the patch won and was refused for dropping a declared
 name. The log could not tell a lost repair from one that wrote nothing.
 
 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
