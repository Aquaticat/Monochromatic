// and the page the candidate would replace, each read by the grammar the
// slice's syntax calls for.
//
// ONE DEFINITION OF WHETHER THE FLOOR CAN COMPARE ANYTHING, because two kinds
// of reader ask. The floor (`translate-validate.ts`,
// `front-matter-translation.ts`) answers `unknown` where it cannot, and the
// translate stage and the consolidation ask no writer where it cannot, since
// on such a slice no candidate can pass (ledger B43, B45).
// Two spellings would eventually disagree, and a slice falling between them
// would be bought and shipped unchecked, or settled without a round the floor
// could have checked.
//
// A SIDE NO GRAMMAR READS IS NOT A CANDIDATE'S FAULT, so no reading here
// throws for one. The front-matter floor read both sides inside the try that
// guards the candidate's YAML, and charged a refusal of the original's or the
// page's YAML to whatever the candidate wrote (ledger B44).
