import { isLineStructured, } from './line-structure.ts';

//region Line structure inheritance
// Decides the line-structure fact ONCE PER CHUNK and hands it to every slice
// carved from that chunk.
//
// WHY THE UNIT IS THE CHUNK. `isLineStructured` reads the median length of a
// slice's blank-line separated blocks, and refuses to answer at all below five
// blocks, because under that a stanza is indistinguishable from a short
// paragraph. Subdivision routinely leaves fewer. Asking the predicate about each
// slice therefore does not ask a harder question, it asks an ANSWERABLE question
// of an unanswerable input, and gets false every time.
//
// MEASURED on `Toka_ls`, the entry whose editor fabricated three lines: its
// verse chunk trips the predicate at 21 blocks, median 22, then subdivides into
// seven slices of which ONE still trips it. Four of the remaining six sit at
// medians 20, 22, 23 and 29, inside the same verse range, and fail only for want
// of a fifth block. Deciding per slice dropped the instruction on six sevenths
// of the verse it was written for, and the resulting run still added five lines.
//
// Subdivision is the pipeline's own choice. It cannot change whether the
// original is verse, so it must not change what the editor is told about it.
