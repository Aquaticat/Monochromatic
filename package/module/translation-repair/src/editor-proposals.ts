// Provenance is the whole point of this file. Selection discounts a judge's
// ballot for text that judge produced, and it decides that by asking which
// models a candidate is credited to. Dropping a duplicate proposal rather than
// merging its author into the survivor therefore did not just lose a name: it
// let every model after the first vote at FULL weight for its own words, on
// exactly the envelopes where the ensemble agreed.
