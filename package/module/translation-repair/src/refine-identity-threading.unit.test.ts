/**
 Tests that the repair driver's refinement STEP hands the declared-name block
 down to the sheet the rewriters actually read.
 
 WHY A SEPARATE FILE FROM `refine-window-threading.unit.test.ts`. That one
 drives `runRefinePhase`, one layer below this. The link measured missing here
 is `refineSettledSlices`, the wrapper the repair driver calls, and every case
 in that file passes whether or not this wrapper forwards anything: it calls
 the phase itself.
 
 WHAT WAS MEASURED. On 2026-08-25, inverting this wrapper's conditional spread
 so the identity block is forwarded only when it is ABSENT failed no test in
 this package. The rewriters would then be asked to improve how a memorial
 page reads while being told nothing about which names and handles must
 survive exactly, which is the protection the declared-names guard puts there.
 
 THE FAILURE MODE IS INVISIBLE TO EVERY OTHER KIND OF TEST, for the reason
 already found once: the block is an optional property spread into an object
 literal, TypeScript does not excess-property-check a spread, and the sheet
 still renders without it. A wrapper that forwarded nothing compiled, linted
 and passed its own suite while asking the models a strictly smaller question.
 
 BOTH DIRECTIONS ARE PINNED. A document declaring nothing must get no block at
 all rather than an empty heading, so the case that asserts the heading is
 present is read against a control that asserts it is absent; without the
 control, a wrapper that pasted the heading unconditionally would pass.
 
 NO NETWORK. The client scripts the rewriter, the judges and the probe, and
 records every rewriter sheet.
 
 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
