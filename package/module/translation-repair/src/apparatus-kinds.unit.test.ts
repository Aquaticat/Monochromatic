/**
 Guards ledger S5: every sheet that files, votes on or keeps page apparatus
 reads one list of its kinds.

 Before the shared list, the critic named citations, credits, identifying
 glosses and translator notes; the panel named the same four; the contest named
 a name, a spelled-out referent, a gloss and a translator note; the writers'
 clause named glosses, notes, asides, referents, credits and a citation's
 translator; the archive block review named a credit and a citation. A kind
 missing from one list read to that sheet as an addition, so an explanatory
 aside the writers kept was a defect to the critic, and a spelled-out referent
 the contest kept was an addition to the panel.

 The critic and panel sheets also licensed accurate added detail without the
 narrative bound the contest and the writers carried, so an invented event
 could pass there as "accurate detail a translator added". The archive block
 review and the introduced-defect probe still listed the kinds without it
 (ledger B28).

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention.
