/**
 * Tests for the Charm Hyper balance reader.
 *
 * THE FINITE CHECK IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS. Every other case here refuses a
 * body that is plainly wrong, but a non-finite balance would compare against
 * every threshold as though the budget were unlimited, which is the single
 * outcome this reader exists to prevent: a run that keeps buying because it
 * believes it can.
