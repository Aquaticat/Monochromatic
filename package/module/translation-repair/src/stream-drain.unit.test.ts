/**
 Tests for the stream drain, at the boundary where a call is actually ended.

 The composition layer is tested in `stream-runaway-watch.unit.test.ts`. What
 is tested here is the thing that matters to a running pipeline: that a
 degenerating call STOPS, rather than that something correctly formed an
 opinion about it. A verdict nobody acts on ends nothing, and the provider
 ends nothing either.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
