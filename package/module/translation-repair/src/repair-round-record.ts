//region Repair judged round
// The repair lane's ballots, kept so this lane's reasoning can be READ.
//
// The translate lane has recorded every ballot with its reason since it was
// built, in `TranslateStageResult.ballots` beside the slate that makes a
// position joinable. The repair lane recorded none: `selectPerEnvelope`,
// `selectChunkPatch` and the refinement stage each threw `SelectionOutcome`'s
// `ballots`, `perCandidate` and `selectedIndex` away and kept only counts. So
// the one stage that can silently delete a person's name from a translation
// was also the one stage whose reasoning left no trace, and the defect behind
// `declared-name-survival.ts` could only be found by running a live probe
// against the real sheet.
//
// DECLINES ARE RECORDED TOO, on the same footing as wins. A round where the
// judges refused every proposal is evidence about the judges, and that probe's
// third round was exactly a decline; keeping only `kind: 'selected'` would drop
// the half of the record that says the panel could not agree.
//
// THE INCUMBENT IS NOT ON THESE BALLOTS. In the translate lane the archive text
// is a candidate and its slate entry carries an `origin`, because judges decide
// whether to keep it. Here that comparison is deterministic, made against
// checker verdicts in `select-candidate.ts`, so no judged round in this lane
// sees the unchanged text. `RepairSlateEntry.producer` still carries the kind,
// so a reader never has to assume it.
