// THE RECOVERY ROUND RE-ASKS AN ANSWER NOTHING COULD READ WITH A COMPLAINT
// NAMING WHAT HAPPENED (`stage-quorum.ts`), and two different things happen
// (ledger P10, 2026-09-28). A reply the length limit stopped ran out of room,
// almost always while still reasoning: of the replies cut at their cap since
// the caps went on the wire, 74 of 75 deepseek-v4.1-flash replies on Hyper and
// 185 of 197 Qwen3.8-27B replies on Synthetic streamed no content at all. The
// round told every such model its reply "did not match the required response
// shape", which names a fault it did not make and says nothing of the one it
// did. Every other unreadable answer arrived whole and missed the shape.
//
// EACH WORDING IS A PROMPT OF ITS OWN. `promptUniqueClient` answers a model
// and prompt it has seen from its claims, so both recovery wordings and the
// cross-provider re-ask's (`nudged-reask.ts`) must differ, or one would be
// answered with the reply that already failed.
//
// PROSE, NOT A PARAMETER. Asking a model cut short to keep its working brief
// is text in the prompt; no reasoning control goes on the wire, by the owner's
// standing instruction of 2026-08-25.

/**
 Every reason nothing could read an answer that arrived, in the order the
 recovery round asks them.

 `cut-short` is a reply the length limit stopped before it was complete
 (`truncated-completion` or `truncated-thinking`). `off-shape` is every other
 unreadable answer: one that did not parse, one the guard refused, or one
 that read as a refusal.

 @example
 ```ts
 const groups = UNREADABLE_CAUSES.map(function seatsWith(cause,) { return cause; },);
 ```
 */
export const UNREADABLE_CAUSES = [
  'cut-short',
  'off-shape',
] as const;

/**
 Why nothing could read an answer that arrived; see `UNREADABLE_CAUSES`.

 @example
 ```ts
 const cause: UnreadableCause = 'cut-short';
 ```
 */
export type UnreadableCause = typeof UNREADABLE_CAUSES[number];

/**
 What the recovery round adds to the prompt of a model whose answer arrived
 whole but off the shape asked for.

 THE COMPLAINT IS THE ROUND'S WHOLE VALUE. `promptUniqueClient` answers a
 second call for the same model and prompt from its cache, schema mismatch
 included, so a recovery round that re-sent the same bytes was answered with
 the same unreadable bytes in 0 to 1 ms on every one of the five occasions
 measured across two passes on 2026-09-02 (`#473`). The guard here is a type
 predicate and carries no message of its own, so the complaint names the
 failure in general terms: the answer arrived and its shape was not the one
 asked for. That is enough to make the digest new and to tell the model what
 to do differently. Worded as it was before ledger P10 split it by cause, so
 a stored payload for such a re-ask still replays.
