 Settles a chunk on the patch that ships, logging its refusal and its
 settlement line.

 @param sliceIndex - slice being settled

 @param declaredNames - name forms the patch may not drop

 @param targetText - archive wording of the chunk

 @param shipped - editor result as it ships, after any strip

 @param appliedEnvelopes - what the shipped patch's envelopes bought

 @param tallies - checker verdicts on the shipped patch, by issue id

 @param envelopes - envelopes the patch was written against

 @param targetDocument - archive parsed, the grammar baseline

 @param acceptedCount - issues the panel accepted

 @param unenvelopedCount - accepted issues no envelope could serve

 @param l - chunk logger

 @returns The settlement and the refusal
