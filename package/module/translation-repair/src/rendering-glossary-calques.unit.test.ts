/**
 Guards class one hundred twenty-five (shi_Yumiaoya25, 2026-09-25): under the
 owner's standing instruction of 2026-09-25 ("whenever you see anything that
 can be translated better do it"), two calques on the page join the rendering
 glossary. 滑档二本 shipped as "slid down into a second-tier admission slot",
 where the English is that she missed her chosen schools and ended up at a
 second-tier university. Each form appears once in the pinned corpus, on
 that page. The class also seeded 用这种方式 ("using this way to tell"); the
 glossary audit of 2026-09-27 took it out, a construction rather than a word,
 for the idiomatic English rule (`glossary-dictionary-terms.unit.test.ts`).

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
