//region Line structure addendum
// Turns the computed line-structure fact into the sentence the editor is given.
// Split from `repair-chunk` because it is a pure text decision and that file is
// at its line budget.
//
// DECIDED BY THE CALLER, on the enclosing CHUNK, not here on the slice. See
// `buildEditorAddendum` for why the unit matters more than the predicate.

/**
 * Instruction added when the source slice is line-structured.
 *
 * STATED AS A FACT rather than as a condition the model must evaluate. The
 * standing rule already asks the editor to recognise line-structured text
 * itself, and an attempt to write that same recognition as a heuristic failed
 * its positive control, so leaving the judgement to a model is not obviously
 * safer than measuring it.
 *
 * SPEAKS ABOUT THE ORIGINAL, because that is the side the predicate reads. An
 * earlier wording opened `This region's CURRENT TEXT IS line-structured`, which
 * on the case this exists for is false: `Toka_ls`'s verse chunk is 21 source
 * blocks at median 22 against 18 target blocks at median 101. It told the
 * editor something untrue about the text in front of it, and then asked for one
 * output line per INPUT line, which on an already-merged translation asks for
 * the merged shape to be preserved.
 *
 * NAMES THE OBSERVED FAILURE rather than only the desired shape. The editor did
 * not merely reflow `Toka_ls`: it replaced three correctly translated lines with
 * invented text, one of them with a correct translation of a DIFFERENT line.
 * Forbidding reflow would not have covered that, so both are stated.

const LINE_STRUCTURE_RULE = 'This region\'s ORIGINAL IS line-structured: each '

/**
 * Builds the editor rule addendum for one slice.
 *
 * TAKES THE VERDICT, DOES NOT COMPUTE IT, because the slice is the wrong unit to
 * compute it on. `isLineStructured` needs at least five blocks before it will
 * answer anything but false, and slicing cuts a verse section into pieces
 * smaller than that. Measured on `Toka_ls`: the verse chunk is line-structured
 * at 21 blocks, median 22, and subdivides into seven slices of which ONE still
 * trips the predicate. Four of the other six sit at medians 20, 22, 23 and 29,
 * squarely inside the verse range, and fail only for want of a fifth block.
 *
 * So the caller decides on the enclosing chunk and every slice carved from it
 * inherits the answer. Subdivision is the pipeline's own choice and cannot
 * change whether the original is verse.
 *
 * @param baseAddendum - configured addendum, possibly empty
 *
 * @param lineStructured - whether the enclosing chunk's ORIGINAL is
 * line-structured; measured on the source because the translation may already
 * have merged the lines that make it verse, and on `Toka_ls` the Chinese chunk
 * sits at median 22 against the English rendering's 101
 *
 * @returns Addendum, empty when there is nothing to add
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const addendum = buildEditorAddendum({ baseAddendum: '', lineStructured: true, },);
 * ```
