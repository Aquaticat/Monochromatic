// Without this the join is not merely awkward, it is impossible. Sheet items
// are numbered positions; probe telemetry and checker verdicts are keyed by
// issue id; and the sheets deliberately print no issue id, because a 64-hex
// string on a grading sheet is noise a human has to read past. Re-running the
// draw does not recover the mapping either: the draw is deterministic in its
// seed but not in its POOL, and the pool grows with every entry that settles,
// so a draw taken at fifteen entries stops reproducing as soon as the sixteenth
// lands.
//
// So the mapping exists only in the instant the sheets are written, and if it
// is not written down then, every measurement that needs to join a human grade
// to a machine verdict is lost with it. That includes the whole reason the
// introduced-defect probe records anything.
//
// Identifiers only, no corpus text: this file lives beside the sheets, outside
// git, under the same rule they do.
