/**
 Guards against a count printed before a fixed plural (ledger B98): a report
 line wrote `${String(count,)} slices` and printed "1 slices", and a test
 pinned one such line as correct. Widened (ledger B109) to also
 guard a count before one or two adjectives and then a fixed plural
 ("1 cached slices"), which the original scan could not see. The package
 chooses the noun a count takes with `wordForCount` (`count-word.ts`).

 WHAT THE SCAN READS, in the package's source (tests and their fixtures are
 left out): every template literal where a `String(...)` interpolation is
 followed, after one space, by up to three words (letters and hyphens), where
 the first, second or third is a counted noun: a word the package already
 counts, that is the `many` form of some `wordForCount` call in the source,
 so the noun list grows as nouns are counted, AND is itself shaped like a
 plain plural (one lowercase word, hyphens allowed, ending in "s"). That
 shape is what tells a true counted noun ("slices") apart from a `many` form
 written for subject-verb agreement ("are", "were", "go", "survive", "sit",
 "follow", "carry") or a full sentence fragment ("entries that are",
 "headings of slices"): neither ends a count-and-noun phrase, and excluding
 them by shape, rather than by naming them, is what keeps "cache records are"
 and "of them are" from reading as counted nouns. A candidate word that is a
 preposition or determiner ("of", "these", "them") ends the read right there,
 since what follows is not a modifier of the count but a reference elsewhere
 ("N of these artifacts"); a modifier is letters and hyphens, its first
 letter capital or not, so a proper adjective such as "Latin" in "Latin
 tokens" is read as one. A word
 followed by `=` is a log field's name and is passed over. Reads are keyed
 `path#site: word` for a direct count-then-noun, or `path#site: modifiers
 noun` when one or two words sit between (the words exactly as printed,
 space-joined), where the site is the nearest enclosing named function or
 class (so a count inside a class's constructor keys to the class name, not
 to the module, which keeps two constructors in one file from sharing an
 exemption key). Out of the scan's reach: a noun after another interpolation,
 a noun after more than two modifier words, a modifier capitalized past its
 first letter, a noun split from its count across a `+` between two literals, and
 a noun no `wordForCount` call names yet. The listed exemptions are counts
 that cannot be one, and verbs after an index ("slice 3 claims").

 THE FIXTURE CASE COMES FIRST, so the package-wide case is read against a
 scan shown able to find each form (ledger M21). Fixtures are cat-themed; the
 package case reads this package's own source.
