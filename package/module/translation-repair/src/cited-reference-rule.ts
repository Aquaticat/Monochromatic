// that votes read one rule (`critic-prompt.ts`, `adjudicate-prompt.ts`,
// class thirty-five, 2026-09-16); the sheets that weigh renderings against
// each other read a second (class thirty-six); the rendering audit, which
// files by its own categories against one CANDIDATE, reads a third
// (ledger B29).

 What the references are for and what they are not. Written against the
 Mio19 deletion: four critics reported "older sister who is also trans" as
 an addition because the ORIGINAL does not say it, and the blog the
 ORIGINAL cites does.

 PRECEDENCE IS STATED IN THE RULE (ledger S8): the narrative bound on the same
 sheets calls an event or a characterization the ORIGINAL does not state an
 addition, and neither rule limited reader protection, so a method a cited
 page stated read as accurate detail to keep.
