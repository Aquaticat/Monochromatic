//region Ineligible standing text
// A STANDING TEXT THE DETERMINISTIC GATE HAS ALREADY REFUSED may not ship, and
// may not be offered to the judges as something to keep.
//
// THE OWNER'S DECISION OF 2026-09-04, on the luxuanwen3 pass of that day: the
// archive's front matter broke the identity rule in
// `validateFrontMatterTranslation`, the driver logged "standing text fails
// publication eligibility and remains retryable", the slate judges endorsed
// that standing over two valid proposals (three ballots calling the archive's
// shape "the declared translated identity"), the single attempt shipped it
// "with the finding recorded", and `assertFrontMatterComplete` refused the
// whole entry an hour and 2.61 USD later. Asked whether consolidation should
// refuse to ship a standing the gate had rejected, the owner chose: prefer the
// best valid proposal, else fail the slice at once.
//
// PREFERRING THE BEST VALID PROPOSAL IS DONE BY THE JUDGES, not by a tally of
// ballots cast for the incumbent: the incumbent is simply not on the slate.
// `judgeTranslateSlate` already knows an absent incumbent (a passage the
// archive never carried), and with the standing withheld the judges choose
// among the valid proposals or decline, and a decline is the "else".
//
// THE OWNER'S ADDENDUM OF 2026-09-09, on the sixth Mio pass on Bedrock alone:
// at slice 3 the translate lane's standing failed the gate, the archive's
// paragraph and list for that slice were valid and were never offered, and
// the entry stopped. Asked whether to keep the incumbent for that slice or
// stop, the owner chose to keep it: `readStandingVerdict` reads the gate's
// verdict on the incumbent (`row.incumbentText`, the page text the slice
// replaces) beside the standing's, and where the standing is ineligible and
// the incumbent passes, the settlement runs against the incumbent as its
// standing, with {@link INELIGIBLE_STANDING_REPLACED_FINDING} recorded and no
// contest endorsement, so the single-attempt rule ships it with the
// non-endorsement recorded if the judges keep it. The entry stops only where
// the incumbent is ineligible too, or where the standing IS the incumbent
// (luxuanwen3, where the two were one).
//
// THIS IS NOT THE NO-LOOP DECISION REOPENED. `consolidate-slice-buy.ts` keeps
// its single attempt for a standing that merely lacks contest ENDORSEMENT;
// that standing has passed the deterministic gate and quality machinery may
// not withhold the entry over it. A standing that has NOT passed the gate was
// never going to ship, and the page guard was going to say so after the run
// had been paid for.
//
// THE OWNER'S RULING OF 2026-09-27 REPLACES "ELSE FAIL THE SLICE AT ONCE":
// asked whether an entry keeps stopping where no wording for a slice passes
// the rule, given that a stopped entry leaves the archive's whole page live,
// that slice included, the owner chose "Keep archive, ship". Every exit that
// stopped the entry now settles through {@link keepTheArchive}: the slice
// keeps exactly what the archive has there, nothing where it is silent, the
// page ships with every other repair, and the publish step reports the slice.
// The first half of the 2026-09-04 rule stands, so a valid proposal is still
// preferred wherever one exists.

/**
 Ships the proposal the slate chose past a gate that settled on neither
 rendering, when the standing it would otherwise keep is ineligible.

 CLASS FIFTY-FOUR (XingZ604 slice 13, 2026-09-18): the archive's paragraph
 and the contest winner both carried the original's neutral pronoun
 untranslated, the standing was withheld from the slate, the slate judges
 chose a valid proposal 3 of 4, and the gate went 5 of 7 usable with neither
 rendering at quorum. The gate's rule that indecision keeps the standing
 text is a conservative default, and with an ineligible standing there is
 nothing conservative to keep: the entry stopped at 4h53m over a text the
 judges had already endorsed. The owner's 2026-09-04 rule prefers the best
 valid proposal.

 CLASS ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY-SEVEN (TianqiChen66610 slice 13, owner answer
 2026-09-26: "Slate's choice"). The standing was eligible, but every contest
 ballot had called it flawed; the class one hundred six run-off ran, the slate
 chose a valid proposal, and the gate tied 2 to 2, so the condemned archive
 shipped. A standing the whole contest condemned is no conservative default
 either, so the same indecision ships the slate's choice there too.

 CLASS ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY-FIVE (TianqiChen66619 slice 9, 2026-09-27). The
 gate preferred an ineligible standing 2 of 4 over the slate's valid choice,
 and the entry stopped. The class fifty-four note had kept that stop ("a
 gate that refuses the consolidation by quorum still keeps the standing"),
 which read the owner's "else fail the slice at once" as covering a gate's
 preference; the rule fails the slice only where no valid proposal exists,
 and a standing the deterministic rule refused cannot ship whatever the gate
 thinks of it. So a gate that prefers an ineligible standing ships the
 slate's choice too, with the finding naming the preference; an eligible
 standing the gate prefers still ships as before.
