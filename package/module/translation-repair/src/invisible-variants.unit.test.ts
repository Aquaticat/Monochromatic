/**
 * Tests for folding invisible variants out of a model's text.
 *
 * WHAT THESE PIN: the non-breaking hyphen the reading found becomes a hyphen
 * and is named; spaces and joiners fold to what a reader would type; visible
 * typography the archive itself uses passes through untouched; and a text with
 * nothing to fold comes back byte-identical with no finding.
 *
 * EVERY FIXTURE IS SPELLED AS AN ESCAPE. The first version of this file wrote
 * the characters themselves, and the tool that wrote it dropped two of them,
 * which is exactly the invisibility the fold exists to catch.
 *
 * Fixtures are a sentence about a bookshop cat, so there is no corpus text here.
 *
