/**
 Guards class one hundred sixteen (zheermao11, 2026-09-24): the translator
 sheet shows WHAT THE PICTURES HERE SAY for the pictures in and beside a
 passage, and said nothing about what the block is for, so the writers
 rendered a neighbouring picture's transcript into a passage whose ORIGINAL
 is a picture component or a sentence introducing the picture. Every such
 candidate ran past the produced volume bound and was cut (22 of the run's
 translate streams, 31 to 43 on every earlier zheermao run), and on a run
 with the reasoning seats reachable each cut came after 60 to 170 seconds
 of thinking, so the translate lane took 616 seconds against 77. The sheet
 now says the block is context and scopes a transcript to the passages that
 already carry one.

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
