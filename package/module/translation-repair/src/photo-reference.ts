//region Photo reference
// WHICH IMAGES A PASSAGE SHOWS, so a stage can be handed the picture rather
// than only the markup that names it.
//
// `#111` supplies the image to translators and judges, so a passage transcribed
// from one has a source that can be CHECKED rather than only preserved. The
// asset is already named in the markdown, so finding it is path work rather
// than a new corpus reader.
//
// ONE FORM, MEASURED. Across the pinned corpus the only image reference in any
// page is `<PhotoScroll photos={[ ... ]} />`, 173 occurrences, naming 380 assets
// of which 376 are `.webp` and 4 are `.jpg`. There are no markdown image
// references and no `<img>` elements, so this reader deliberately understands
// one construct rather than markdown's whole image vocabulary.
//
// TWO QUOTE MARKS, MEASURED LATER. At pin `a41fc607` the source pages write 199
// asset paths: 192 in single quotes across 47 entries and 7 in double quotes
// across 4 (`yulianNyanner`, `MTF_0615`, `Arita`, `BI4PBV`), and nothing in any
// third form. Until 2026-09-04 this reader took single-quoted strings only, and
// the first OpenRouter-alone BI4PBV pass (04:28 UTC) went through its picture
// stage in one millisecond: four pictures referenced, none gathered, none read,
// and no line saying so, because `assertVisualEvidenceComplete` asks this same
// reader what the slices show. An undercount here is the quiet kind.
//
// THE PLACEHOLDER IS THE ENTRY. Every reference is written `${path}/photos/…`,
// where `${path}` stands for the entry's own directory. One reference in the
// corpus writes `${path} /photos/…` with a stray space, so the prefix is matched
// with whitespace tolerated rather than as a fixed string: a reader that missed
// that one asset would report an entry as having fewer images than it shows.
//
// NO REGEX, per `RG1`: the rule is "inside a PhotoScroll element, take every
// quoted string, closed by the mark that opened it", which a scan states
// directly and in one pass.
