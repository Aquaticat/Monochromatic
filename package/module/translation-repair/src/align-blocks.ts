// Paragraph pairing used to assume that equal node counts mean one-to-one
// correspondence, and `slice-pair.ts` said so outright: "When both sides carry
// the same node count their paragraphs correspond one to one ... never
// drifting." The pinned corpus disproves it. One entry carries 32 blocks on
// each side, yet its translation drops a short lead-in paragraph and folds the
// line into the quotation that follows, so from that point every index-paired
// slice compares a block against its neighbour. Equal totals hid the drift
// because the translation regains a block further down.
//
// Critics then behave exactly as asked: handed two unrelated blocks, they
// report differences between them. Those become confident, well-anchored, and
// entirely false issues, which is how milestone three's graded sample scored
// its single largest false-positive cluster.
//
// This is a monotone alignment that may skip a block on either side instead of
// forcing a partner. Scoring is deliberately language-neutral, since the whole
// point is pairing Chinese against English before any model has read either:
// block kind, shared script-neutral tokens (Latin words, digit runs, component
// names), and a plausible length ratio.

/**
 Characters a Chinese block typically becomes in English, used only when the
 pair itself gives no better estimate. Chinese is written without spaces and
 packs more meaning per character, so an English rendering runs longer; this
 judges plausibility and never rejects.
 
 A FIXED CONSTANT IS WRONG FOR THIS CORPUS, measured 2026-08-20. Entry medians
 of English characters per Chinese character run from 1.49 to 4.10, because how
 far a translation expands is a property of the TRANSLATOR, not of the language
 pair: a plain rendering stays close and a literary one runs long.
 
 On `saurikissa`, whose median is 4.10, every CORRECT pair scored as implausible
 against 1.8, which destroyed the only signal the walk had. Chinese and English
 prose share no Latin tokens, and block kind is constant when every block is a
 paragraph, so length was carrying the alignment alone and pointing the wrong
 way. Six of eleven slices then paired unrelated paragraphs.
 `doc/audit/the-critics-are-shown-the-wrong-paragraph.md` records the reading.

 unrelated blocks. A scan rather than a pattern: the rule is "runs of Latin
 letters and digits", which an index walk states directly and runs in one pass
 with no backtracking on adversarial input. The runs took ASCII letters and
 digits only until ledger B18, which cut every accented word at its accent.
