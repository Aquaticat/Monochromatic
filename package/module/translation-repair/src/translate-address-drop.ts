//region Second-person address the passage carries
// CLASS NINETY-SEVEN (yingying5, 2026-09-23). The original's closing wish
// addresses the deceased directly (愿在你的下一个世界……), the archive wrote
// it in the third person, the repair lane wrote "you" and the translate lane
// copied the archive; the contest tied two to two, the archive's line stood,
// and the gate kept it over the consolidated "you" with one ballot reading
// the Chinese as "she". yingying1 to 4 had shipped the second person. A
// pronoun the ORIGINAL writes is rendered as written where it stands (class
// eighty-one), and a rendering that turns 你 into she or they is refused
// before any judge reads it, as a dropped marker is (class ninety-two). THE
// FLOOR IS NARROW: a greeting (你好) addresses nobody, and a rendering that
// carries no pronoun at all ("Ah, wanna play?" for 干干你的) is left to the
// judges; only a rendering with no second-person pronoun and a third-person
// one in its place fails. The corpus census of 2026-09-23 found 67 of 92
// archive pages carrying 你, and of 31 aligned blocks six without "you": four
// greetings, colloquial drops or misalignments and two person switches.
//
// LEDGER F-1 (2026-09-27): read block by block where the texts have as many
// blocks, and "in its place" means a third-person pronoun beyond the ones the
// original writes there; `translate-address-original.ts` reads the original.
// Replayed over 1,264 archive slices and 3,975 would-ship slices, refusals
// fell from 25 to 13 with none added. THE COUNT HAS A LIMIT: English writes
// pronouns Chinese leaves out, so a block whose 你 is generic ("逼着你干",
// "makes you do") beside a subject-dropped description can still show a
// surplus with no switch in it (lintong slice 1 is the one left).
