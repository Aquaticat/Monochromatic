/**
 Tests that the settlement line a repair run logs says which kind of
 "unchanged" a slice settled on, read through the settlement that writes it
 (ledger L12).

 WHY THROUGH THE SETTLEMENT. `repair-chunk-settlement-line.unit.test.ts` pins
 the sentence for each state, and nothing there reads whether the settlement
 hands the line the verdict it reached: a settlement passing a constant would
 log "the archive won" for every lost, empty or refused patch, and every line
 would still read as an ordinary run.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
