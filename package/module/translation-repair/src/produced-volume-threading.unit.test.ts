/**
 * Tests that `#184`'s produced-volume bound REACHES THE WIRE on every producing
 * call the translate lane makes, the re-ask included.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS SEPARATE FROM `produced-volume-bound.unit.test.ts`. That one hands
 * `maxAnswerChars` straight to `drainBody` and watches the drain refuse, which
 * proves the LAST hop and nothing above it. Between the producer and the drain
 * the bound crosses five boundaries as an OPTIONAL field forwarded by
 * conditional spread: quorum, round, call, client, transport. Delete any one of
 * those spreads and the code still compiles, the whole suite still passes, and
 * production silently returns to the state `#184` existed to end, where the
 * seam exists and nothing passes anything through it. Only a test that reads
 * what the CLIENT was handed can see that.
 *
 * THE SECOND THING IT PINS IS THE PRODUCING RE-ASK. An invalid candidate is
 * sent back to its author for a fresh rendering of the same slice, which is a
 * producing call by every measure that matters, and it was left unbounded when
 * `#184` landed. It is also the busiest one: measured over 32 artifacts, the
 * re-ask fired on 96 of 175 slices.
 *
 * NO NETWORK. The client is a stub scripting one invalid rendering and one
 * revision, recording every request it is handed.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention mirroring corpus structure only.
