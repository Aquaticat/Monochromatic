/**
 What the package's own root logger warned, or logged at the info level,
 while one piece of work ran, for cases whose reader takes no logger and
 writes through its module's root.

 TEST SUPPORT, NOT PACKAGE SOURCE. The built package carries its own logger,
 whose console sink looks `console.warn` and `console.info` up by name at
 each write, so the divert here is what it calls. That logger is flushed
 through a root the build itself hands out before the diverted method is put
 back: a line still waiting on a sink when the divert ended would be printed
 instead of kept.

 THE LOGGER STARTS BEFORE THE DIVERT (ledger B140). It is built on a
 process's first line and verifies its sinks then, and it reports a sink it
 could not verify on `console.warn` itself, untagged. Started inside the
 divert, that report was read as one of the work's lines and refused: a file
 sink slow to verify under load put it there five seconds into a case. Flushed
 first, the logger finishes verifying before `console.warn` is replaced, and
 its report reaches the console it was written for.

 SO DOES THE TEST FRAMEWORK'S LOGGER. The build bundles its own copy of the
 logger, so a test process holds a second one: module-logger's default
 logger, which the test framework writes through and which reports its sinks
 the same way. It starts on the framework's first line, before any case, and
 a verify that ran past its time limit would report into whatever divert was
 open by then. That timing was not reproduced; flushing it here waits its
 verification out before the divert opens, whenever it started.

 A CASE CALLING THIS RUNS ONE AT A TIME: the divert is process-wide and held
 across an await, so every suite around the case sets `concurrency: 1`
 (`global-writes-sequenced.unit.test.ts`).
