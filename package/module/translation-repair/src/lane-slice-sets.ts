//region Lane slice sets
// The slices a lane NAMES as something other than decided, and the five checks
// each of those lists has to pass.
//
// Three such lists exist, and they arrived one at a time: unfilled, then
// unheard, then not-applicable. Each was written as its own loop against the
// preparation, and by the third the loops were the same five checks with the
// wording changed, which is how the pairwise disjointness between them came to
// be checked in one direction only.
//
// So the checks live here once and the lists differ by DATA: what each is
// called, what it says when a slice is named twice, and which side of the
// archive it belongs to. That last one is the check worth having: every list
// here is only legal at one kind of slice, and getting it wrong is how an
// exemption list becomes a way around the coverage rule.
