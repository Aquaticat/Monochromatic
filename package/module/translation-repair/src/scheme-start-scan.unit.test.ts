/**
 Tests for the search both address scans share: where the next web scheme
 starts in a text.

 WHAT THESE PIN: the answer is the first place at or after the cursor where a
 whole scheme starts, whichever scheme it is; a stem that opens no scheme is
 passed over; and the text's length stands for "none". The two readers that
 call it (`corpus-run/dropped-destinations.ts`, `cited-reference-scan.ts`)
 pin what they make of a run in their own files.

 NO CASE TIMES THE SEARCH. That it costs time in proportion to the text was
 measured apart from the suite, since a clock in a case fails on a busy
 machine and proves nothing on a quiet one.

 Fixtures are invented addresses and words about a cat.
