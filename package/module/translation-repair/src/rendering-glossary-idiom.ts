// CLASS ONE HUNDRED THIRTY (shi_Yumiaoya31, 2026-09-25): 三剑客汽车节目
// shipped as "the Three Musketeers car show", 燃油车 as "a fuel-powered car",
// 喘不过气 as "left her breathless", 密密麻麻的伤痕 as "densely packed scars",
// 志愿填写 as "her application preferences", 命运的齿轮 as "the gears of fate",
// 相关医院 as "the relevant hospitals", 巨大的影响 as "an enormous influence on
// her death" and 贴贴计划 as "her cuddling plan". Every term appears in the
// pinned corpus on that entry alone. Kept beside `rendering-glossary.ts`, which
// spreads these entries into `RENDERING_GLOSSARY`, so neither file outgrows the
// line budget.
//
// THE GLOSSARY AUDIT OF 2026-09-27 took out 相关医院 and 巨大的影响, two
// ordinary words joined by one sentence (the lesson, a filler word English
// does without, is the idiomatic English rule of `english-usage-policy.ts`),
// and dropped the refused forms of 三剑客, 喘不过气 and 密密麻麻 that are the
// right English for the same word elsewhere: any famous trio is "the Three
// Musketeers", a runner is "out of breath", writing is "densely packed".
/**
 Idioms and set phrases the pinned corpus carries whose word-for-word
 rendering reads badly in English, with the English the page uses.
