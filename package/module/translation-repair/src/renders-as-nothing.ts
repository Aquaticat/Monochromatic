// WHETHER A TEXT SHOWS A READER ANYTHING, asked one way wherever a model's
// wording or reason must say something (ledger B40). The checks it replaces
// asked `trim()`, which answers a different question: it removes the
// ECMAScript whitespace and keeps every invisible character that is not
// whitespace. A translator's reply of one zero-width space (U+200B), word
// joiner (U+2060) or soft hyphen (U+00AD) passed the wire guard and the slate
// filter that way, and the intake fold (`invisible-variants.ts`) then removed
// its every character, so an empty candidate reached the judges. A reply of
// one Hangul filler (U+3164) is not folded at all, and the deterministic
// floor passes it over an original that says something.
//
// NOTHING, HERE, IS WHAT UNICODE SAYS RENDERS AS NOTHING: White_Space;
// Default_Ignorable_Code_Point, which Unicode derives from the format
// characters, the variation selectors and the fillers, less White_Space
// (`DerivedCoreProperties.txt`, Unicode 18.0.0); and the controls (Cc), which
// no page shows as text. Every character the intake fold removes is
// default-ignorable, and every one it turns into a space is White_Space, so a
// text this calls something still says something after the fold.

/* oxlint-disable no-restricted-syntax/no-regex -- the input is one code point, anchored at both ends with one class and no quantifier, so the test is bounded and cannot backtrack; Unicode White_Space and Default_Ignorable_Code_Point have no string API */

 @param text - wording or reason as a model wrote it, before or after the

 @returns Whether no character of it is visible

 ```ts

 ```
