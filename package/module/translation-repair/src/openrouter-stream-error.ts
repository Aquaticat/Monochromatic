//region OpenRouter in-stream error
// A PROVIDER FAILURE THAT ARRIVES AS A SUCCESS. OpenRouter answers a chat
// completion with HTTP 200 and starts the event stream before the upstream
// has answered; when the upstream then fails, the gateway cannot change the
// status it already sent, so it writes one chunk carrying an `error` object
// (`{"code":504,"message":"error code: 504","metadata":{"error_type":
// "timeout"}}`, captured 2026-09-04) and closes the stream without `[DONE]`.
//
// WHAT THAT LOOKED LIKE BEFORE THIS READER. `requireStreamTerminator` saw
// no terminator and threw "stream ended without its [DONE] terminator; the
// reply was cut off": a true statement about the framing and a wrong
// diagnosis of the cause. On 2026-09-04, 114 of the day's 115 such failures
// were MiniMax M3 served by ModelRun, each a body of 846 characters that
// "completed" after about 10.5 seconds with no content, and a direct probe
// of that endpoint reproduced the frame on the fourth of six calls. The
// retry ladder handled every one as a truncated reply, which is the right
// action for the wrong reason, and the run log named no endpoint and no
// code, so the endpoint's failure rate (119 of 300 streams that day) had to
// be reconstructed from the raw-character count.
//
// NAMES, NEVER THE BODY. The gateway's error message is free text from the
// upstream; this reader carries the numeric code, the gateway's error type
// and the endpoint's display name, which is what an operator needs to act
// and nothing a run log must not hold.
//
// A SECOND SHAPE, 2026-09-08: a stream that closes its choice with
// `finish_reason: "error"`, carries no error object and does send `[DONE]`.
// `openrouter-error-finish.ts` records that class; this reader asks it when
// no chunk carried an error object, so both shapes throw the same failure.
