/**
 * Tests for what the translate lane's judges are told.
 *
 * WHY A SHEET OF CONSTANTS IS WORTH PINNING. These strings are the only thing
 * standing between a judge and the wrong reading of `nothing added`. Measured on
 * one contested slice, three of six judges rejected a candidate for carrying a
 * declared alias, every one of them having been shown the declared names. The
 * separate names criterion did not stop them, because it reads as spelling
 * guidance while `nothing added` reads as a rule. Losing the carve-out again
 * would cost accurate detail on memorial pages and nothing here would fail.
 *
 * AND THE CARVE-OUT HAS ITS OWN FAILURE MODE, measured on the consolidation
 * bed once it was written without a scope: a judge abstained from a whole slate
 * because no candidate carried the declared LOCATION, and a shipped rendering
 * signed a note left by a friend of the deceased with the deceased's own name,
 * alias and city. Both directions are pinned here, because a sheet edit that
 * fixes one by reopening the other would otherwise pass.
