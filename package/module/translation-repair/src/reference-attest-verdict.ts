// What the check made of each item one voice answered: kept as answered, kept
// under the reference that states it, or dropped with the side not found
// (ledger B25). The reference quote is looked for in what one reference line
// says its page states, so the sheet line credits the page that states the
// detail, a quote cannot run from one page's line into the next, and an address
// or a failure note verifies nothing (ledger B104). An item naming a reference
// that does not state its quote takes the number of the first that does
// rather than losing its vote: the quote was found word for word, and a lost
// vote can cost the detail its quorum, which is the Mio20 loss the cited
// reference rule was written against. The confirmation round still asks the
// bench about every candidate.
