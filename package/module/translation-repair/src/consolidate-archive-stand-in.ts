// standing reads, and where the contest chose neither lane the kept standing
// is that stand-in, which the page must then be written with rather than
// left as the contest found it.

// ONLY WHERE THE STAND-IN MAY STAND (owner answer 2026-09-27, "No eligible

// the archive's own wording stays the incumbent every sheet shows as
