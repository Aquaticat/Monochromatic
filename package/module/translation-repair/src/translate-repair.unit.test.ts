/**
 Tests for what happens to a translated slice that fails structural
 validation.

 By user decision of 2026-08-15 it is not dropped: it goes back to the model
 that wrote it, in the same exchange, and that model answers with a revision,
 an inability, or a defence of what it produced. Each of those three lands
 differently, and the third is the one no filter could have collected, so all
 three are pinned here.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
