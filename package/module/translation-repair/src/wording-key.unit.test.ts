/**
 Tests for which two wordings count as one page (ledger B26).

 WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Every place that decides whether a proposal changes
 anything reads `sameWording`, so what it folds and what it keeps apart is the
 whole contract: a fold too narrow ships a change the page does not show, and
 one too wide throws away a change a reader would see. Each case that folds
 has a neighbour that must not.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
