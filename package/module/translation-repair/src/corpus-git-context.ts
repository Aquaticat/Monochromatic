 The directory git's search for a repository stops at, for one clone, which
 every corpus read resolves once before it starts git and hands to

 THE PARENT OF THE CLONE'S REAL PATH, since git compares the ceiling with its
 real working directory. Where the real path cannot be resolved for a reason
 git's own `-C` meets too, the parent of the path as named stands in: git
 then stops at the directory before reading any ceiling.

 A PARENT WHOSE PATH HOLDS A COLON IS REFUSED. `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES` is a
 colon-separated list with no escape (git 2.55 manual, `git help git`), so
 such a parent splits into two paths, neither of them the parent: measured
 with git 2.55, a plain directory under `a:b` inside a repository read that
 repository's page, and a page absent there read as one absent at a held
 commit, which a walker steps past. A real clone there reads its own pages
 whether or not the ceiling applies, but nothing tells the two apart without
 the ceiling, so both are refused. A link from a path free of colons does
 not help, since the ceiling is taken from the real path.

 @param cloneDir - clone directory as the pin names it

 @returns The parent of the clone's real path, or of the path as named where
 git cannot enter it

 @throws {@link StatedRefusalError} when that parent's path holds a colon,

/**
 Isolates every corpus subprocess from inherited repository routing and grafts,
 and from every credential and setting of the package.
 Guards are assigned after inheritance, so callers cannot override them.
 No process-global environment is mutated or logged.

 EVERY REMOVED NAME IS STATED AS `undefined`, NOT LEFT OUT: `nano-spawn` merges
 this object over the process's own environment, so a name left out came back
 from the parent and `GIT_DIR` reached the child of its listing, while node's
 `execFile` read the same object as replacing the environment.

 GIT SPEAKS THE C LOCALE. A failed corpus read is classified by the English
 words git prints (`corpus-source.ts`), and git translates its messages into
 the caller's language: measured with git 2.55 on a throwaway repository, a
 path absent at a held commit printed `Schwerwiegend: Pfad ... existiert nicht
 in ...` under `LANGUAGE=de` with an English `LANG`, and under `LANG` or
 `LC_MESSAGES` set to German, which the reader classed as another failure.
 `LC_ALL=C` overrides all three, so git prints its own English whatever the
 caller's locale says; the caller's other locale variables are kept as they
 are.

 GIT NEVER CLIMBS OUT OF THE CLONE: `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES` names the
 parent of the directory the clone resolves to ({@link gitSearchCeiling}),
 so a directory
 that is no repository is refused rather than read as whatever repository
 encloses it. Git checks the directory it starts in whatever the list says,
 so the ceiling is the parent and never the clone. Git compares the list with
 its real working directory, so the parent is taken from the clone's real
 path: measured with git 2.55, a clone directory that is itself a link to a
 plain directory inside a repository read that repository's page under a
 ceiling taken from the link's own parent, and was refused under one taken
 from its real path, while a link to a real clone still read.

 @param searchCeiling - directory git's search for a repository stops at,
 as {@link gitSearchCeiling} resolved it for the clone the child reads

 @param environment - inherited process context, injectable for verification
