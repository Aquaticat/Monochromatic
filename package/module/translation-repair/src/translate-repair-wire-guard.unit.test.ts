/**
 * Tests for the guard that admits a repair reply onto the ballot.
 *
 * WHY A SIBLING FILE rather than more children beside
 * `translate-repair-wire.unit.test.ts`: that file reads the SHEET, this one
 * reads the GUARD, and `await describe` throws, so a failure in the first suite
 * of a file aborts the rest before it runs.
 *
 * WHAT WAS MEASURED. On 2026-08-25, making the guard ACCEPT a reply whose
 * `resolution` is not a string at all failed no test in this package. Nothing
 * said the field is required to be one, so a reply carrying a number, an object
 * or nothing there would have reached the union check with a value it cannot
 * name, and the guard's whole job is to keep such a reply off the ballot.
 *
 * EVERY REFUSAL IS PINNED SEPARATELY, since they are the guard: the union is
 * enforced here rather than in the type, per the module's own note, and a
 * revision carrying no translation is not a revision.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
