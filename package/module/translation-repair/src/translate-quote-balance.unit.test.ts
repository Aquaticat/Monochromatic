/**
 Guards class one hundred sixty-five (TianqiChen6665, 2026-09-26): the
 archive's rendering of a three-line final message carried one closing
 quotation mark and no opening one, where the original quotes every line with
 「」, and the page shipped it unendorsed. A closing double quotation mark
 with no opening mark before it is refused where the original's own
 quotation marks close nothing they did not open.

 Class one hundred seventy-five (TianqiChen66610, 2026-09-26): the same
 stray closer shipped as a straight double quote, which the floor left alone
 and the typography restore left straight on its odd count. A straight
 double quote is read by its shape: closing after a word or punctuation,
 opening before one.

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
