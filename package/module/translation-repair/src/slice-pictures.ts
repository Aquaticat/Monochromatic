// WHICH PICTURES ONE SLICE IS SHOWN, and what a stage is told about them.
//
// THE SLICE'S OWN AND ITS NEIGHBOURS'. Measured over the pinned corpus, 79 of
// 1260 slices name a picture on the source side and NONE names one on the target
// side without also naming it on the source, so the source's own references are
// the whole attachment surface. But `Zha_Ke/1` carries 3652 characters
// transcribing a letter that `Zha_Ke/2` names, one slice later, so a slice shown
// only its own pictures would be shown nothing about the one it transcribes.
//
// ONE SECTION EACH WAY, which is the width the fidelity window already uses and
// the width the phenomenon has: measured 2026-08-18 over 92 entries, every
// relocation pair in the corpus is adjacent and the longest run of flagged
// slices anywhere is three.
//
// A REFUSED READING BECOMES A FINDING, NOT A CAVEAT IN THE PROMPT. A stage told
// "there is a picture here and nobody could read it" is being handed a hedge it
// has to weigh, and it has no way to weigh it. It is told about the pictures
// that WERE read, and the run records the rest where a person reads findings.

 * stamp rather than the position and gets the same number by a route that would
 * break loudly if the invariant ever did.

 * once by the stage that windows it for itself, and a second stage reporting the
 * same refusal would have a run count one unread picture twice.
