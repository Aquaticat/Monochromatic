/**
 Guards class ninety-seven (2026-09-23): a candidate that renders
 a passage the original addresses in the second person (你, 您) with no
 second-person pronoun and a third-person one instead is refused before any
 judge reads it, since a pronoun the original writes is rendered as written
 where it stands (class eighty-one). A greeting (你好) is no address, and a
 rendering carrying no pronoun at all is left to the judges. Cat-themed
 invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
