/**
 Guards class one hundred sixty (2026-09-26): under the
 owner's standing instruction of 2026-09-25 ("whenever you see anything that
 can be translated better do it"), three fandom words join the community
 glossary. 头壳, a kigurumi performer's head mask, shipped as "inside her
 head", the wearer's own head; 阿洛娜 and 亚托莉, the characters Arona of
 Blue Archive and Atri of ATRI -My Dear Moments-, shipped as the archive's
 "Alona and Atori", and no candidate on the run wrote the official names.

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
