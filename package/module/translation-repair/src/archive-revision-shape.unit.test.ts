/**
 Tests for the shape floor on an archive block's revision (class
 seventy-seven), read directly rather than through the review stage.

 LEDGER T8, EIGHTEENTH BATCH: no case gave the floor an archive block the
 slice grammar refuses, nor a revision it refuses. Writing them found the
 refusals saying "the block is paragraph", a list of shapes where a count
 belongs; they now count each side's blocks as the translate lanes' block
 floor does ("1 block (paragraph)").

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
