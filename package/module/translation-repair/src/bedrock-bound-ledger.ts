// AN ATTEMPT BEDROCK ACCEPTED IS SPEND WHETHER OR NOT ITS USAGE ARRIVED
// (ledger P1, 2026-09-28). The ledger is the only guard on the owner's card,
// and it noted completed calls with usage only: 873 Bedrock streams across the
// logs ended cut or overrun and none reached it, and a whole call whose stream
// carried no usage block would not have either (none of 190,009 logged calls
// did). Each such attempt is written at its bound, on the SPEND line and in
// the ledger, marked with why its figures are reckoned.

/**
 Writes one attempt at the most it could have been billed.

 @param servedId - model the attempt went to

 @param requestBodyBytes - size of the body the attempt sent

 @param maxTokens - `max_tokens` the body carried

 @param reckoning - why no reported usage prices it: abandoned before its
 end, or finished without a usage block

 @param ledger - the spend record the meter is read off

 @example
 ```ts
 await ledgerAtBound({ servedId, requestBodyBytes, maxTokens, reckoning: 'abandoned-bound', ledger, },);
