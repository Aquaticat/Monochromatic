/**
 * Tests that the structural floor still floors when the page refuses the strict
 * grammar.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE EXISTS TO STOP, measured on the sixth consolidation bed rather
 * than imagined. A slice boundary fell between an opening `details` tag and its
 * closing tag, so the page span carried no closing tag and the strict MDX
 * grammar refused it. The floor then had no block list to compare against, fell
 * back to the original alone, and a 164-character rendering passed against a
 * 3875-character page. Both lanes had carried that page whole; only the third
 * rendering dropped it, and it shipped.
 *
 * A CHECK THAT CANNOT RUN MUST NOT ANSWER YES. The page side now downgrades to
 * plain markdown, which reads the same span as a paragraph followed by an html
 * block, and the floor refuses the one-paragraph candidate on its own evidence.
 *
 * WHY THE FIXTURE IS UNBALANCED ON PURPOSE. A WELL-FORMED `details` element
 * parses under the strict grammar perfectly well, so a tidy fixture proves
 * nothing here: it would pass before the fix and after it. Only a span cut
 * through an element reproduces the refusal.
 * SINCE 2026-09-07 A SPAN CUT BETWEEN A CONTAINER'S TAGS READS STRICTLY: the
 * lone tag is masked before the parse and carried as a `container-tag` atom
 * (`mask-container-tags.ts`), because `container-extents.ts` cuts every
 * container whose blocks fall in different slices exactly that way, and the
 * Huasheng pass stopped on it. The relaxed path is therefore exercised here by
 * a page the grammar refuses for another reason, an inline tag torn from its
 * closer on the same line, and the cut-container page has its own cases.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention.
