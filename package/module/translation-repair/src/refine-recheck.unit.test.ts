/**
 Tests the refinement recheck, the checker round a refined slice passes
 before its rewrite may ship (ledger L11), by the verdict it returns for each
 kind of round: none to buy, one short of the checker stage's quorum, one
 that passes, and one that rolls the slice back.

 A ROUND SHORT OF ITS QUORUM IS THE CASE THIS FILE EXISTS FOR. With no ballot
 cast, no tally says worse, so such a round returned the findings of a round
 every checker answered and the rewrite shipped as rechecked. The same holds
 for one issue a round that met its quorum cast too few ballots on, so cases
 rule on two issues and hear a different number of ballots on each, on the
 three-seat bench and on a five-seat bench the router left short.

 Each case asserts the whole verdict: whether the rewrite is retained, every
 finding, and every issue's reading. The cases for what the slice settler
 then does with a verdict are in `refine-slice-settle.unit.test.ts`.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.

 never hears it and the client hands the refusal back as a schema mismatch,

 the stage reads as a seat no provider serves.
