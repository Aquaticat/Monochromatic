//region Translate lane wordings
// The translate lane's per-slice records turned into the shared per-slice
// wording shape, with each slice's outcome named rather than inferred.
//
// Split out of `translate-document.ts` at its line cap, and this is the seam
// worth splitting on: everything here is a TRANSLATION of one vocabulary into
// another, reading only settled records and the passages the lane could not
// fill, while what stays behind buys slices and assembles a document.
//
// The translation is not mechanical, which is why it is worth a file of its
// own. A settled record whose stage heard NO TRANSLATOR carries the incumbent
// as its text, because that is what the document keeps; passing it through as a
// decision said the stage examined the slice and chose the archive's wording,
// which is what a lost voice looks like when nothing separates the two.

/**
 * Builds the translate lane's per-slice wordings from its settled records.
 *
 * @param slices - preparation the lane ran over, which every wording is stamped
 * against rather than taken from the records, since a resumed run may hold
 * cache values written under an earlier preparation of the same entry
 *
 * @param settled - records the lane settled, unheard ones included
 *
 * @param unfilledChunkIndices - passages the lane reached and could not fill,
 * which have no wording because there is none to have, neither the archive's
 * nor one this run produced
 *
 * @returns One wording per prepared slice, in document order
 *
 * @throws {@link LaneSliceCoverageError} when the records do not cover the
 * preparation, since this lane visits every slice by contract and a gap it did
 * not name is a defect
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const wordings = translateLaneWordings({ slices, settled, unfilledChunkIndices, },);
