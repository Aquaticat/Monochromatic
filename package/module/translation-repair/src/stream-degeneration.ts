//region Stream degeneration
// WHETHER A MODEL HAS STOPPED SAYING ANYTHING NEW, which is a different failure
// from the one `stream-idle-guard.ts` watches for and is invisible to it.
//
// The idle guard asks whether bytes are arriving. A degenerating model answers
// yes forever: it emits continuously, at full speed, repeating itself. Measured
// over 1677 completed streams in the 2026-08-17 pass, the largest streams ran
// with gaps of 202 to 858 ms and only 61 streams paused longer than 5 s, so no
// silence window can separate a degenerating stream from a working one. Both
// idle constants are set to 600000 precisely because silence does not
// discriminate here.
//
// THE PROVIDER DOES NOT STOP THESE CALLS, and no production stage sends a token
// cap, so nothing upstream ends them either. The only remaining place to end
// them is here.
//
// WHAT IS MEASURED is the share of recent windows of text that are distinct. A
// model producing prose emits almost entirely fresh windows; one cycling on a
// phrase emits the same few windows forever. The measure is taken over a
// TRAILING sample rather than the whole stream, so a reply that degenerates
// after a healthy opening is still caught rather than diluted by its own good
// beginning.
//
// THIS MODULE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT THE WIRE FORMAT. It is fed generated text.
// Feeding it raw server-sent events would report every healthy stream as
// degenerate, because the JSON envelope around each token is identical by
// construction and would dominate the sample.

 * chance, and narrow enough that a short repeated phrase still fills several.

 * Equal to it here, so a verdict is offered exactly when the sample is full.
 *
 * SET SO THAT LENGTH ALONE NEVER CONDEMNS, and so that being verbose is not
 * treated as being broken. Some models legitimately write a great deal. The
 * ratio is what decides; this constant only decides when there is enough text
 * for the ratio to mean anything, and it is deliberately far above any real
 * reply. Across all 56 settled artifacts the longest recorded model output is
 * 8358 characters, so a bar at about 131000 sits roughly fifteen times above
 * anything this pipeline has ever legitimately produced.
 *
 * IT IS ALSO WHAT KEEPS VERSE SAFE. A translated poem carrying a refrain is
 * genuinely repetitive, and measured at 116800 characters one scored 0.036,
 * which the ratio alone would condemn. No slice translation approaches this
 * bar, so such a reply is never judged at all.
 *
 * REVISIT ONCE `#118` LANDS. The figure above is in characters of generated
 * text, while the only length telemetry in production counts raw server-sent
 * event bytes, envelope included. The two are related by a per-token envelope
 * cost that has been estimated and never measured, so this bar is set from the
 * artifact evidence rather than from that column.
