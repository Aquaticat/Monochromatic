//region Section pairing wire
// WHICH SECTION OF THE ORIGINAL DOES EACH SECTION OF THE TRANSLATION RENDER,
// asked of a model because the deterministic aligner has no signal to answer it
// with.
//
// MEASURED, not assumed. `headingAffinity` is token overlap, and Chinese
// headings share no tokens with English ones. Over the two corpus entries the
// forced aligner actually runs on: all 72 of `XIEPT2`'s affinity cells read
// 0.00, and 192 of `XingZ60`'s 195 read 0.00. The three that do not read 1.00,
// and they are exactly the English headings carrying a romanised name that also
// appears in the Chinese heading. With an all-zero grid every pairing scores
// alike, so every pairing is optimal, so the aligner refuses everything and
// `XIEPT2` reaches no slice at all. Reading two languages and saying which
// section renders which is comprehension, which is what
// `doc/decision/llm-assisted-block-pairing.md` already decided for blocks.
//
// SECTIONS GO WHOLE. The smallest context window in `synthetic-catalog.ts` is
// 131072 tokens and the largest sheet this corpus produces is 49921 characters,
// so a length cap would buy nothing and could only withhold the body text the
// question is about. Only two of 92 entries are ever asked, once each, cached.
//
// STRICTLY ONE-TO-ONE, unlike the block pairing. A `ChunkPair` carries one
// section on each side, so a merge or a split has nowhere to live downstream,
// and a reply describing one is refused rather than flattened into a pairing
// that would put mismatched sections in front of every later stage.
