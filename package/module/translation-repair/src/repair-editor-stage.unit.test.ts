/**
 * Tests for the editor stage's guards, its early exits, and the composite it
 * assembles once judging actually runs.
 *
 * `runEditorStage` had no test. Its judged path is covered PIECEWISE through
 * `selectPerEnvelope` and `selectChunkPatch`, which have their own suites, but
 * neither drives the WIRING between them: `applyCandidate` rebuilding
 * per-envelope winners into a composite, and that composite then competing at
 * chunk level, only happens inside `runEditorStage` itself. The rest of what
 * this file adds is the two places the stage decides NOT to go there.
 *
 * Both of those are cost properties as much as correctness ones. The provider is
 * flat-rate but not unlimited, and a run spends its capacity on judge calls it
 * did not need or on a fan-out against a roster that could never have been
 * judged. Neither shows up as an error; both show up as a pass that ran out of
 * budget with fewer entries settled.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention.
