/**
 Guards class one hundred twenty-four (shi_Yumiaoya24, 2026-09-25): the
 reader-protection rule opened "When a death was by suicide, the specific
 method is deliberately kept vague", so the judges read a survived attempt as
 outside it and chose "she swallowed a large amount of medication in the early
 hours of January 16 and attempted to end her life", one ballot writing
 "survived the attempt, so no method named", another calling the method "the
 appropriate way to handle the specific method mention in the original". The
 owner wrote on 2026-09-25 that dropping it is expected. The rule now covers a
 death and an attempt alike.

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
