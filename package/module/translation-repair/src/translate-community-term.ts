// CLASS ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN (shi_Yumiaoya19, 2026-09-24). The glossary put
// the community's words on every sheet as evidence to weigh, and for 药娘 the
// judges weighed the archive translator's comment higher and kept the word
// in Han, where two earlier runs had written two different English forms.
// The owner ruled on 2026-09-24 that the page says "trans girl" or "trans
// woman". A candidate that keeps a glossary term the original carries in
// Han, or writes a form the entry refuses (the pinyin), is refused HERE
// before any judge reads it. A rendering the entry lists is not required:
// a rendering inflects and the judges still choose among renderings. The
// owner added the same day that the term is refused even where the existing
// translation keeps it, so the page's own text earns no exception; comments
// are cut on both sides. Every match reads word boundaries
// (`glossary-match.ts`, class one hundred eighty-six).
