//region Container half pairs
// ONE CONTAINER, TWO SLICES. `container-extents.ts` gives a container's opening
// tag to the first block inside it and its closing tag to the last, so a
// disclosure block whose blocks fall in different slices puts `<details>` at
// the head of one slice and `</details>` at the foot of another. Each slice
// reads and validates on its own (class nine masks the lone tag), and nothing
// between the slicer and the page assembly knew which two slices were the two
// halves of one element. XingZ607 (2026-09-18) is what that costs: the
// admission left two opening halves unfilled on a split verdict about the
// summary alone, the closing halves shipped, the strict grammar refused the
// page at the first unmatched closing tag, and the guard, unable to blame one
// slice for two, withdrew all 88 of the lane's replacements.
//
// This reader names the pairs, from the SOURCE text of every slice in document
// order: the original is the one document whose containers are known to be
// whole, and a translation carries each lone tag as an atom the floor holds it
// to. The admission admits both halves together and each assembly withholds a
// half whose partner ships nothing.
