// This lives in its own module rather than beside the task that uses it. A task
// script is an ENTRY POINT, and exporting from one drags its top-level work
// into the package bundle: `score-probe.ts` called `main()` unguarded, so
// exporting this function from there made importing the LIBRARY scan a corpus
// directory and print to stdout. That call is guarded now, but a module the
// package exports should not be one that also runs something.

/**
 * Indexes readings by the issue that OWNS each one.
 *
 * Ownership comes from the record the reading was written on, never from the
 * issue lists inside its regions. A region names every issue it serves, and one
 * replacement can serve several accepted issues, so reading ownership off those
 * lists attaches whichever record happened to be indexed last. That is not a
 * rare collision: it is the ordinary case whenever an envelope served more than
 * one issue, and the joint counts would look perfectly normal while describing
 * the wrong record.
 *
 * @param owned - readings paired with their owning issue, across every artifact
 *
 * @returns Issue-keyed readings
 *
 * @throws {@link Error} when two records claim one issue id, which would mean
 * the identity this join rests on is not unique
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const byIssueId = indexReadingsByIssue({ owned, },);
 * ```
