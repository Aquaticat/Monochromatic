/**
 * Tests for the configuration check both lanes run before they start.
 *
 * FOUND BY FAULT INJECTION: configuring zero critic models ran the repair lane
 * end to end and returned a settled, unchanged document. No throw, no finding,
 * no marker, and zero model exchanges bought. Downstream that is
 * indistinguishable from a page that genuinely needed no repair, so a corpus
 * pass under the misconfiguration would spend hours writing a directory of
 * vacuous artifacts that later analysis reads as clean runs.
 *
 * The quiet path is RIGHT for outages, and stays. What this refuses is the
 * deterministic case, before any work is done.
 *
 * Fixtures are invented. No corpus content appears here.
