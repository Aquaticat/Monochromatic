//region Footnote parsed spans
// Where the parse of a fragment reads a GFM marker shape as no footnote
// reference (ledger B212): inside a URL, an inline code span, an image, a link
// reference definition, a masked comment, or the markup around a link's or a
// reference's label. The footnote
// graph answers the same question from the parse of a whole page, and a scan
// of raw fragments (`footnote-mentions.ts`) asks this module instead of
// restating the grammar. An earlier lexical reader of URLs disagreed with the
// parse in both directions: it dropped a reference the parse reads (a URL
// scheme with no domain after it, a literal inside a link's label) and
// counted a shape the parse reads as URL (a literal after a Han character, a
// digit or a full stop, a destination after whitespace).
//
// THE FRAGMENT IS PARSED AS MARKDOWN AND NOT AS A DOCUMENT. No front matter
// is split, which a fragment opening on a thematic break would misread.
// Invisible-only lines and HTML comments are masked as `parseDocument` masks
// them, since a comment hides the backtick that closes a code span and the
// end of a URL, and the page reads the masked text. Both masks are
// context-free scans from the left, so a region the fragment masks the page
// masks too, and a marker the fragment leaves unmasked may lie in a comment
// the page opened earlier, which only ever counts one mention too many.
// Slices are cut at the offsets of a page's top-level blocks, so a fragment
// starts where a block starts and its inline readings agree with the page's.
//
// BOTH GRAMMARS MUST AGREE. The page is read as strict MDX where that
// accepts it and as plain markdown where it does not, which a fragment cannot
// know. They differ in block structure (a fence indented four spaces is code
// to the first and a paragraph line to the second, and so decides whether a
// backtick pair closes a code span), so a region is skipped only where both
// read it, and a marker one grammar reads as text stays counted.
//
// ONLY REGIONS THE FRAGMENT'S OWN TEXT SETTLES ARE READ. A code block, a raw
// HTML node and a JSX attribute are left to the scan, which counts a marker
// there: a fragment that opens or closes a fence for the page cannot know
// whether the page reads the shape as code, and the guards cannot afford a
// dropped reference.

 The two differ in block structure (an indented fence is code to one and a
 line of a paragraph to the other), so a region is read only where BOTH
 grammars read it, which can only leave a marker counted. Where the strict
 grammar refuses the fragment, plain markdown alone decides.

 A DEFINITION IS ONE THE PAGE'S OWN GRAMMAR OPENS, read the way `parseDocument`
 chooses it: strict MDX where it accepts the fragment, plain markdown where it
 does not. A label four spaces in or more is a definition to the strict
 grammar, which has no indented code, and a code block or a line of the
 paragraph to plain markdown, and the footnote graph reads whichever grammar
 the page was parsed under. Skipping a region needs both grammars because a
 dropped reference is the costly error; no role is the safe side, so the role
 follows the grammar the page most likely has, which is the strict one for
