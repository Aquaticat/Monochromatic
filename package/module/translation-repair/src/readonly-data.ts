//region Readonly data views
// A recursively readonly VIEW of structural data this package borrows but does
// not own.
//
// `Readonly<T>` is shallow. `Readonly<{ children: Node[] }>` stops the property
// being reassigned and leaves the array and every element mutable, so a deep
// readonly checker still reports the nested writable path. That is why
// annotating a borrowed value with `Readonly` moves a finding rather than
// clearing it.
//
// These are VIEWS, not copies. A mutable external value is structurally
// assignable to a readonly projection of itself, so nothing is cloned at
// runtime and the external discriminated unions survive intact. That matters
// for mdast, whose consumers narrow on `node.type` across many variants.

/**
 * Recursively exposes structural data through readonly properties.
 *
 * Intended for records, unions, arrays and tuples: plain parsed or borrowed
 * data. Not for stateful class instances, whose methods and private state this
 * would misdescribe.
 *
 * Homomorphic on purpose. Mapping over `keyof Value` preserves arrays and
 * tuples as readonly arrays and readonly tuples rather than flattening them
 * into objects keyed by index.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * type Reading = DeepReadonlyData<{ entries: { id: string; }[]; }>;
 * ```
