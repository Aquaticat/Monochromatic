/**
 Tests for the guard that separates a rendering of nothing from nothing to
 render, and for the rule a settled record states beside it: a passage the
 archive never translated never settles on text that shows nothing.

 THE RULE HAS NO ROUTE THROUGH THE LANE, since every way of producing
 nothing throws before a record is built; its cases call it directly, as
 the census asked of the statement it replaced (ledger T8, sixth batch).

 WHAT THIS ADDS BESIDE THE JUDGE'S OWN CASE, which was measured rather than
 assumed: `translate-judge.unit.test.ts` hand-builds a slate whose sole
 candidate is whitespace and proves the judge throws, and removing this guard
 fails that case too. So the yes arm and the trim on the winner side are
 already driven, through the one caller there is.
 
 THE SECOND CONJUNCT IS WHAT NOTHING ELSE ASKS. That case's original always
 says something, because a slate is only judged where there was a passage to
 render, so nothing varies the source side. A slice whose original is empty
 must settle as the absence it is rather than as a passage this run emptied,
 and a guard reading the winner alone would call it a deletion.
 
 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
