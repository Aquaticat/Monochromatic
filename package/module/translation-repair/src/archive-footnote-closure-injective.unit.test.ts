/**
 Holds the footnote relabel closure to the one property its callers rely on:
 no two archive labels end on one label.

 LEDGER T8, EIGHTEENTH BATCH: `closeFootnoteRelabel` checked its own result
 for two archive labels merging and refused it, a branch no input reached,
 since the closure is injective by construction (its TSDoc states why). The
 check went, and this file reads the property instead, over every map a
 small universe allows: every nonempty set of archive labels, every nonempty
 set of original labels, and every set of relations between them, each
 closed result's destinations read for a repeat.

 It also counts the closed results that took the forced pair and those that
 displaced a label to a fresh one, so a change that stopped reaching either
 construction would fail here rather than leave the property read over the
 plain relations alone.
