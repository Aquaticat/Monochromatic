/**
 Whether the damage probe's report lets the rewrite it read ship, and why
 not when it does not.

 AN ADMITTED CLAIM ROLLS THE REWRITE BACK (ledger L11), whatever the number
 of probers heard: one prober's claim counts when the screen bears out its
 quote, so a claim a lone heard prober made is damage evidence on its own.

 A ROUND SHORT OF ITS QUORUM ROLLS IT BACK TOO, under
 `refine-probe-unheard`, as a recheck short of its checkers' quorum does:
 no claim from a round that heard too few probers is silence, not a clean
 bill, and the package's gates between a new text and a standing one ship
 the standing text unless enough voices stood behind the new one. The quorum
 is read through `silentStagesOf`, the reader the caches and the recheck
 use, off the probe stage's own `stage-quorum-unmet` finding.

 CLAIMS ARE READ FIRST because the settler attaches no report to a rollback:
 a short round named unheard would leave a claim the screen admitted in no
 finding and no outcome. Its short round still shows, since the probe
 stage's own findings ride beside either rollback.
