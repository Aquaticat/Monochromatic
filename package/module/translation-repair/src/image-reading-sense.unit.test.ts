/**
 Tests for deciding whether a model's reading of a picture may be used.

 WHAT THESE PIN is a rule whose two branches cost very different things.
 Trusting a bad reading licenses replacing a human's careful transcription with
 something derived from a misreading, and the judges cannot tell, because the
 reading is the only evidence they are given about the picture. Falling back
 costs nothing that exists today, since the block is then protected and left
 alone, which is where every transcript already stands. So the rule is
 deliberately eager to fall back, and these tests pin that direction rather
 than a balance.

 The rule itself is written out in
 `doc/planning/when-an-image-reading-makes-no-sense.md`.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
