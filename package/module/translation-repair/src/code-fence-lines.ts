//region Fenced code line flags
// Says, for each line of a body, whether that line belongs to a fenced code
// block. Exists so that masking passes can leave code alone.
//
// Inside a fence, a line holding a zero-width space is CONTENT. Blanking it
// rewrites the document being repaired, which is the one thing a
// length-preserving mask exists to avoid.
//
// Ambiguity resolves toward reporting a line as fenced wherever there is a
// choice. A line wrongly reported fenced merely goes unmasked, which is the
// behaviour that shipped before masking existed; a line wrongly reported
// unfenced can have its content silently rewritten. The two errors are not
// comparable.
//
// That is a preference, not a guarantee, and one gap is known. CommonMark
// measures fence indentation from the enclosing CONTAINER, while this reads it
// from the line start, so a fence inside a list item whose content column is
// four or more reads as unfenced here. An invisible-only line inside that block
// would then be masked, which is the corrupting direction. Container tracking
// is what closes it, and the pinned corpus contains no fenced code blocks at
// all, so nothing is bought by building it yet.
