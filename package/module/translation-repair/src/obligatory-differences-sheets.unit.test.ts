/**
 Tests that the critic and the panel judge obligatory differences between
 the languages by one rule (ledger L5).

 WHY. The critic carried a whole block on obligatory differences (a supplied
 subject or object, punctuation conventions, distinctions English cannot
 mark, connections made explicit) while the panel carried one line on
 conjunctions, connectives, pronouns and small words, so the panel upheld an
 addition claim against a possessor English had to state (TianqiChen66616
 slice 20). Rendered sheets showed the panel carried none of the critic's
 block.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention mirroring corpus structure only.
