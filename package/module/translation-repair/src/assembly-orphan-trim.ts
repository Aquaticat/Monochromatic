//region Orphan definition trim
// AN ORPHAN DEFINITION TAKES ONLY ITS OWN BLOCK. The nineteenth `hakureico`
// pass of 2026-09-09 rendered the source's two footnote definitions as one
// insertion behind the sealed letter; the seal keeps the archive's letter,
// which never carried the second marker, so the second definition was an
// orphan, and the assembly guard withdrew the whole insertion, the first
// definition with it, leaving the body's `[^1]` with no note. A replacement
// that is nothing but definition blocks can lose the orphan's block alone and
// keep the rest, which is what the page needed. The twenty-first class.
//
// A DEFINITION LINE OPENS A BLOCK, blank line or not. The twenty-first pass
// rendered the two notes as `[^1]: …\n[^2]: …`, one paragraph by the blank-line
// reading, and the trim saw one block labelled `1` and left it; the guard then
// withdrew both notes and the reference. GFM ends a definition where the next
// `[^id]:` line begins, so the reading here does too, and the gaps between
// blocks are kept as written so a cut changes nothing beside the cut.
//
// ONLY DEFINITIONS-ONLY REPLACEMENTS ARE TRIMMED. Prose that carries a
// definition among its paragraphs is a judged rendering, and cutting a block
// out of it would ship a text nobody judged; that replacement is withdrawn
// whole, as before.
