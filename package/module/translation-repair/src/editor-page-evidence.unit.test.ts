/**
 Guards the evidence half of ledger S14: the editors and both editor
 selections read the declared names and the cited references the critic and
 the panel read, and the editors see the community renderings their selection
 judges are shown.

 The critic filed and the panel accepted issues with the declared names and
 the references on their sheets; the editors repairing those issues and the
 judges choosing among the repairs had neither, so an editor could "correct" a
 declared name or strip a detail a cited page states, and a judge could prefer
 it. The selection judges were shown the community renderings a candidate
 lacks; the editors writing the candidates never were.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention.
