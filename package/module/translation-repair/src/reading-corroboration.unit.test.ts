/**
 * Tests for whether two models' readings of the same picture corroborate
 * each other, purely from how much of their character trigrams overlap.
 *
 * WHAT THESE PIN is the three design decisions the module's own header
 * explains and measures: trigrams rather than shared anchors or single
 * characters, dividing by the smaller reading so one model transcribing more
 * of a picture than another is not scored as disagreement, and cutting by
 * code point so a reading carrying an emoji or another character outside the
 * basic plane still cuts the same way for every reader. The boundary case
 * pins the comparison's direction directly, since `overlap < threshold` and
 * `overlap <= threshold` differ only at the one value a range assertion over
 * ordinary fixtures could never land on by chance.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
