/**
 Tests reading a roster model's decisions side (ledger T8): a decision seat
 hands back the side its card carries, and a chat seat, whose card carries
 none, is refused by name rather than read as undefined. The seats are drawn
 from the roster itself, so the case follows the roster as it changes. Also
 tests building a record over exactly the keys it is given.
