// Stands in for the system clock in the cases that set it, the way a person
// or a time daemon does (ledger B78): `Date.now` answers a reading the case
// moves. The stub goes through the case's own sandbox, `ctx.sinon`, which
// module-test answers only to code running in that case's async context
// (`sandbox-slot.ts`), so the cases a suite runs beside it, sixteen at a time
// by default, and the logger's stamps read the real clock; the runner puts
// the clock back when the case ends. The first form of this fixture replaced
// `Date.now` for the whole process, and a pacer in a sibling case read the
// stepped clock and slept on it (ledger M100). This file and its own test are
// the two that `wall-clock-reads.unit.test.ts` lets name the wall clock, since
// replacing it is the point.
