/**

 * artifact root and version 2 writes them inside the repair lane, and every
 * reader kept asking the root. Nothing caught it: raw JSON has no type to
 * disagree with, so the retired key answered `undefined` and the reader that
 * tolerated absence reported an empty corpus.
 *
 * So the first case puts DECOY records at the retired key. A reader that still
 * asks the root passes every other case here and fails that one.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
