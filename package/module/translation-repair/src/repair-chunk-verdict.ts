//region Repair chunk verdict
// What one slice ends up saying about itself: which candidate won, and whether
// the text it returns differs from the archive's.
//
// THOSE ARE TWO QUESTIONS, and a slice answers both. Selection decides whether
// a repair proved itself; the text decides what the document carries. They come
// apart when a patch whose envelope operations cancel wins selection and writes
// no byte, and every count downstream reads one or the other, so a slice that
// conflates them is wrong in one of the two places.
//
// A THIRD ANSWER SITS BESIDE THEM: whether a declared name was refused here. The
// editor's judges lose one six times out of six when asked, measured against
// their own sheet and roster, so the loss is refused rather than argued about,
// and `declared-name-survival.ts` records why that is a guard and not a prompt.
//
// REFUSED HERE RATHER THAN OVERRIDDEN AFTERWARDS, because a caller that reset
// the text after this returned would produce `patchSelected` true with `changed`
// false, which this file already uses for something else entirely: a patch that
// won on the measurements and whose envelope operations cancelled. The two would
// then be one shape meaning two things. Selection still reports what it found,
// since the patch did beat the archive on the measurements and hiding that would
// make the refusal unauditable; what changes is only what ships.
