//region Quote normalization
// Models copy quote evidence with ASCII punctuation while the corpus uses
// curly variants (the en editing guide mandates them), so byte-exact
// location rejects real evidence: on Xu_Yushu, most unresolved issues
// failed exactly this way ("father's" vs "father’s"). Normalization maps
// punctuation variants onto one canonical character, strictly one-to-one in
// UTF-16 units, so an offset found in normalized text indexes the original
// text unchanged and anchors keep the document's canonical bytes.
//
// TWO FOLDS, FOR TWO QUESTIONS (ledger B24). The EVIDENCE fold
// (`normalizePunctuation`) asks whether a model's quote is the document's
// words: it also folds the corner brackets, because a model quoting a Chinese
// passage paraphrases them. The TYPOGRAPHY fold (`straightenQuotes`) asks
// whether two renderings are the same wording up to what the typography
// restoration (`restore-typography.ts`) would make of them: curly and straight
// only, since a rendering that kept 「」 and one that wrote English quotes are
// different renderings, one of them wrong. A comparison of a quote against its
// source takes the first; a comparison of two renderings takes the second.
//
// MAPS, NOT PLAIN OBJECTS (ledger B77). Every key here is one UTF-16 unit, and
// no name an object inherits is one unit long, so no lookup could reach one;
// the tables are maps all the same, so every table the package keys by text
// has one shape and `text-keyed-tables.unit.test.ts` needs no exceptions.

/**
 Punctuation variants mapped onto canonical ASCII, one UTF-16 unit each.
 CJK corner brackets join the quote classes:
 models paraphrase 「」 as curly or ASCII quotes when quoting zh sources
 (live: a model closing 「...。」 as ...。”), and every bracket here is a
 single UTF-16 unit, so the length guarantee holds.

/**
 Collapses only SOLE line breaks onto plain spaces, leaving a run of them as
 it stands.

 WHY A RUN IS LEFT ALONE: a lone break inside a paragraph is a soft wrap, and
 a model quoting across it writes a space, so the two forms mean the same text.
 A run of breaks is a STRUCTURAL boundary. Collapsing those too made a blank
 line into two spaces, so a quote carrying two spaces matched straight across
 a paragraph boundary the document keeps: safe only for as long as every model
 joined lines with exactly one space, which is not a property this pipeline can
 assume of its inputs. A run now matches nothing but itself.

 WHAT IT STILL DOES NOT PROTECT: boundaries a single line break represents,
 inside fenced code, between list items, and between table rows, plus a
 Markdown hard break, whose two trailing spaces plus a wrap read as three
 spaces. Those need the parse rather than the characters, and stay unprotected
 here.

 Length-preserving like everything here, so offsets still index the input.
