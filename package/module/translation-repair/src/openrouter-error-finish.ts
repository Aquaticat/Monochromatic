//region OpenRouter error finish
// A GENERATION THE PROVIDER MARKED FAILED, delivered as a whole stream. The
// gateway normalizes every upstream's stop reason to one of `stop`, `length`,
// `tool_calls`, `content_filter` and `error` (its API reference, read
// 2026-09-08), and the mid-stream failure it documents writes a top-level
// `error` object beside `finish_reason: "error"` and closes without `[DONE]`,
// which `openrouter-stream-error.ts` reads. The wire also carries a second
// shape that reference does not draw: a stream that reasons for tens of
// seconds, writes no content, closes its choice with `finish_reason: "error"`
// and no error object, and then sends `[DONE]`. Seven such replies since
// 2026-09-03 (GLM-5.3-Flash four times on Together; gpt-oss-120b on Together;
// deepseek-v4-pro-0813 on CoreWeave after 8284 reasoning characters and 24 s
// in the eleventh hakureico pass, 2026-09-08 18:08 UTC), each billed at cost
// 0 and each read by the reply ladder as the model's unparseable answer:
// `schema-mismatch (content is not valid JSON: Unexpected end of JSON input
// (model stopped with finish_reason=error)) raw="", voice lost`. THE
// EIGHTEENTH CLASS: the provider said the call failed and the pipeline
// counted the failure as the model's vote.
//
// READ AS A PROVIDER FAILURE, so the call rides the retry ladder under its
// own name, the way the documented shape already does.
