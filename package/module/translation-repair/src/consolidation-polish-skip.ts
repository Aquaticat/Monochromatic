//region Unpolished baseline
// ONE ANSWER FOR EVERY BASE NO POLISH MAY RUN OVER, shared by
// `polishConsolidation` and by a settlement that kept the archive because no
// wording passed the deterministic rule (owner, 2026-09-27, "Keep archive,
// ship"). `assertFinalNaturalnessComplete` accepts a front-matter slice only
// under the front-matter reason and a body slice only under the unsafe-baseline
// one, so the two callers must never drift apart on which is which.
//
// NOT REACHED THROUGH `applyFinalPolish` by the archive-kept settlement,
// deliberately: that function first checks the settlement's text for dropped
// contributor names and stops the entry on a drop, and an archive-kept
// settlement's text is the refused standing, which never ships.
