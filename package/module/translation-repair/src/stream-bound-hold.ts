//region Stream bound hold
// CLASS ONE HUNDRED FORTY-EIGHT. A call cut at its card's stream bound says
// one provider has stopped serving one model at its measured pace; Bedrock
// kept `google.gemma-4-26b-a4b` at its usual 1 s while `google.gemma-4-e2b`
// ran 219 to 263 s. So the hold is the pair's: the provider keeps its other
// models, and the model keeps its other providers. A model no other provider
// serves reads unreachable while the hold runs, so a round counts the seat
// out of its quorum instead of waiting on it (class twenty-six).
