/**
 * Tests for removing a truncated provider channel marker ahead of JSON.
 *
 * The case that matters is the one the previous implementation could not
 * handle. It matched the exact string `|>`, which is what survived on
 * 2026-08-12; on 2026-08-13 the surviving tail grew to `p|>` and `ep|>` and the
 * exact match stopped firing, losing 21 of the 23 voices lost in that run
 * window. The rule under test is therefore the SHAPE of a `<|word|>` tail
 * rather than a vocabulary of known markers.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention.
