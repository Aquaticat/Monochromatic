/**
 Tests the clamp that brings an edit's over-deep quotation lines back to the
 depth the region already had. Its behaviour inside an application is pinned in
 `apply-patch.unit.test.ts`; these cases read the clamp itself, on lines that
 carry markers and no words. Fixtures are cat-themed invention.
