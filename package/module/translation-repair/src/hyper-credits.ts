// ONE NUMBER, unlike the other provider's two-limit reading. There is no
// rolling window and no percentage here: the balance is spent down and refills
// whole, measured at every 24 hours, so the only budget question this provider
// can answer is how much is left right now.
//
// THE REFILL INSTANT IS NOT MODELLED. The refresh was observed at 02:53 and the
// zone it was observed in was never established, so computing a wall-clock
// "back at" from it would state a fact nobody measured. A caller that needs to
// report when the budget returns should read the balance again rather than
// predict it.
//
// A malformed body is a provider protocol failure and throws, matching
// `synthetic-quota.ts`: model-content defects flow as data, protocol defects do
// not. Quota reads cost nothing, so a driver may poll.
