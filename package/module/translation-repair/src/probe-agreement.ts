//region Probe agreement
// Comparing what the introduced-defect probe said about a repair with what the
// human said about the same repair, which is the only thing that can decide
// whether the probe should ever be allowed to block one.
//
// The comparison is made at ISSUE level rather than region level, because that
// is the level the two instruments share. A region can serve several accepted
// issues, and the human grades issues; asking "what did the human say about
// this region" has no answer when a merged envelope's issues were graded
// differently.
//
// ONE CELL OF THIS TABLE IS CLEAN AND THE REST ARE NOT, and saying so is the
// point. A repair grade of Y means "fully fixes this defect AND breaks nothing
// nearby", so Y beside a probe finding is a direct human refutation: the human
// looked at the same wording and said nothing nearby broke. N is ambiguous by
// construction, since it fires both for a repair that did not fix its target
// and for one that damaged something, and nothing in the sheet separates those.
// So `refutedByHuman` is evidence and `sharedWithHuman` is only suggestive.
