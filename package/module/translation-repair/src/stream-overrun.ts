//region Stream overrun
// THE SECOND WAY A CALL RUNS AWAY, and the one repetition cannot see. A model
// that writes ten times more answer than any legitimate call ever wrote is not
// repeating itself: every window is distinct, so both detectors in
// `stream-runaway-watch.ts` report a healthy stream while it runs to the wall
// clock.
//
// The bound is a volume, measured rather than chosen:
// `doc/decision/translation-repair-runaway-call-termination.md` records the
// largest legitimate content emission anywhere at 4,278 characters, against
// the two content-producing cuts at 25,482 and 28,026.
//
// WHY A SHARED PREDICATE LIVES HERE. `#120` was one defect repeated at several
// classification sites: the retry ladder re-bought a runaway because its check
// named one error class and a second had been added beside it. Every site that
// asks "did we end this call ourselves" now asks it through
// `isSelfEndedStream`, so a third guard added later updates one place instead
// of three.
