/**
 * Tests that the sheets which MEASURE are told what this corpus is written
 * under, and told how the rules land on their own verdicts.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The rendering auditor, the resolution checker and the
 * introduced-defect prober all grade text against the ORIGINAL, and none had
 * ever been shown the house rules. Nothing ships from any of the three, which
 * is why they were fixed after the deciding sheets rather than with them; what
 * they do decide is which defects get worked on next. An auditor that has not
 * been told reader protection exists scores a deliberately vague passage as an
 * omission, and that grade is then quoted as a measurement of the pipeline.
 *
 * THE VERDICT MAPPING IS ASSERTED SEPARATELY from the shared block. The three
 * verdict vocabularies are disjoint, so the block deliberately names none of
 * them and each sheet supplies its own line. A splice alone would leave a
 * checker knowing the rule and not knowing what to answer.
 *
 * ONE SENTENCE PER SHEET stands for the block, so rewording the house rules
 * does not break three tests at once. The sentence chosen is the one that
 * decides the protected case.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention.
