//region Consolidate produce
// THE PRODUCING HALF of the consolidation, kept apart from the deciding half
// for the reason `#109` split the translate lane: a slate that exists can be
// judged more than once, and every measurement of this stage rests on comparing
// arms over ONE slate. A stage that rebought its proposals per arm would be
// comparing different candidates and reporting the difference as a decision.
//
// THE PAGE IS THE STRUCTURAL STANDARD, NOT THE ORIGINAL. `validateTranslatedSlice`
// is given `pageText`, the archive's own rendering, so a candidate has to carry
// the block sequence the page carries. Measured on the first calibration slice,
// where the Chinese is one paragraph and the archive renders it as a block quote
// with an attribution line: anchored to the source alone, all six consolidations
// were called invalid and the winner had flattened both into one paragraph.
//
// THE PAGE IS THE ARCHIVE, NOT THE LANE THAT WON. The winning lane is the
// INCUMBENT, which is a different job: a candidate that reproduces it is left
// alone rather than re-asked.
