/**
 Matches a replacement's line-ending edges to the span it replaces.
 
 A content span in the archive ends where its block ends, and the block
 separator after it belongs to the document, not to the span. A lane that
 returns its text with a trailing line ending (a writer closing its answer
 with a newline, which the deterministic floor has no reason to refuse) would
 have that ending written verbatim ahead of the separator, and the page would
 carry one more blank line than the archive did at that boundary. Class
 seventy-five (CuspariaKLSY2, 2026-09-21): a list-intro slice shipped
 "…transitioning:\n" and the page carried a double blank line between the
 intro and its list where the archive and the original both carry one.
 
 The rule: the written text carries exactly the leading and trailing
 line-ending runs the replaced span carried, whatever its lane wrapped it in.
 Inside the text nothing is touched, so hard breaks, verse lines and fenced
 blocks stay as the lane wrote them.
