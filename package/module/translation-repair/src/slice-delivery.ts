//region Slice delivery
// What became of every slice, in one row: the original, the archive's English,
// what the lane decided, what the document ends up carrying, and WHY those last
// two are what they are.
//
// The lane results already carry the pieces, and a reader cannot join them. A
// wording says what a lane decided and says nothing about whether the document
// kept it; an index set says which slices the document carries a change for and
// nothing about the wording; the source text is in neither, so a grader holding
// an artifact cannot see what was being translated without re-preparing the
// corpus at the right commit with the right budget.
//
// DELIVERY IS ITS OWN VOCABULARY, deliberately not reusing either lane's. A
// repair disposition is the fate of ONE ISSUE's targeted edit, and a translate
// disposition is a slice-local acceptance decision; both can hold several
// values inside one slice whose text ships once. This names the fate of the
// slice TEXT and nothing else.
//
// TWO AXES, since 2026-08-16, because one word could not carry both. What the
// LANE did is its outcome and what the DOCUMENT carries is its delivery, and a
// row states each separately: a run blocked before an anchor never evaluated
// that slice and also leaves a gap there, and the single vocabulary this
// replaced had to report one of those facts and drop the other.
