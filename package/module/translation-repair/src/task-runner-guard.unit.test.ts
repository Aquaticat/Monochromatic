/**
 Tests the verdict on whether a built command may run in a process, given that
 process's environment and the command's name.

 The environment is handed in as an argument, so every case builds its own with
 invented variables and none reads the environment of the process running the
 suite, which holds real keys in some worktrees and none in others. The as-built
 cases are in `corpus-run/task-runner-guard-built.unit.test.ts`.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
