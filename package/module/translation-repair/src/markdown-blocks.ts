// TOP-LEVEL BLOCKS OF A PASSAGE, for the target-only run, which splices the
// archive's own text and so needs each block's exact bytes, kind and place.
//
// READ OFF THE PARSE (ledger B68), not split on blank lines. A split is not
// what the parser reads: a blockquote may open on the line after a
// paragraph's with no blank line between, and a fence carrying a blank line
// between its own lines is one block to the parser and two to a split. The
// quote guard met the same shape first and counts off the parse the floor
// reads (ledger B42, `quote-preservation.ts`).
//
// NO CARRIAGE-RETURN FOLD IS NEEDED. A split looking for `\n\n` found no
// boundary in a CRLF file (`people/gqt/page.md` is the one such file in the
// pinned corpus) and read the whole page as one block. The slice grammar reads
// CRLF line endings, and its offsets index the text as written, `\r` included.

 One top-level block as the parse reads it: its exact source bytes, its node
 kind, and the offsets those bytes occupy in the text it was read from.

 A CONTAINER TAG STANDING ALONE IS A BLOCK HERE. The slice grammar masks a
 lone `<details>` or `</details>` so the rest of the passage parses, and a
 passage cut inside a container ends on one; the target-only run anchors on
 the source's last block, so leaving the tag out would anchor one block too
 early and carry the tag into the protected run as well as the lane's own
 rendering.
