//region Repair not applicable
// What the repair lane has to say about a passage the archive never translated:
// nothing, said explicitly.
//
// The lane MENDS EXISTING WORDING. Its critics compare a translation against
// its original and file defects in what is there; its editor rewrites regions
// those defects name; its checkers confirm the defects are gone. Handed an
// anchor, which names a boundary where a rendering belongs and none exists,
// every one of those stages is asked about text that does not exist. What comes
// back is not a repair: it is a critic inventing complaints about a blank, at
// full roster cost, on every slice `#100` inserts.
//
// SAID RATHER THAN SKIPPED. The outcome list is read BY POSITION against the
// slice list, so an anchor cannot simply be passed over; and a lane that
// silently produced nothing for a slice would be indistinguishable from one
// that examined it and found it clean. This states the third thing: the
// question does not apply here, and the translate lane owns this passage.
//
// NOT CACHED, because it costs nothing to state and depends on nothing a run
// can change. A cache entry would only add a way for it to go stale.
