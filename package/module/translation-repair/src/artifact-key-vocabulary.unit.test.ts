/**
 * Tests for which spelling of the renamed keys each artifact generation used.
 *
 * THE POSITIVE CONTROL COMES FIRST here, because every other case in this file
 * is a lookup and a lookup table that returned the same row for everything
 * would satisfy all of them. The first case pins that the two named tables
 * actually disagree, on every field, so the dispatch has something to decide.
 *
 * GENERATION 3 IS THE INTERESTING ONE, and it is why a table exists at all
 * rather than a boolean. It spells the change-set keys the new way and the
 * slice index the old way, because the array rename forced a wire change on
 * artifacts whose lane result is passed through whole while the index rename
 * did not. A reader holding one flag would read every generation 3 artifact's
 * slice index as ABSENT.
 *
 * Fixtures are version numbers and key names. There is no passage here.
