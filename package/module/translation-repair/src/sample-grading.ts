//region Sample grading model
// The milestone-three headline gate is precision of accepted issues on a
// human-graded sample, because a judge ensemble drawn from the same seven
// models re-affirming its own panel's acceptances is circular. The draw is
// stratified by page-size band: the accumulation pool skews small, so a plain
// uniform draw would under-represent the heavily-sliced large tail, exactly
// where the lockstep slicing fix most affects precision. This module owns the
// corpus-free model -- size-band cuts, the grading candidate, and flattening
// one accepted issue into a candidate. The seeded draw lives in
// `sample-draw.ts` and the sheet rendering in `grading-sheet.ts`; the
// corpus-reading wiring lives in the corpus-run script, since sheet content
// quotes UNLICENSED corpus text and must never be committed.
