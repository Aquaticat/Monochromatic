/**
 * Tests that assembly GIVES EACH SLICE ITS OWN REPAIR when it lists what the
 * document carries.
 *
 * WHAT THAT LIST IS FOR. `#107`'s own example is two NEIGHBOURING slices
 * shipping the same wording, which the document-scale repetition check cannot
 * see because the duplicated sentence carries no long word. The adjacent check
 * exists for exactly that, and it reads a per-slice list assembly builds by
 * matching each surviving replacement to the slice it was written for.
 *
 * WHAT WAS MEASURED. On 2026-08-25, inverting that match, so each slice takes
 * the first replacement written for a DIFFERENT slice, failed no test in this
 * package. The assembled document is unaffected, every count still agrees, and
 * only the adjacency check is handed a shuffled list; it then reports
 * repetitions between slices that share nothing and misses the ones that do.
 *
 * THREE SLICES, WHICH IS THE FEWEST THAT CAN SHOW IT. Swapping two adjacent
 * slices' wordings leaves the pair unchanged, so a two-slice fixture cannot
 * tell a correct match from an inverted one. With three, an inverted match
 * lands the same wording on two neighbours and manufactures a repetition.
 *
 * THE SECOND CASE IS THE KILL and the first is its liveness control: without
 * one showing the check speaks, "no finding" would be satisfied by a check
 * that never says anything.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
