/**
 Guards ledger S8: the cited-reference rules, the narrative bound and reader
 protection say which of them governs where they meet.

 A characterization or an event a cited reference states was ACCURATE on the
 reference rules and an addition on the narrative bound ("an event, an
 action ... or a characterization the ORIGINAL does not state is an addition"),
 and both sat on the same critic, panel and contest sheets. Neither rule
 limited reader protection, so a method a cited page stated plainly read as
 accurate detail to keep. The dispute note told a judge to weigh an accepted
 addition "against the ORIGINAL alone" beside a reference rule saying the
 opposite, with nothing to say the panel had already weighed the references.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention.
