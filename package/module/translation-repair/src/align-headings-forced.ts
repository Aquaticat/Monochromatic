//region Forced heading alignment
// An aligner that can REFUSE. The shipped scorer cannot: a pairing scores
// `diagonal + headingAffinity`, which is never below zero, while a gap costs
// `GAP_PENALTY` per side, so pairing two headings that share nothing scores 0
// against -0.70 for leaving both unpaired and the maximum always prefers the
// unsupported pairing. Every gap it emits is the forced surplus of a length
// difference, never a judgement that two headings do not correspond.
//
// This one scores LEXICOGRAPHICALLY: trusted anchors first, then fewest gaps,
// then soft affinity. And it emits a pairing only when that pairing lies on
// EVERY optimal path, which is what makes "I cannot tell" expressible. Anything
// else comes back ambiguous, and an ambiguous section gets no critic work, per
// `doc/decision/translation-repair-unpairable-section.md`.
//
// Measured against production over 92 entries: 90 align identically, XingZ60
// keeps 12 of its 13 pairs and loses only the wrong one, and XIEPT2 refuses all
// 8 rather than pairing Chinese prose against bare English headings.

/**
 * Why a heading ended up with no partner.
 *
 * `forced-gap` means no optimal path pairs it at all, so the other side simply
 * has nothing for it. `ambiguous` means several optimal pairings exist and the
 * aligner declines to guess, which is the outcome the shipped scorer cannot
 * produce.
 *
 * `roster-unpaired` comes from somewhere else entirely: a model was shown both
 * documents and did not name this section in its pairing. It is kept separate
 * from the other two because those describe a scorer's table and this describes
 * a reading, and on this corpus the two disagree about nearly every section.
