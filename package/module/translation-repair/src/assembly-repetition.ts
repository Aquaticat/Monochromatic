// DAMAGE THAT IS ONLY VISIBLE IN THE WHOLE DOCUMENT, which every per-slice
// instrument in this package is structurally blind to.
//
// `#66` measured the introduced-defect probe against two defects known to have
// shipped and it named neither. One was an ordinary miss. The other,
// `lintong`'s duplicated farewell, could not have been caught by that probe at
// any setting: it compares one edited region against itself before the edit,
// and the duplication is inside no single region. Slice 3 kept wording it was
// not asked to remove, slice 2 wrote a fresh rendering of the same thing, and
// each edit is defensible alone. Only the assembled document shows it.
//
// NO MODEL, NO ROSTER, NO QUOTA. The comparison that makes this decidable is
// the ARCHIVE, which `#96` decided to store in the artifact and `#128` wired in.
// A phrase the archive says once and the shipped document says twice is a
// repetition this pipeline introduced. That is a fact about two strings.
//
// WHY THE ARCHIVE IS THE BASELINE RATHER THAN A RULE ABOUT PROSE. Real writing
// repeats: refrains, names, deliberate echoes. A standalone "says it twice"
// check would fire on all of them. Counting against the archive asks the only
// question worth asking, which is whether the pipeline ADDED a repetition, and
// it inherits the author's own judgement about acceptable repetition for free.

 * finished text carries THREE content words in 33 characters, while two of the
 * others carry ZERO and ONE. Six words with no word longer than four letters is
 * an ordinary English collocation that any two paragraphs may share, not a
 * passage a document said twice.
 *
 * WHAT TWO ACTUALLY COSTS, measured rather than predicted, because the first
 * version of this comment guessed and guessed wrong. It takes the five findings
 * to two: `lintong`'s documented duplication survives at 3 content words, and
 * `saurikissa`'s translate-lane repeat survives at 3. Dropped are two runs of
 * function words at 0 and 1, and `dogesir_`'s invented-and-repeated passage,
 * which carries only 1 content word in 21 characters.
 *
 * DROPPING `dogesir_` IS ACCEPTED rather than worked around. A five-word phrase
 * with one substantial word is short enough that two paragraphs sharing it is
 * unremarkable, and a stage emitting on every run should be quiet enough that a
 * finding means something. If document-scale damage is later found that this
