// What a size anomaly MEANS, which the first version of this instrument
// conflated into one bucket called `movedPairs`.
//
// THE MISTAKE THAT PRODUCED THIS FILE. A screen built to find relocation
// reported 44 pairs across the corpus, and the number went into `#107` and into
// Question 5. Hand-checking entries whose expansion was anomalous showed the
// bucket held at least four different phenomena, three of which are not
// relocation and one of which is not evidence at all. A single count over a
// mixture cannot be a floor on any of its parts.
//
// EVERYTHING HERE IS A CANDIDATE, never a verdict. Size cannot separate a
// relocation from an adjacent omission and addition that happen to balance, nor
// an untranslated section from a deliberately terse one. These names say where
// to look and what to look for; a reader decides.
