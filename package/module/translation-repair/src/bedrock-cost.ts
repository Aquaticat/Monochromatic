 The most one attempt could have been billed, off what it sent.

 A BOUND, NOT AN ESTIMATE (ledger P1, 2026-09-28). An attempt the endpoint
 accepted and this pipeline stopped reading reports no usage, and whether
 Bedrock bills output past a cancel is unmeasured (OpenRouter's endpoints
 were measured billing to the end, `completion-cap.ts`). This ledger is the
 only guard on the owner's card, where an under-read is the failure, so the
 attempt is priced at no more prompt tokens than its body had bytes and no
 more completion tokens than its `max_tokens`. Abandoned attempts were 874 of
 about 190,000 Bedrock calls in the logs, so the over-read is small.

 @param servedId - model the attempt went to, whose row carries the prices

 @param requestBodyBytes - size of the body the attempt sent

 @param maxTokens - `max_tokens` the body carried

 @returns Token counts and their price at the bound

 @example
 ```ts
 const bound = bedrockAttemptBound({ servedId: 'google.gemma-4-e2b', requestBodyBytes: 30_000, maxTokens: 1_149, },);
