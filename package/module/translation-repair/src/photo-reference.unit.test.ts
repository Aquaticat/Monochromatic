/**
 * Tests for reading which images a passage shows.
 *
 * WHAT THESE PIN is the reader that lets `#111` hand a stage the picture rather
 * than the markup naming it. Validated against the pinned corpus before these
 * were written: 380 references found, 380 present in the tree, none missing,
 * matching an independent count of the same construct.
 *
 * The stray-space case is not defensiveness. One reference in the corpus writes
 * the placeholder with a space before the directory, and a reader that missed it
 * would report that entry as showing one image fewer than it does, which is the
 * kind of quiet undercount that makes a later measurement wrong rather than
 * absent.
 *
 * The double-quote cases are the same lesson learnt again. Four source pages at
 * pin `a41fc607` quote their paths with double marks, seven paths in all, and a
 * reader that took single marks only sent one of them (BI4PBV, 2026-09-04)
 * through its picture stage with nothing to read and nothing to say about it.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
