/**
 Tests that a reply nested too deeply to read is refused by a floor before any
 parser reads it twice, in every stage a model's text enters that already has
 one, and that the voice's refusal is the stage's record of it.

 THE SHAPE UNDER TEST. A stage that reads a model's text through a parse with
 no catch ends, with that voice's work and every other voice's, on the plain
 grammar's refusal. These stages never reach such a parse with the deep text:
 the refine rewrite is read by its paragraph gate, the polish round by the
 same gate, the consolidation slate by the shape floor, the archive block
 revision by its shape check, and the archive text itself by the preparation
 that opens an entry. Each case has one voice write a reply 300 levels deep
 and the others write ordinary ones, and names the floor that refused it.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
