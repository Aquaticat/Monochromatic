 EXTRACTION PROPOSES, CONFIRMATION DISPOSES. A voice that answered the open
 question with an empty list never said the detail is false; it said it
 found none, which on Mio26 four of five voices did in a handful of tokens.
 Shown the quote pair, the same voice reads it. When nothing was extracted
 there is nothing to ask, and when nobody answers the confirmation the
 extraction's own quorum stands, so a silent hour cannot lose a detail the
 open question already carried.
