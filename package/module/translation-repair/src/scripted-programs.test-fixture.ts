//region Scripted programs
// A PROGRAM RUNNER THAT STARTS NO PROCESS, for cases about code that reaches
// for command-line tools. Every run the code under test asks for is recorded,
// and what each program does is a stand-in the case names: a decoder that
// copies its input, a reader that transcribes its input, a program that is
// not installed, a program that exits unhappy.
//
// TEST SUPPORT, NOT PACKAGE SOURCE.
//
// THE STAND-INS DO REAL FILE WORK, at the paths the code under test hands
// them, which are paths inside the scratch directory that code made for
// itself. So a case reads the wiring off the result: the words a reading
// carries are the bytes the case handed in only when the picture was written
// to the path the decoder was given, decoded to the path the reader was
// given, and read back from the stem the reader was given.
//
// THE TWO REJECTIONS COPY NODE'S OWN, field for field, as `promisify(execFile)`
// raised them on Node 26.10.0 when this was written: a plain `Error` with the
// spawn's fields written onto it, the way Node builds them, and no class of
// its own, since code that renders a caught value by its name prints `Error`
// for the real ones. Nothing here is trusted from that one measurement: the
// `runInstalledProgram` cases in `image-ocr.unit.test.ts` hold each one
// against the rejection the real runner raises, every time the file runs.
