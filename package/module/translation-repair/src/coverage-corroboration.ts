//region Coverage corroboration
// The second signature an insertion needs, which consults no model.
//
// `doc/decision/translation-repair-absence-verdict.md` requires TWO independent
// readings before anything is written into a page: the coverage roster must
// call the passage absent, AND the page must be measurably too short to hold
// it. A false insertion duplicates text in a memorial page, which is the
// expensive error; a missed one leaves a gap the archive already had.
//
// WHY A SIZE TEST SEPARATES THE CASE THE ROSTER CANNOT. The ambiguity the whole
// question turns on is a MERGE against an OMISSION: an aligner reports both as
// an unpaired source passage. A merge leaves the content somewhere in a page of
// ordinary length, so a merged page is not short. An omission leaves the page
// short by about what the passage would have contributed. The size test is
// blind to which passage is which and answers only "is this page missing
// roughly this much English", which is exactly the half the roster is weakest on.
//
// MEASURED, not tuned. See the decision document: over all 92 pinned pairs the
// ratio of English code points to source code points reads p5 1.42, p25 2.28,
// p50 2.65, p75 3.00, p95 4.52. The three entries where the roster refused to
// call any candidate covered are short of a median expectation by 8970, 676 and
// 10891 code points; the three where it called passages carried and noticed
// their deletion are OVER it by 322, 1484 and 1112. No overlap, and no
// threshold was fitted to produce that: the corpus median is used directly.
