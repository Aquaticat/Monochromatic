// What OpenRouter serves for this pipeline, and how it spells it.
//
// WHY THIS PROVIDER EXISTS IN THE PIPELINE. The owner, 2026-09-03: Charm Hyper
// ended its bundle subsidization and will not be recharged, Synthetic and
// Hyper are expected to run dry often, and OpenRouter is where the owner would
// rather pay per token. It is the third and last provider in `PROVIDER_ORDER`
// (`doc/decision/translation-repair-openrouter-fallback.md`).
//
// IT SERVES NO MODEL THE ROSTER DOES NOT ALREADY NAME. Every row here is a
// third spelling of a seat Synthetic or Hyper already reaches, so `sharedWith`
// is never absent and the roster identity in `roster-id.ts` is unchanged.
// Provider is not part of panelist identity; a slice judged by
// `moonshotai/kimi-k3` counts once, as `hf:moonshotai/Kimi-K3`.
//
// THE OWNER'S ALLOWLIST ON THE ACCOUNT carries all nine as of 2026-09-03; a
// row here that the account no longer allows answers a refusal at the wire,
// which is the loud failure this catalog prefers over a silent substitution.
//
// FIELDS WERE READ OFF THE PUBLIC MODELS LISTING on 2026-09-03
// (`GET https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models`, snapshot at
// `~/temp/agent/openrouter-models-20260903.json`): `architecture.input_modalities`
// for pictures and `top_provider.max_completion_tokens` for the ceiling. Under
// zero data retention and `require_parameters` the endpoint actually chosen may
// cap lower; the ceiling is recorded as the listing's, and the client sends no
// `max_tokens` unless a caller sets one, exactly as the Synthetic client does.

 Routing preferences every request carries in its `provider` field, before

 `zdr: true` IS THE OWNER'S DECISION of 2026-09-03: only endpoints with a
 zero-data-retention policy may serve a corpus passage, matching the stance
 taken on Charm Hyper. Every roster model kept at least seven such endpoints
 on the day of measurement.
 
 `require_parameters: true` keeps a request off any endpoint that does not
 support every parameter it carries, which for a schema'd call means
 `response_format`; an endpoint that ignored it would answer prose to a
 schema and cost a lost voice.
 
 `sort: 'price'` SINCE 2026-09-09, on the owner's instruction to stop
 bleeding. Between the top-up of 2026-09-08 and the refusal of 2026-09-09
 the default load balancing sent 3,894 of `deepseek-v4-pro-0813`'s calls
 to Parasail and CoreWeave at 1.85 and 2.11 times the listing's price
 (55.14 USD paid against 29.56 at listing), and the endpoints listing of
 2026-09-09 prices Baidu, Alibaba and DeepSeek at 0.58 to 0.66 USD per
 million in and 1.74 to 1.98 out against their 1.32 and 3.96. The routing
 page says sorting disables load balancing and picks the cheapest; the
 ignore list, zero data retention and `require_parameters` still apply,
 so the cheapest endpoint that keeps nothing and takes every parameter
 serves.
