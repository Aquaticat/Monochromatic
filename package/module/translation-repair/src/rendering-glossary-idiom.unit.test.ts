/**
 Guards class one hundred thirty (2026-09-25): under the owner's standing
 instruction of 2026-09-25 ("whenever you see anything that can be translated
 better do it"), nine more phrasings on one page join the rendering glossary.
 三剑客, 燃油车, 喘不过气, 密密麻麻, 志愿填写, 命运的齿轮, 相关医院, 巨大的影响 and
 贴贴计划 each shipped as a calque; the glossary seeds the English each should
 take and refuses the calques.

 The glossary audit of 2026-09-27 took out 相关医院 and 巨大的影响 (ordinary
 words joined by one sentence) for the idiomatic English rule, and dropped
 the refused forms of 三剑客, 喘不过气 and 密密麻麻 that are the right English
 for the same word elsewhere (`glossary-dictionary-terms.unit.test.ts`).

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
