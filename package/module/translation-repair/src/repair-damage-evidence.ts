// WHAT THE LANE CONTEST IS SHOWN of the introduced-defect probe: the
// corroborated claims of added damage against the repair lane's text, as
// evidence lines, so the judges that choose between the lanes see what the
// probe saw. Nothing acts on the claims; the probe stays in shadow mode
// (`introduced-defect-probe.ts`), and the judges weigh them as they weigh the
// passages.
//
// BOTH EDITS THE LANE MAKES. The accuracy repair is probed against the archive
// text (`introducedDefects`) and the naturalness rewrite against the repaired
// text (`refinementDefects`, present only where the rewrite shipped,
// `refine-slice-settle.ts`). The candidate the judges see is the text after
// both, so damage either edit added is damage in it. keyword233 on 2026-09-03
// (`~/temp/agent/keyword233-seats-20260903`): the rewrite moved a paragraph
// into the present tense, three probers corroborated it, and the contest chose
// against the repair 5 of 7 on that tense without being shown the claims,
// because only the accuracy probe was read then.
//
// MEASURED ON 2026-09-03 over the four landings that carried the probe: ten
// regions with a corroborated claim, six true (three of them the tense rule,
// which the contest that chose the damaged lane 7 of 7 never saw), three false
// (two misparse 我方才知道 as "our side", one calls 十几 "fifteen") and one
// borderline. That precision is why the claims are shown and not obeyed.
