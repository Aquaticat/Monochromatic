//region Repair unheard
// What it means for the repair lane to have heard nobody about a slice, named
// once so every reader asks the same question.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS ENDS, measured on a two-slice fixture whose every critic call
// failed: 48 attempts, quorum unmet 0 of 6 on each slice, and the lane reported
// `decided` at both. `decided` means the lane produced a wording. Here nobody
// was heard, so the archive's wording stood by DEFAULT rather than by anyone's
// choice, which is what `incumbent-fallback` exists to say. Recorded as it was,
// "critics examined this slice and found nothing" and "no critic answered at
// all" were the same row, and a provider outage during a corpus pass produced
// artifacts that read like clean runs.
//
// The signal was already there and nothing read it: the findings carry
// `stage-quorum-unmet (critic 0/6)` per slice, and `heardCriticIds` names who
// answered. This turns that into the per-slice outcome.
//
// WHY TWO STAGES AND NOT ONE. Critics are not the only voice that can produce a
// wording here: the naturalness lane rewrites a slice after the accuracy pass
// settles, and it can do so on a slice no critic ever raised anything about. A
// slice it rewrote HAS a wording somebody produced, so hearing nobody means
// both stages were silent, not just the critics.
