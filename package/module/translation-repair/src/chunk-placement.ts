//region Chunk placement
// What a chunk POINTS AT, which until now was always existing text and soon
// will not be. A source section with no translation at all has to name the
// place its translation belongs rather than a span of the target document, so
// the target side of a pair becomes either CONTENT, which is text that is
// there, or an INSERTION, which is a boundary where text is not.
//
// SPLIT FROM `chunk-document.ts` on purpose. That file is about carving a
// document into sections and pairing two documents' sections; this is about
// what one side of such a pair can BE, which every later stage reads and few
// of them construct.
//
// THE DISCRIMINANT IS A FIELD, not a shape. An insertion carries no nodes and
// no text, so `nodes.length === 0` would identify one today, and the
// constructors here cannot produce an empty content chunk: `chunkByHeadings`
// builds every group from at least one node and `runToChunk` throws on an
// empty run. But the exported type is structural, so any caller can fabricate
// an empty content chunk, and under a structural test that fabrication
// silently BECOMES an insertion. A field says what a value is rather than
// letting its emptiness decide.
//
// NOTHING PRODUCES AN INSERTION YET. `#100` lands the producers last, after
// assembly, the lanes and the caches can each consume one, so this file exists
// before its callers deliberately.
