/**
 * Tests for rendering a caught value without repeating what it refused.
 *
 * THE ABSENCE CASES ARE THE POINT, and one of them carries its own positive
 * control. V8 quotes the first ten characters of the text a `JSON.parse`
 * refusal was given, so the control asserts that the RAW message carries the
 * fixture word before the guarded case asserts that the rendered text does not.
 * Without the control, an assertion of absence would pass against a probe that
 * could never have shown a difference.
 *
 * MEASURED WHILE WRITING THESE: V8 quotes only where the text stops being JSON
 * near its start. A file truncated at its tail yields a positional message that
 * quotes nothing, so a fixture failing late would silently test nothing.
 *
 * Fixture wording is cat-themed invention, so no corpus content appears here.
