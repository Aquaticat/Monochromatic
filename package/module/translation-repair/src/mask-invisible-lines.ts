//region Invisible line masking
// Turns a line that shows nothing into a line that IS nothing, before the
// Markdown parser reads it.
//
// The corpus case: `people/Toka_ls/page.en.md` carries lines holding U+FEFF and
// nothing else, sitting between two ordinary sentences with no blank line
// anywhere near them. A line carrying a byte-order mark is not blank, so
// CommonMark reads it as a CONTINUATION and merges the paragraphs either side
// of it into one block. That translation therefore parses to 29 blocks against
// the original's 33, they track one-to-one until the first such line, and from
// there every English block pairs with the WRONG Chinese one.
//
// The damage is invisible to every later stage. Handed a source paragraph
// beside the wrong target paragraph, the editor rewrote a correct rendering of
// 期盼中，她看见光穿透暗影 into a faithful rendering of 尽管前路漫布荆棘, a
// sentence two blocks away. Both texts are fluent, both translate something the
// original really says, and the critics, checkers and probe all compare against
// whatever paragraph the misalignment handed them.
//
// Masking preserves LENGTH, exactly as `maskHtmlComments` does, because node
// text, quotes, hashes and every claim anchor are sliced from the original body
// by absolute offset. Replacing the character rather than removing the line is
// what lets the paragraph break come back without moving anything.

 *
 * The byte-order mark is the one that occurred. The rest are listed because
 * they fail identically: each shows nothing, each keeps a line from being

 *
 * Includes the CommonMark blanks, so this set answers one question only, "can a
 * reader see it", and blankness is asked separately against
 * {@link BLANK_TO_COMMONMARK}. Splitting the two questions is what keeps the
 * non-ASCII spaces from being skipped: U+00A0, U+202F and U+3000 are
 * ECMAScript whitespace, so any check phrased with `trim()` calls them empty
 * and passes over the very characters it exists to catch. That trap already
 * broke the first draft of this file once, with U+FEFF.
 *
 * Membership requires being invisible UNCONDITIONALLY, which is why three near
 * misses are absent. U+00AD renders as a hyphen wherever a line happens to
 * break; U+2028 and U+2029 carry line and paragraph meaning of their own.
 * Masking a line made only of one of those would be a judgement about
 * rendering rather than the restoration of a lost paragraph break, and
 * declining costs nothing but a weld nobody has observed.
