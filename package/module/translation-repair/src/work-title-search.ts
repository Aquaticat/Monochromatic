//
// NO SDK. The workspace bans `exa-js`; this is one `fetch` against `/search`,
// the request shape read off the reference on 2026-09-02
// (https://exa.ai/docs/reference/search): POST, `x-api-key` header, `query`,
// `type`, `numResults`, `contents.highlights` with its own `query` and
// `maxCharacters`; the response carries `results[]` with `title`, `url` and
// `highlights[]`. Exercised by hand the same day: 《活着》 answered "To Live",
// 《魔法少女小圆》 "Puella Magi Madoka Magica", about 1.5 s and $0.007 a query.
