//region Consolidation brief
// Renders what the lane contest's judges said about the two candidates, as the
// block a consolidating producer is shown.
//
// FINDINGS ARE CLAIMS, NOT FACTS. These are judge output, and judge output is
// exactly what `M3 fix D` had to teach the critic policy not to treat as
// golden. A producer that obeys a false finding introduces a defect this
// pipeline authored itself, which is worse than the one it was sent to fix. So
// the brief presents each judge's reading as something to check against the
// original, and the sheet says so in as many words.
//
// ONE BLOCK PER JUDGE rather than two pooled lists. A judge that names a
// candidate and nothing else, `unsupported: ["repair"]`, has put the substance
// of its finding in its reason, and pooling the lists separates the two. Every
// bare name would arrive detached from what it was about.
//
// JUDGES ARE NUMBERED, NOT NAMED. Which model said what is not evidence about
// the passage, and naming them invites a producer to weigh a finding by its
// author. `self-preference.ts` exists because that weighing is measurable.
