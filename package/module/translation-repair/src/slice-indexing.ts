// The one property every splice, every lane result and every cross-lane
// comparison rests on: a prepared slice's index is its position in the
// preparation, and both of its sides agree about it.
//
// It is not enforced anywhere else, and it is not obvious from the code that
// produces it. `chunkByHeadings` stamps a SECTION index, `alignDocumentSections`
// pairs sections whose two indices need not match, and only `subdivideChunkPair`
// restamps both sides from a running counter. Three stampings with three
// meanings reach one field called `sliceIndex`, so which one a given chunk
// carries depends on where it came from. `#99` reshapes that; this checks the
// invariant the reshape has to preserve, and would catch the reshape breaking it.

 * preparation never has to trust the arithmetic it handed out, and both sides
 * of a pair are stamped from one value rather than twice from the same
 * expression.

 * @param slicePosition - position this pair holds in the whole preparation

/**
 * Refuses a slice list whose indices are not their own positions.
 *
 * THREE THINGS ARE CHECKED, and each is assumed somewhere that cannot check it
 * for itself:
 *
 * -   BOTH SIDES AGREE. `settleTranslateSlice` reads the target side's index and
 *     `spliceSlices` keys on it alone, so a source side carrying some other
 *     number is unchecked everywhere it is used. Section pairing can produce
 *     exactly that, since a forced pair joins section 4 to section 6.
 * -   INDICES ARE POSITIONS. The lane results name slices by the index, and
 *     assembly maps replacements back through it, so a duplicate would let one
 *     slice's text be spliced over another's span while a gap would make a
 *     range check pass while naming a slice that does not exist. The cache key
 *     no longer carries it, since version 26 and translate version 2, which is
 *     why a resumed record is stamped with the index it was asked under.
 * -   ORDER IS DOCUMENT ORDER, which is the same statement read forwards: it is
 *     what lets a reader compare two lanes slice by slice without carrying
 *     offsets around.
 *
 * AN ASSERTION BESIDE A CONSTRUCTION, since `prepareDocumentPair` now restamps
 * every slice with {@link reindexSlicePair} rather than trusting the base index
 * it handed to subdivision. From that path this cannot fail, which is the
 * point: it fails if the restamp is changed or removed, and it is the only
 * check any OTHER producer of slice pairs has. The probes, the benches and the
 * census each subdivide with a base index of their own.
 *
 * @param slices - prepared slice pairs in document order
 *
 * @throws {@link SliceIndexingError} when the two sides of a slice disagree, or
 * an index is not its own position
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * assertSliceIndexing({ slices, },);
