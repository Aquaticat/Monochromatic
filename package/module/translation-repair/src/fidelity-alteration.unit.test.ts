/**
 * Tests for the ends of the two helpers that decide WHICH number a fidelity
 * probe may damage.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The probe damages a passage on purpose so the critics
 * can be scored on whether they catch it, which means the damage has to sit
 * somewhere the text really carries. Two ends decide that and were measured on
 * 2026-08-25 to decide nothing any case asserts: the scan bound that closes a
 * digit run ending the passage, and the floor that says how short a number may
 * be and still count as one both sides state.
 *
 * `unsupportedVariant`, which chooses the wrong number to put there, is pinned
 * in `fidelity-alteration-variant.unit.test.ts` beside this.
 *
 * BOTH FAILURES ARE SILENT. A run left unclosed, or a number refused at the
 * floor, is a number the probe never damages, so the entry scores as clean
 * while carrying an untested claim rather than reporting that it found nothing
 * to damage.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
 *
