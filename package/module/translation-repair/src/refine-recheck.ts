//region Refine recheck
// The checker round a refined slice passes before its rewrite may ship: the
// naturalness lane's rollback gate (ledger L11).
//
// SPLIT OUT OF `refine-slice-settle.ts` for the file-length cap when the gate

/**
 Whether a refinement kept every issue the checkers had already confirmed,
 and made no accepted issue `T1` leaves open worse.

 Rolls back the WHOLE slice when it did not. Checkers report per ISSUE while
 refinement happens per paragraph, and an issue can span paragraphs, so which
 paragraph broke a given issue is not derivable from what the checker returns.
 The regressed issue is named in the findings so a later session can judge
 whether finer attribution is worth building.

 @param client - injected model client

 @param checkerModelIds - checkers as seated at the stage

 @param outcome - settled accuracy outcome for this slice, carrying who wrote
 the repaired text this rewrote

 @param refineContributors - models whose rewrite won, empty when none did

 @param sourceText - original chunk text

 @param refinedText - candidate text the refinement produced

 @param identityContext - declared names and handles, when any (ledger L14)

 @param referenceContext - what the pages the original cites say, when it
 cites any (ledger L14)

 @param signal - caller abort honored by every exchange

 @param perCallTimeoutMs - deadline per exchange

 @param l - pipeline logger

 @returns Whether refinement may ship, plus the checker stage's own findings
 and the recheck's verdict as findings

 AN OPEN ISSUE IS ROLLED BACK ON ONE WORSE BALLOT, the threshold the owner
 ruled for a patch's unconfirmed edits the same day (ledger L3): the checkers
 were never going to call an issue the patch did not fix `fixed`, so
 `not-fixed` is the text as it stood and `worse` is the only verdict that
 says the rewrite damaged it. A `fixed` ballot credits nothing; the round is
 a rollback gate, and a resolution it recorded would rest on a round no panel
 or selection ever weighed.

 A ROUND SHORT OF ITS QUORUM ROLLS BACK TOO, under `refine-recheck-unheard`
 and whatever its ballots say: the gate passes a rewrite only on a round the
 checker stage closed at quorum, which is the rule the package's other gates
 between a new text and a standing one keep (the consolidation gate and the
 polish gate each ship the standing text unless two ballots name the new
 one).

 SO DOES AN ISSUE SHORT OF THAT QUORUM in a round that met it: an issue the
 round cast fewer ballots on than the checker stage closed on is named under
 `refine-recheck-unheard` with its count, whatever those ballots say, and is
 never read as regressed or worsened. An issue that was heard and broke rolls
 back beside it under `refine-rolled-back`.
