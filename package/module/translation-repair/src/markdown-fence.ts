//region Markdown fence
// Choosing a code fence no enclosed text can close.
//
// Grading sheets interpolate corpus prose and model output into Markdown, which
// is a destination grammar, not a display surface. A replacement is arbitrary
// text: it can contain backticks, a line starting with `###`, or a literal
// `- repair grade: [ ]`. Interpolated raw, the first breaks the block, the
// second invents a heading, and the third puts a grade box on the sheet that
// nobody wrote. Curly quotation marks around it change nothing, because quotes
// are not Markdown syntax.
//
// The fence is chosen against the content rather than fixed, for the same
// reason `candidate-select-wire.ts` chooses its prompt fence against candidate
// text: a fixed fence lets the content close its own block and have the rest
// read as sheet.
