//region Fidelity splice
// Removing a sentence WITHOUT LEAVING A MARK, which the fidelity fixtures need
// and a plain deletion does not give.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. A sentence is stored trimmed, and prose separates sentences
// with whitespace on both sides, so cutting the sentence alone leaves both
// separators behind. Measured on the fixture text: a mid-paragraph deletion left
// a DOUBLE SPACE at the join, and deleting a trailing paragraph left THREE
// CONSECUTIVE NEWLINES. Either is a typographic edit-mark a judge can see
// without reading a word of the original, which would let the damaged candidate
// lose on tidiness rather than on coverage, and coverage is the only ground the
// trial means to test.
//
// WHY NOT FIX `applySeededErrors`. The recall benchmark and the introduced-defect
// probe seed the same way and are measured against what those seeds do today;
// changing the shared primitive would move their numbers for a reason that
// belongs to this trial alone.
//
// THE JOIN RULE, which is what makes the result read as text nobody edited:
// remove the sentence and ONE of the two whitespace runs around it, keeping
// whichever run the surrounding structure needs. At the end of the text the
// trailing run stays, at the start the leading one does, and in the middle the
// STRONGER run stays, where stronger means more line breaks. A paragraph deleted
// from the middle therefore leaves one paragraph break rather than two, and a
// sentence deleted from a paragraph leaves one space.
