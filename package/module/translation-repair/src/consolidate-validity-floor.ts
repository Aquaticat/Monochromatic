//region Consolidation validity floor
// REFUSES A SLATE CARRYING NO STRUCTURALLY VALID PROPOSAL, before the gate is
// asked which rendering is more faithful.
//
// The policy is not chosen here, it is inherited. `translate-produce.ts` says
// invalid renderings go back to their authors and THE DISTINCT SURVIVORS
// become a slate with the incumbent among them, so a candidate that failed
// validation is not a slate member. It separately exempts the incumbent from
// the validity check, because a check that could drop it would be a check that
// could delete the archive. Together those give one answer: when nothing
// survives, the slate is the incumbent alone.
//
// MEASURED, NOT ANTICIPATED. `Zha_Ke#1` finished the repair round with five
// candidates and zero valid ones, in both runs of the band pair, and a
// consolidation shipped at both. The page there is two blocks; two candidates
// produced one block, one produced the wrong element kind, and the rest did
// not parse as MDX. The guard refused all five and the slice shipped one
// anyway. `doc/planning/the-third-rendering.md` records it.
//
// WHY BEFORE THE GATE RATHER THAN AFTER: the gate answers which of two
// renderings is more faithful to the original, and that question has no
// meaning when one of them is structurally not the page it would be written
// into. Asking it anyway buys ballots about a candidate that cannot ship.
