/**
 * Tests for the semantic wrap applied to shipped text.
 *
 * WHAT THESE PIN is the property the whole change rests on: the fix is
 * ADD-ONLY. Every passage a lane produces goes through it without anybody
 * reading them first, which is only safe because it cannot delete, move or join
 * anything. A rule that rewrote text instead of inserting into it would be a
 * silent editor sitting after every judge in the pipeline.
 *
 * The second thing they pin is idempotence, which is what lets this run on a
 * cache replay. A resumed slice is wrapped on the way OUT of the cache, so a
 * pool written before this existed needs no migration, and a slice already
 * wrapped has to come back unchanged.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
