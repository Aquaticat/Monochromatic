//region Stage windowed rounds
// THE WINDOW FOR THE STAGES THAT READ THEIR OWN ROUND. Six stages ask their
// bench through `runGatherRound` directly and read every seat's outcome
// themselves, lost seats included, because what they record is a seat per
// outcome: the lane contest, section pairing, block pairing, the consolidation
// gate, the naturalness review and the polish gate. They never retried a lost
// voice; they asked everyone once, and on the first `noname` pass of
// 2026-09-09 that was 356 seats (lane contest 96, naturalness review 104,
// gate 72, polish 48, pairing 36) for quorums of about half. This is
// `stage-fanout-window.ts` applied to them: quorum plus one seat first, in
// the prompt's rotation, the rest only when a voice is lost, up to
// `STAGE_RETRY_ROUNDS` retry rounds these stages did not have before. A seat
// that answered unreadably is not re-asked, as before, nor is a seat the
// router refused, whose place in its round passes to the next pending seat.
//
// ONE OUTCOME PER SEAT ASKED, IN ROSTER ORDER. A seat lost in one round and
// heard in the next appears once, heard; a seat the window spared does not
// appear at all, so a caller recording a seat per outcome never counts the
// same seat twice and never records a silence nobody was asked to break.
