//region Assembly adjacent repetition
// THE DOCUMENT-SCALE CHECK CANNOT SEE THE DAMAGE IT WAS BUILT FOR, which is why
// this file exists beside it rather than inside it.
//
// `findIntroducedRepetitions` requires a phrase to carry two words of at least
// five letters before it will report anything. That gate is load-bearing at
// DOCUMENT scale, where any two distant sentences may share ordinary phrasing,
// and removing it took a measured reading back to mostly noise.
//
// `#107`'s own example does not clear it. The duplication `lintong` shipped
// across slices 2 and 3 is six words of twenty-three characters whose word
// lengths are 4,3,3,2,3,3, so it carries no content word at all and the shipped
// check reports nothing on the defect it was written to catch.
//
// ADJACENCY IS THE SPECIFICITY. Two consecutive slices shipping the same
// wording, which the archive did not repeat, is a much narrower claim than two
// distant passages agreeing, so it needs no content gate to stay quiet.
// Measured over every settled artifact carrying a delivery ledger, this fires
// once in twenty-two lane readings, and that once is the documented damage.
// `doc/audit/an-archive-rebuilt-from-the-ledger-is-not-the-archive.md` records
// the measurement.
