/**
 Tests for grouping an aligned block pair into budget-bounded slice runs.

 The grouping had no test. It is read here through `groupNodesSealed` with
 nothing sealed (`group-aligned.test-fixture.ts`, ledger B30), the function
 the slicing calls. Its contract is a coverage claim: the runs
 cover every block on both sides exactly once. That claim is what makes the
 rest of the pipeline safe, because a slice's text is cut from its first to
 its last offset, so a block left out of a run is NOT left out of the text the
 critics read. It is only left out of the record of what the slice was built
 from, which means a claim anchored to it has nowhere to land.

 So the coverage invariant gets asserted on every shape in this file rather than
 once, and the module's own stated exception, an entirely one-sided section,
 is asserted as the exception it is.

 A walk handed over whole is read off `groupNodesSealed` itself: its whole
 result where the walk is well formed, and its refusal where a step names a
 block its side lacks or no step names a block, each of which once grouped a
 section to nothing.

 Fixtures go through `parseDocument`, so the nodes carry the offsets and text
 the aligner really scores on rather than offsets I chose to make a case pass.
 Cat-themed invention throughout.
