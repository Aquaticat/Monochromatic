// THE ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTH CLASS (CuspariaKLSY9, 2026-09-23). The
// consolidation polish gate's two policies were fidelity-first and carried no
// house rule, so when GLM-5.3-Flash's polish moved the seven lines of a life
// that has ended into the past tense, as the house rule sets, the gate refused
// it 4 of 4 as "an unsupported change in meaning" about "a living person". The
// slate before it had split 1.5 to 1 to 1 among past-tense candidates against
// the minimum of 2, so the present-tense standing shipped. Every other judging
// sheet has carried `JUDGE_POLICY_BLOCK` since the seventy-sixth class; the
// polish gate joins them, with the tense point made where the gate reads it.

 What makes a polish better when its English is no more idiomatic: it brings
 the base into line with a house rule.

 WRITTEN AGAINST TWO POLICIES THAT NEVER PREFERRED IT (ledger S11). The
 comparative policy preferred polished only when it was "clearly more
 idiomatic", so a polish whose one change was the past tense for a life that
 has ended read as no improvement; the objection policy chose base for any
 change "the ORIGINAL does not ask for", which a house correction is.

 @example
 ```ts
 const policy = `Otherwise choose base. ${HOUSE_CORRECTION_IS_AN_IMPROVEMENT}`;
 ```
 */
export const HOUSE_CORRECTION_IS_AN_IMPROVEMENT: string = 'A HOUSE CORRECTION IS AN IMPROVEMENT. Where polished '
  + 'differs from the base by bringing it into line with a house rule (the past tense for a life that has ended, '
  + 'singular they for a TA, English for a word left in Han, Canadian spelling, a month-first date, shorthand '
  + 'spelled out), that change adds and drops nothing and is one the house rules ask for: prefer polished for it '
  + 'when the two are otherwise equally faithful, even where its English is no more idiomatic.';

/**
 House rules the polish gate reads after its fidelity policy: the tense the
 house rule sets is not a change of meaning, and the rest of the block.

 @example
 ```ts
 const system = `${COMPARATIVE_POLISH_POLICY}\n\n${POLISH_GATE_HOUSE_RULES}`;
 ```
 */
export const POLISH_GATE_HOUSE_RULES: string = `A TENSE THE HOUSE RULES SET IS NOT A CHANGE OF MEANING. The Chinese marks no tense, so a polished text that moves the narrative of a life that has ended into the past tense, or holds one tense where the base mixed two, has added nothing and dropped nothing; choose base over it only for a fault of another kind. The person these pages remember has died; a present-tense line about their life in the base is a tense the house rules correct, never a fact the polish contradicts and never a reason to keep the base.
