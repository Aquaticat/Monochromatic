// The response schema, restated inside the system prompt.
//
// THE OWNER ASKED FOR THIS DIRECTLY: "Some model/provider pairs can behave
// badly w/o a detailed system prompt, including but not limited to giving wrong
// tool call formats", and "please make sure to put even the full tool schema
// into system prompts". Before `#216` not one of the seventeen modules that
// build a `role: 'system'` message mentioned the shape it expects back. The
// schema travelled as the API-level `response_format` field and nowhere else,
// so a model that does not honour that field had nothing to go on.
//
// DERIVED FROM THE VALUE ON THE WIRE, never hand-copied. A second spelling of
// the schema would drift from the first the day either changed, and a prompt
// that describes a shape the request no longer asks for is worse than a prompt
// that describes none.
//
// APPLIED AT THE `chatJson` SEAM rather than in each prompt builder. That seam
// is where the messages and the response format are both in hand, and it is the
// only place where "every call carrying a schema states it" can be true by
// construction. Seventeen edits would have left the seventeenth to be
// remembered, and the eighteenth prompt to be written without it.
//
// IDEMPOTENT, so a call that passes through more than one seam, or a re-route
// that rebuilds a request, states the schema once.
