//region Worse-voted strip
// LEDGER L3, the owner's ruling of 2026-09-28 ("Revert worse-voted,
// recheck"): a selected patch carried edits whose issues the checkers did not
// confirm (345 of 2,148 patches over every run, 18 of 51 on TianqiChen666),
// and TianqiChen66616 slice 3 shipped one a checker had voted worse. An edit
// whose issue the checkers did not confirm and which drew at least one worse
// ballot is stripped (58 issues in 31 patches over every run), and the
// reduced patch faces one more checker round, and the introduced-defect
// probe, before it ships. An unconfirmed edit with no worse ballot stays.
//
// ONE ROUND, NEVER A LADDER, as the recovery round is: the recheck's tallies
// settle the chunk whatever they say, and nothing is stripped a second time.
//
// THE ENVELOPE IS THE UNIT. An edit replaces a whole envelope, and an
// envelope serving a worse-voted issue beside a confirmed one goes whole: the
// checker voted the text that edit wrote worse, whichever issue it answered.
