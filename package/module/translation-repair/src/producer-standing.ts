// HOW OFTEN EACH MODEL'S WRITING IS PREFERRED, counted from the rounds the
// selection already recorded rather than from a fresh contest.
//
// WHAT THIS IS FOR. The roster carries ten models and the writers stay at
// three, chosen by measurement. `roster-bench.ts` answers a question about
// WIDTH; this answers the question about WHO, off the same rounds, because a
// round already names who wrote each candidate and carries every ballot cast
// over that slate.
//
// ONLY DISINTERESTED BALLOTS COUNT, and that is the whole design. A producer
// judging its own candidate is measured to favour it, which is why selection
// discounts that vote at all. Counting self-votes into a standing would rank
// the most self-confident model first rather than the best-written one, and
// the calibration would then seat exactly the models least able to tell.
// `self-preference.ts` makes the same argument for the same reason and shares
// the stakeholder reading, so neither file invents its own idea of a stake.
//
// `SelectionBallot.selfVote` DOES NOT ANSWER THIS, though it looks as if it
// might. That flag says whether a judge named text it produced; the question
// here is whether a judge holds a stake in ONE PARTICULAR candidate, whichever
// way it voted. A judge with a stake in candidate 1 that votes for candidate 2
// carries `selfVote: false` and must still be excluded from candidate 1's
// tally, because its opinion of its own rival is not disinterested.
//
// COUNTS, NOT RATES. A rate hides its own evidence: three candidates winning
// three times reads identically to forty winning forty, and only one of those
// should decide a roster. Whoever reports divides, and has the denominator in
// hand to say whether the division means anything.
//
// A COMPOSITE CREDITS EVERY CONTRIBUTOR, since the candidate is their joint
// work. An incumbent credits the models collapsed into it and nobody else: the
// archive is not a roster member, so an incumbent standing alone credits no
// one, which is correct rather than a gap.
