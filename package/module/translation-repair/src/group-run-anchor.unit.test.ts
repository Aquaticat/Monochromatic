/**
 * Tests for where an insertion is anchored once the runs have settled.
 *
 * THE ANCHOR AND THE SPAN USED TO DESCRIBE THE SAME BYTES. `anchorOffsets`
 * reads the monotone walk, which describes the layout right up until
 * `mergeOneSidedRuns` folds an unclaimed translation block into a neighbour. A
 * run's span is cut from its first node to its last, so absorbing that block
 * stretches the span over it, and an anchor naming its start then points into
 * the middle of a passage. `assertPlacementLayout` refused the whole document:
 * 431 of 910 randomised reader-legal pairings over the pinned corpus.
 *
 * THE SMALLEST CASE IS TWO PARAGRAPHS AGAINST TWO, which is what these use.
 * Pair only the first, and the second original becomes an insertion while the
 * second translation folds into the first run.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention mirroring corpus structure only.
