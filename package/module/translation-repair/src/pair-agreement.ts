// WHICH PAIRS THE ROSTER AGREED ON, counted over every usable voice.
//
// `#245`: both pairing stages tallied votes over every reply but took their
// candidates from the FIRST usable reply alone, so a correspondence two other
// voices named was dropped whenever the first voice omitted it, and which
// pairs survived depended on which seat answered usably first. Agreement is
// per pair: a pair named by enough voices survives whoever named it.
//
// SECTION PAIRS ARE STRICTLY INCREASING. Block pairs are monotone and may stay
// on one side while the other advances, because paragraph splits and merges are
// first-class correspondences in `pair-blocks-wire.ts`. A repeated-side set is
// kept only when enough voices named its members together, so alternatives from
// disjoint replies do not become invented many-to-many structure.
//
// A TARGET TWO SOURCES CLAIM WITHOUT CORROBORATION IS DECIDED BY VOTES, in
// `pair-contested-target.ts`, the mirror of one source named against two
// targets. Deciding it by source order paired the first `noname` original's
// `## 简介` heading with the archive's opening paragraph and left the paragraph
// pair on the floor as "non-monotone".
