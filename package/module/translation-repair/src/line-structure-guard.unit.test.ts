/**
 Tests for the fault that names a flattened line-structured rendering.

 WHAT THESE PIN is the shape the corpus measurement forced. The recorded
 prescription was a line-count check against the original; measured over the
 211 line-structured slices of the pinned corpus, the archive's own English
 matches its Chinese line for line on only 115, and 80 of the 96 that differ
 carry MORE lines, because an English rendering of Chinese verse legitimately
 expands. So the check names a SHORTFALL and nothing else, and the case that
 proves it is the one accepting a longer rendering.

 The blind spot has a test of its own rather than a comment, so a later
 instrument that closes it fails here and has to say so.

 Fixtures take the original in Simplified Chinese as every source in this
 corpus is. Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
