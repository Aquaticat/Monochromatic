// WHY A METER IN THE PROCESS AND NOT ONLY IN THE LOG. `spend-line.ts` writes
// every call's cost where a reader can total it afterwards, and
// `corpus-run/spend-report.ts` is that reader. Neither can stop anything: the
// owner asked on 2026-09-04 for a per-run ceiling that refuses to START new
// entries once a run has spent its allowance, and a ceiling needs the running
// total while the run is still running. A meter the provider serves would do,
// but the OpenRouter credits meter is a balance, which auto top-up refills, so
// it cannot say what THIS run spent.
//
// PROCESS-WIDE STATE, DELIBERATELY. A run is a process, every call in it
// reports through `reportSpend`, and the ceiling is asked from one place. The
// mutable record is the whole of the state and nothing else reads it; tests
// reset it between cases.
//
// USD ONLY. Synthetic bills nothing per call and Hyper's credits are its own
// unit, so only calls that carried a `cost=` count here, and the total is a
// floor for the same reason the spend report's is: a cut stream reports no
// cost.
