//region Section chunking
// Some documents send thinking models into token-ceiling spirals (run 4,
// live), while section-scale units complete in ~30 s with quality output, so
// sections bound each call's blast radius. Memorial pages open blocks with
// `##` headings on both sides; a chunk is one heading plus every node until
// the next heading, and nodes before the first heading form a preamble
// chunk. Alignment is automatic and PARTIAL: sides of equal shape pair by
// index, and anything else goes to the forced heading aligner, which pairs
// what the headings support and REFUSES the rest. A refused section has no
// pair, and is named in a finding.
//
// IT USED TO BE TOTAL, by degrading to proportional monotone merging over
// cumulative character fractions, and that is exactly why it is not any
// more: merging produced a confident WRONG pairing that slid a whole
// document by two sections, so every critic call read the wrong original and
// every issue filed on that entry was noise. Leaving a section unpaired
// cannot damage it; guessing its pair damages text that was correct.

// Re-exported rather than defined here, so every consumer that already reads a
// chunk from this file keeps its import while the shapes themselves live in
// `chunk-placement.ts`. A contiguous run of nodes is what this file BUILDS; a
// place where nodes are missing is not, and that distinction is the whole
// reason the two kinds are declared apart from the carving that produces one
// of them.
