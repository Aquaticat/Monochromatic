//region Judge fidelity trial
// Whether the translate lane's judges can tell a faithful rendering from one
// that reads just as well and says less.
//
// WHY IT CANNOT BE READ OFF A CORPUS RUN. In production the judges decide
// between an incumbent and fresh renderings, and NOTHING KNOWS WHICH IS
// BETTER: that is the question they are being asked. A run therefore reports
// how often they replaced the archive, never how often they were right to. The
// trial supplies the missing half by constructing the answer.
//
// THE FIXTURES ARE BUILT BY `fidelity-damage.ts` from a real slice of the
// archive, and the damaged text is otherwise word for word the clean text. That
// is what makes either one the right adversary: it cannot lose on fluency,
// register or house style, only on saying what the original says, which is the
// first criterion the sheet names.
//
// TWO DEFECTS, BECAUSE ONE CANNOT SEPARATE READING FROM LENGTH. A deletion makes
// the complete candidate the longer one in every arrangement, so a roster that
// simply prefers more text scores perfectly on it. An insertion splices a
// sentence borrowed from elsewhere in the same document, so the correct answer
// is the SHORTER candidate. A roster that passes both is not reading length.
//
// BOTH DIRECTIONS ARE RUN over the same pair, because one direction alone cannot
// tell a judge that reads from a judge that simply keeps what it is given.
// Preserving is right when the incumbent is the clean text and wrong when it is
// the damaged one, so a status-quo reflex scores half and a reader scores both.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT MEASURE: self-preference, since neither candidate is written
// by a model on the roster, and fluency-versus-faithfulness in the hard case,
// since both fixtures move a whole sentence rather than quietly dropping a
// qualifier inside one. Both are recorded in `#84`.
