//region Container integrity
// What this guards changed once the defect it was built for was fixed at its
// origin, so read the current shape rather than the history.
//
// `flattenContainers` promotes a disclosure element's children to top-level
// blocks so both language sides expose comparable structure. That USED to leave
// the element's own opening and closing tags belonging to no block at all, and
// since every range in this package is minted from block offsets, a slice range
// could hold one tag and stop short of the other. Assembly replaces a range and
// copies the rest through, so such a range deleted the opener, kept the closer,
// and produced a page that lost the element's contents and carried markup
// closing nothing. Measured once on a corpus entry: 4388 characters became 680.
//
// `container-extents.ts` fixed that at the origin: the block carrying a
// container's opening tag now owns it, and the block carrying its closing tag
// owns that one. A tag is therefore inside some block, a range is a union of
// whole blocks, and a range that holds half a tag cannot be minted.
//
// SO THE RULE IS NO LONGER "BOTH TAGS OR NEITHER". That rule described a world
// where tags floated between blocks, and enforcing it now would refuse the
// ordinary healthy case: a container whose blocks fall in different slices puts
// its opening tag in the first slice's own text and its closing tag in the
// last's, each lane sees its tag and reproduces it, and the page stays
// balanced. A lane that drops one is a CANDIDATE fault, caught where the page
// grammar is read, not a preparation fault.
//
// What is checked instead is the property the origin fix establishes: every tag
// of a container that holds blocks lies wholly inside one of them, and no slice
// range ends part way through a tag. Both fire only on a regression in how
// extents or ranges are derived, which is exactly what they are for.
