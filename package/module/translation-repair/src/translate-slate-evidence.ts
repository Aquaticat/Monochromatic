// WHAT THE TRANSLATE SLATE SHOWS BESIDE ITS CANDIDATES, in one place so the
// rendered-sheets fixture renders what `judgeTranslateSlate` sends rather than
// a copy that can drift from it (ledger B28). Moved from `translate-judge.ts`
// unchanged.

/**
 Evidence the translate slate shows beside its candidates: the original, then
 each context block the caller has.

 @param sourceText - original slice text

 @param pictureContext - corroborated readings of the pictures the passage
 shows, omitted when there are none

 @param neighbouringSourceText - original of the sections either side,
 omitted unless the caller asked for the wider window

 @param neighbouringIncumbentText - archive English of the sections either
 side, omitted unless the caller asked for the wider window

 @param identityContext - declared names from both sides' front matter,
 omitted when neither declares anything

 @param referenceContext - what the pages the original cites say, omitted
 when it cites none

 @param archiveDisputeNote - why the incumbent shown is the repair lane's
 stand-in, omitted on an undisputed slice

 @returns Labelled evidence entries, in the order the judges read them

 @example
 ```ts
 const evidence = translateSlateEvidence({ sourceText, identityContext, },);
 ```
