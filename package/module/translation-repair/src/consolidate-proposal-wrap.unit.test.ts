/**
 Tests for wrapping consolidation proposals before the slate is built.
 
 THE DEFECT THIS FILE EXISTS TO STOP is both deciders approving bytes the run
 then changes. `wrapConsolidation` used to be the only wrap on this path, and
 it runs AFTER the slate judges have chosen a rendering and the gate has
 approved it, so what shipped was not what either of them read. Measured over
 the two most recent runs of the band pair's six entries, 15 of the 16
 consolidations that shipped came back from that wrap altered.
 
 WHAT THIS FILE COVERS is the wrapper alone, as a function. What the STAGE does
 with it is `consolidate-slate-carries-shipping-text.unit.test.ts`, and the
 two are apart for a diagnostic reason rather than a tidiness one: the runner
 abandons a whole FILE once a describe in it fails, so end-to-end cases sharing
 a file with unit cases go unrun exactly when something has broken and their
 answer matters most.
 
 THE INVARIANT BOTH FILES SERVE: a candidate on the slate is the text that
 ships if it wins. Proposals arrive wrapped, the incumbent arrives untouched,
 and a governed slice arrives exactly as its producers wrote it.
 
 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
