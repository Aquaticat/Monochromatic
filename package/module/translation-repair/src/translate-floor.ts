//region Translate floor
// THE SIXTY-SIXTH CLASS (XingZ615, 2026-09-19). The translate lane sends a
// candidate the deterministic publication rule refuses back to its author
// once (the owner's decision of 2026-08-15), and kept it on the slate when
// the revision failed too, on the reading that the original was at least
// what the model produced with the whole sheet in front of it. The judges
// do not apply the rule: on the closing poem they chose the rendering that
// moved the attribution line out of the quote (three blocks against the
// original's two) over two renderings that kept it, the lane contest
// flagged the winner "retryable" and moved on, and the consolidation
// withheld it as the standing with nothing valid left to ship. A text the
// rule refuses cannot reach the page, so after its turn it is withheld from
// the judges and kept as a finding; the repair turn and the model's own
// defence are unchanged.

/**
 Withholds from the slate every candidate the deterministic publication rule
 still refuses after its repair turn.

 @param voices - candidates as the repair turn left them

 @param sourceText - original slice

 @param incumbentText - incumbent the stage judges, which the rule reads as
 the page shape: the archive's rendering, or on a disputed slice the repair
 lane's text standing in its place where that may stand

 @param syntax - syntax role of the slice, when it has one

 @param lineStructured - whether the slice owes one line per line

 @param declared - name pairs the front matter declares, which the rule
 reads for a linked title naming a declared person (class one hundred
 fourteen); none leaves that floor silent

 @param disputedWordings - wordings a disputed slice refuses, so a candidate
 copying the archive there is withheld (owner, 2026-09-27); none elsewhere

 @param l - stage logger, which names each candidate withheld: the finding
 reaches only the artifact, and a slate thinned with nothing in the log reads
 as judges choosing among fewer voices (ledger E5)

 @returns Candidates the rule accepts, with a finding per candidate withheld

 @throws {@link import('./translate-floor-ground.ts').FloorGroundDisagreementError}
 when the rule says it compared nothing, which the stage rules out before
 any candidate is written (ledger B43)

 ```ts
 const floored = floorTranslateVoices({ voices, sourceText, incumbentText, lineStructured, l, },);
