//region Target-only run
// ENGLISH THE ARCHIVE CARRIES THAT THE CHINESE NEVER SAID, held out of
// translation and spliced back unchanged.
//
// WHAT GOES WRONG WITHOUT THIS. The translate lane writes each slice fresh from
// its source. Where a human translator transcribed an image into the English,
// that transcript has no source counterpart, so the lane produces nothing for
// it and the shipped slice simply does not contain it. Measured on the pool
// settled 2026-08-18: `dogesir_` slice 3 went from 1766 archive characters to
// 215 shipped, losing a 1487-character transcript, and `wangzihao980` slice 4
// went from 1228 to 175, losing 1098. Both are memorial pages and the lost
// blocks are the accessible reading of an image. Nothing recovers them.
//
// THIS IS THE `A` HALF OF THE PICTURE DECISION, whose authorized answer is "B, but best
// effort, fallback to A whenever an image's OCR doesn't make sense". `B` sends
// the image so the transcript has a source that can be CHECKED. `A` protects
// the block structurally. `A` is built first because it is what makes the
// failure of `B` survivable, and because it is correct on its own: a passage
// nobody can check is still a passage nobody may delete.
//
// THE ANCHOR IS A MARKUP BLOCK RATHER THAN A RATIO. Both measured cases end
// their source with a component, `<PhotoScroll photos={[...]} />`, which the
// archive repeats because markup is not prose. The archive then continues past
// where the source ended. So the rule is: find the last archive block that
// repeats the source's OWN LAST BLOCK, and treat what follows in the archive as
// target-only. No length ratio, no baseline, no threshold to tune.
//
// COMPARED WITH WHITESPACE COLLAPSED, and that is not a convenience. A
// byte-identical comparison was tried first and it missed `dogesir_` slice 3,
// the very case that prompted this: the source writes two spaces before `]}`
// and the archive writes one. The markup is the same markup and a copy that
// re-indented it is still a copy, so runs of whitespace are folded to one space
// on both sides before the blocks are compared. Nothing else is normalised, so
// two different components never collide.
//
// BLOCKS ARE READ OFF THE PARSE (ledger B68), not split on blank lines. A
// quoted transcript written on the line after its anchor, with no blank line
// between, joined the anchor in one block under a split; that block matched
// no source block, nothing was protected, and the lane could rewrite the
// transcript away from a source that never had it, the failure this module
// exists to prevent. A transcript is a block the parse reads as a
// blockquote, and the split cuts the ARCHIVE'S OWN BYTES at the anchor's end
// rather than rejoining trimmed blocks with a blank line, so restoring the
// protected run onto the judged part rebuilds the archive exactly.
