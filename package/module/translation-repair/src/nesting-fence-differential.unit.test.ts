/**
 Tests that the nesting scan never skips a stretch the parser would nest,
 against the parser itself, over a generated family of texts: a line that may
 open a fence, in a context that may or may not make it one, with the
 indentation it may carry, closed or not, followed by text the parser would
 nest if it reads it as text.

 THE RULE UNDER TEST. The scan may refuse a text the parser would read, and
 each such case is stated beside the family, but it never passes a text in
 which the parser nests past the bound. The oracle is the grammar's own parser
 run without the scan: for every text the scan passes, the depth of the tree
 it builds stays under a limit and both entries parse the text within a
 stated time.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
