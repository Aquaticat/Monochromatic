// The rule tying a lane's OUTCOME to the archive's own state at the same slice.
//
// `LaneSliceText` carries two independent axes on purpose, and independent is
// not unconstrained: three of their combinations describe a slice that cannot
// exist. `buildLaneSliceTexts` refuses all three while it is building, but it
// is not the only way a wording reaches a consumer. The type is exported, the
// delivery ledger and the lane comparison both take wordings from a caller, and
// an artifact reader will take them from disk. Each of those is a boundary
// where the producer's checks are somebody else's assumption.
//
// So the rule lives here rather than inside the builder, and every boundary
// asserts it for itself. The cost is one pass over the slices; what it buys is
// that no reader has to trust the writer.

 disagree about which slices exist; this means one wording disagrees with
 itself, which no join or count could detect afterwards because every field is
 individually well formed.
