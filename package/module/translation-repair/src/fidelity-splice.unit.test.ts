/**
 * Tests for the join rule that removes a sentence without leaving an edit-mark.
 *
 * REACHED ONLY THROUGH `fidelity-damage.ts`, whose own cases ask whether a
 * sentence disappeared. Every join rule answers that question identically,
 * including no join rule at all, so the whitespace decision this module exists
 * for is invisible to them.
 *
 * WHAT A DIAGNOSTIC MUTATION FOUND. Removing the line-break precedence from the
 * private `survivingRun`, leaving only the two boundary rules and the length
 * tiebreak, left the whole suite green. That branch decides whether a paragraph
 * cut from the middle of a page leaves a paragraph break behind or collapses two
 * paragraphs into one line, which is the visible edit-mark the module was
 * written to prevent. Both of its arms are pinned here.
 *
 * WHY THE TWO EXOTIC SPACES GET CASES. The corpus is Chinese, and Chinese prose
 * separates sentences with `\u3000`. A separator set that missed it would cut
 * the sentence and leave BOTH ideographic spaces behind, a doubled gap visible
 * only on the half of the corpus this pipeline exists for.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
