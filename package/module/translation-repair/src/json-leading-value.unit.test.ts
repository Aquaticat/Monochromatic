 Tests for the reader of the JSON value an answer opens with, read through
 `parseAnswerJson`, which asks it last: an answer with nothing in it has no
 opening value, and an opening container that balances but is not JSON is
 refused as the whole answer is.

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
