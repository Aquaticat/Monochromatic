/**
 * Guard that the verse rule reaches the requests `translateDocument` sends,
 * on both halves of a governed round, and reaches neither half of an
 * ungoverned one.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: until 2026-08-22 the rule reached the translators and
 * no judge at all. `judgeTranslateSlate` had no line-structure parameter, so
 * there was nothing to forward and nothing to notice missing. The damage was
 * not silence but contradiction: criterion four tells every judge that a shape
 * the ORIGINAL does not have is not a fault, and on a verse slice that is the
 * right rule pointed the wrong way, since there the ORIGINAL is what carries
 * the line structure and the archive page is what merged it. A translator
 * obeying the rule unmerges, and its judge had been handed a reason to prefer
 * the merged rival. Measured under `#162`: 211 slices across 34 entries of the
 * 92 pairs are governed.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO TEST THE HALVES. `translate-judge.unit.test.ts` and
 * `translate-stage.unit.test.ts` each carry a governed and an ungoverned round,
 * and both call their function with the flag written out by hand. Neither can
 * see whether a real document ever DERIVES that flag and passes it down. The
 * chain here is `translateDocument` to `attemptTranslateSlice` to
 * `settleTranslateSlice`, which reads `prepared.lineStructuredSliceIndices`, to
 * `runTranslateStage`, which hands both halves their copy. Any link dropping it
 * leaves every case in those files passing.
 *
 * WHAT IS PINNED, read off the recorded request rather than off the driver's
 * return value: a governed document's JUDGE sheets carry
 * `TRANSLATE_LINE_STRUCTURE_CRITERION`, its TRANSLATOR sheets carry
 * `TRANSLATE_LINE_STRUCTURE_RULE`, and an ungoverned document's sheets carry
 * neither. The translator half is the control that makes the judge half
 * legible: it is the wiring `#150` landed and this fixture's governance is
 * only a claim until something production decides agrees with it.
 *
 * READING THE RETURN VALUE WOULD PROVE NOTHING. `#107` built a judging window,
 * keyed it, and never passed it to the call it was keyed for; nothing failed
 * for weeks because every test read what the driver returned, which the missing
 * wiring never touched.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
