//region Unpartnered gap steps
// A GAP THE ROSTER LEFT UNPLACED ON BOTH SIDES IS ONE RENDERING. Between two
// paired steps a roster may leave originals and translation blocks alike
// unpartnered: it paired the blocks around a passage and nothing inside it,
// which happens when the translator merged and split the passage so that no
// block answers to one block. Read as bare steps, the originals become
// insertions (a coverage round then calls them carried or absent) and the
// translation blocks, undeclined because the pairing placed no original, ride
// into the next paired slice's span. On mikaela15 (2026-09-24) that shape
// shipped the HRT passage twice: the class one hundred eleven fold rendered
// the carried originals through their carrier and slice 13 kept the archive's
// rendering it had been handed (class one hundred twelve); on mikaela12 and 13
// the same shape lost the passage instead.
//
// THE FIRST PAIR OPENS THE RENDERING AND THE REST RIDE ALONG, which is the
// vocabulary a roster already uses for a merge: `paired` once, then
// `continuesPairing` on both sides. The grouper keeps continuations in one
// run, the anchor reader gives them no insertion, and the decline reader never
// declines them, so the gap reaches the lanes as one slice whose source is
// every unplaced original and whose span is every unplaced block.
//
// INTERIOR GAPS ONLY. A leading gap has no pairing before it and a trailing
// gap none after it; the tail bound (owner decision 2026-09-19) and the
// leading-skip rule already read those, and this pass leaves them as they
// are. A gap with blocks on one side alone is not a rendering and stays bare.
