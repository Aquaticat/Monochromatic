/**
 * Tests for the degeneration detector.
 *
 * The cases that matter are the two ways this can be wrong in production, and
 * they pull in opposite directions. Missing a cycling model leaves the failure
 * this exists to stop; calling healthy output degenerate aborts good work and
 * costs a voice, which is the exact harm the straggler-grace decision spent a
 * whole document avoiding.
 *
 * So the false-positive cases carry as much weight here as the detection ones,
 * and three of them are real rather than imagined. Stages ask for structured
 * replies, so repeated field names are ordinary output. Some models simply
 * write a great deal, so length must never condemn on its own. And this corpus
 * contains verse, so a refrain is content rather than a symptom.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
