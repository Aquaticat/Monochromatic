/**
 Tests that the editors and both editor selections are told that saying
 something twice is adding content, unless the ORIGINAL says it again at that
 place (ledger L14(b)).

 WHY. The audit found editors writing neighbouring text into a region and the
 chunk judges choosing it. Over every artifact, 56 of 6,222 chunk candidates
 carried a sentence more often than the slice's archive English did, the
 judges selected such a candidate 3 times, and Carena0442 slice 14 on a build
 of 2026-09-02 shipped two such sentences through a repair-lane win. The
 editor sheet forbade copying the NEARBY blocks but said nothing about the
 translation outside a region, and the selections' faithfulness test named
 added content without saying a repeat is some.

 CONDITIONED ON THE ORIGINAL, because the editor sheet also says to translate
 ALL of an omission: a refrain the archive rendered once is an omission, and a
 rule against repetition as such would forbid filling it.

 The editor sheet shows the whole TRANSLATION and the whole ORIGINAL, so the
 rule asks for nothing the editor cannot check (rendered 2026-09-28).

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention.
