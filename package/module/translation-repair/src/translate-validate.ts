//region Translate validation
// Compares a candidate translation against its ORIGINAL on everything that
// survives translation: the block skeleton, and the references and code inside
// it.
//
// This exists because the deterministic apply gate cannot serve here. Every
// policy in that gate is anchored to an EDIT bounded by an envelope some
// accepted issue named, and a whole-slice replacement has no envelope. Faking
// one that spans the slice fails in both directions: with no licensed quotes
// the preservation rule rejects nearly every legitimate translation, and
// licensing the whole envelope makes it vacuous.
//
// FINDINGS ARE WRITTEN FOR THE MODEL THAT WROTE THE CANDIDATE, not for a log.
// By user decision of 2026-08-15 an invalid candidate is not dropped: it goes
// back to its own author with these sentences, and that model answers with a
// revision, an inability, or a defence of what it produced. So each finding
// names what the original has, what the candidate has, and nothing else.

 the slice half alone covers 55 slices where the union covers 211
 
 @param declared - name pairs the front matter declares, so a linked title
 naming a declared person is held to the declared form (class one hundred
