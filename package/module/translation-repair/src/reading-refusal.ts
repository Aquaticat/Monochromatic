//region Reading refusal
// WHETHER A MODEL DECLINED TO READ A PICTURE, rather than read it.
//
// WHY THIS IS ITS OWN SCREEN AND NOT A LONGER PHRASE LIST. A fixed list of
// wordings refuses only what somebody thought to write down, and real traffic on
// 2026-08-19 showed how narrow that is. Two readers were sent the same picture
// and answered:
//
//     Qwen3.6-27B    "There is no text visible in this image."
//     Kimi-K3        "No legible text is visible."
//
// The list carried `no text is visible` and `no visible text`. The first reply
// misses by word order, the second by the word `legible` sitting between `no`
// and `text`. Both passed the screen, and then CORROBORATED EACH OTHER at 0.565
// trigram overlap, because two ways of saying "there is nothing here" share
// their vocabulary exactly as two transcriptions of one passage do.
//
// THAT IS THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS TO STOP. A corroborated refusal is worse than
// no reading, because a refused picture is silent while a corroborated one
// travels to the translator and the judge under the heading "WHAT THE PICTURES
// HERE SAY, transcribed by two readers that agreed". The sheets would then
// assert that a picture says `There is no text visible in this image.`
//
// SHAPE RATHER THAN WORDING. A refusal talks ABOUT the picture: it negates, it
// names the picture or its text, and it is a sentence rather than a passage. A
// transcription reproduces what the picture holds and does none of those. So the
// test is a negation word plus a picture word inside a short reading, which no
// wording of "there is nothing to read" escapes and no transcription of a
// Chinese passage trips.
//
// MEASURED ON WHAT WAS AVAILABLE, both directions. The six real transcriptions
// kept from the 2026-08-19 boundary probe run 976 to 1520 bytes and contain ZERO
// English negation words and ZERO picture words between them, so the rule cannot
// reach them on either test. The two refusals above carry both, at 27 and 41
// characters. The separation is not marginal on this sample, and the length
// bound is a second margin rather than the main one: an English transcription
// long enough to discuss text and negate something is past it before either word
// list is consulted.
