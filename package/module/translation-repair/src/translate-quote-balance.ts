//region Closing quotation marks with no opening one
// CLASS ONE HUNDRED SIXTY-FIVE (TianqiChen6665, 2026-09-26). The original's
// final message quotes each of its three lines with 「」, and the archive's
// rendering closed the last line with ” and opened none; the page shipped it
// on an unendorsed standing. A quotation mark that closes nothing is a
// broken sentence on the page whatever the judges read, so a candidate
// carrying one is refused before any judge reads it, which also makes such
// an archive rendering an ineligible standing. THE FLOOR STANDS ASIDE where
// the original itself closes a quotation it never opened (a slice boundary
// inside a quotation), since the rendering then owes the same shape. An
// opening mark with no closing one is no fault: a quotation over several
// paragraphs opens each and closes only the last. Single marks are left
// alone, since an apostrophe is a single closing mark.
//
// CLASS ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY-FIVE (TianqiChen66610 slice 16, 2026-09-26): the
// same stray closer shipped as a straight double quote ("rely on.""), which
// this floor left alone and the typography restore left straight on its odd
// count. A straight double quote is read by its shape: one between a word or
// punctuation and a space or line end closes, one between a space or line
// start and a word opens, one after a digit is an inch mark and reads as
// neither, and any other shape is left unread.
