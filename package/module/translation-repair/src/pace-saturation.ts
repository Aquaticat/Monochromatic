// request starts in a rolling hour were spent in the pass's first 33
// minutes; its pacer then made the next call wait 1,640,012 ms, and the
// router kept sending Hyper the models OpenRouter serves too, because a wet
// meter was all it read. A request window that would make the call wait is
// the provider's capacity in use, the same state as a per-model slot limit
// taken: the call overflows to a usable provider behind it, and queues on the
// paced provider only when nobody usable stands behind. No wait is too short
