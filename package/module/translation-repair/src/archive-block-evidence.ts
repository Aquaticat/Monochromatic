 Deterministically corroborates narrow translation-side apparatus category.

 EVERY LINE A READER SEES IS APPARATUS (ledger B81). With the block's
 comments blanked, each line it shows is one the contributor reader takes
 as a declaration, one opening with an apparatus label, or one of pictures
 alone; a block of closed comments and nothing else is apparatus too, and
 a comment left open is not. The check once accepted a block when any line
 declared contributors, or when it opened with a label, a picture or a
 comment and ended with a closed one, so prose beside them passed with
 them, and a label's words opening a longer word passed as the label.

 What a label line says after its label is not read: whether it names a
 person or tells of one is the reviewers' to judge.
