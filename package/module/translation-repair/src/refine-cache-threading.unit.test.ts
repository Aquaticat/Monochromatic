/**
 * Tests that the refinement step HANDS ITS CACHE DOWN to the phase that fills
 * it.
 *
 * WHY THE CACHE IS LOAD-BEARING. The naturalness lane buys a rewriter round, a
 * ballot and a defect check per refinable slice. `#171` records what happens
 * without a cache: a resumed run republishes nothing and rebuys all of it, and
 * `#174` made every cached stage republish its findings rather than go quiet.
 * The cache is how a run that was interrupted costs what it already paid.
 *
 * WHAT WAS MEASURED. On 2026-08-25, inverting this step's conditional spread so
 * the cache is forwarded only when it is ABSENT failed no test in this package.
 * The lane would then settle correctly, log correctly, and persist nothing, so
 * the defect shows up only on the next run and only as a bill.
 *
 * READ OFF THE CACHE, not off the settlement. A step that forwarded nothing
 * still returns the right text; what it stops doing is writing.
 *
 * THE SECOND CASE IS THE ABSENT ONE, since a step that manufactured a cache of
 * its own would satisfy the first on its own. A lane given none must still
 * settle rather than refuse.
 *
 * NO NETWORK. Each stage is scripted by the schema it asks for, and the cache
 * records the keys it was asked to persist rather than writing any file.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
