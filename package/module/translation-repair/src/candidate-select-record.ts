//region Candidate selection recording
// THE PUBLIC SELECTION ENTRY POINT, which is the deciding call plus the record
// of what it decided over.
//
// A WRAPPER RATHER THAN A HOOK INSIDE THE CASCADE. `decideBestCandidate` leaves
// by six different returns, five of them declines, and threading a write
// through each one would mean five chances to forget the sixth. Wrapping the
// whole call records every path by construction, and leaves the decision logic
// untouched.
//
// A SEPARATE MODULE because `candidate-select.ts` sits at 269 of its 300
// permitted code lines, and the request type restated here would breach it.
// `Parameters<typeof ...>` borrows the signature instead of copying it, so the
// two cannot drift.

/**
 * Chooses among candidates and records the contest that decided it.
 *
 * Identical in behaviour to {@link decideBestCandidate}; every caller in this
 * package should reach for this one, so that no judged contest goes unrecorded.
 *
 * THE RECORD IS AWAITED, not fired and forgotten. A contest whose write is
 * still in flight when the process exits is a contest missing from the ledger,
 * and the whole point is that a later reader finds the evidence. The cost is one
 * small file write against a round that just spent several model calls.
 *
 * @param request - exactly what {@link decideBestCandidate} takes
 *
 * @returns Whatever it decided, unchanged
 *
 * @throws {@link import('./repair-contract.ts').ProducerRosterError} when a judge
 * appears twice on the roster
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const outcome = await selectBestCandidate({ client, candidates, judgeModelIds, ... },);
