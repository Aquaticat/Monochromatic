/**
 Guards ledger S13 and H6: the absolute naturalness review reads the house
 rules, and on prose it reads each paragraph as it renders.

 Its findings are required corrections, yet the sheet carried no house rule:
 it told reviewers to preserve "deliberate source-language kinship terms",
 against the house rule translating a term with an everyday English
 equivalent, and a reviewer measuring against no reader-protection rule could
 file a protected vagueness as a defect to fix. It was also shown the polish
 wrapped at its semantic boundaries, the layout the polish gate stopped
 showing its judges after they weighed line breaks (classes one hundred
 fifty-two and fifty-three).

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention.
