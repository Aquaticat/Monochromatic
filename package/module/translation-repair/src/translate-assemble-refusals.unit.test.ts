/**
 * Tests for what a settled translate document says about slices a GUARD
 * refused, which is three different guards wearing one count.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `assembleTranslation` reports `refusedSliceCount` as
 * the size of a filter naming three dispositions, and `alignmentRefusals`
 * writes one finding per refusal in three shapes. Every case reaching either of
 * them before this drove ONE of the three, `refused-alignment`, so dropping
 * either of the other two from the filter would have cost the artifact a
 * refusal and failed nothing. The two other kinds were pinned at the slice that
 * produces them and nowhere downstream.
 *
 * A FOURTH SLICE IS SETTLED NORMALLY so the count cannot pass by counting every
 * slice, and so the finding list cannot pass by naming every slice.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
