// path is: voices come back in whatever order the provider answered, so arrival
// order would make the anonymized candidate numbering and the duplicate-collapse
// winner vary between runs over identical inputs.
//
// The incumbent is assembled FIRST, matching where `repairChunk` puts the
// unchanged text in its own two-candidate selection. That is assembly order
// rather than ballot order: `runTranslateStage` rotates the slate by a hash of
// the slice before judges see it, so the incumbent does not sit in the same
// position on every slice and its win rate is not also a measure of whatever
// position preference the judges have.

 Assembles the candidate slate for one slice.

 (ledger B24), and on a slice the line-structure rule does not govern, where a
 paragraph's soft line breaks fall (ledger B26). A model whose rendering is
 the incumbent's in all but those is reported as matching it.

 @param voices - heard translator replies in arrival order, each folded where
 its lane first held it (`foldTranslatorVoices`), so every check before this
 read the bytes that ship

 @param translatorModelIds - roster, fixing candidate order

 @param incumbentText - translation as it stands, blank when this slice has
 none

 @param lineStructured - whether the line-structure rule governs the slice,
 which keeps two renderings whose lines differ apart

 @param laneTexts - what the repair and translate lanes would ship, offered
 to a consolidation slate whose standing is neither contest-endorsed nor
 eligible (class forty, 2026-09-17); none on a translate slate
