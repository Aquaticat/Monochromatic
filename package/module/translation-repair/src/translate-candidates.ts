// path is: voices come back in whatever order the provider answered, so arrival
// order would make the anonymized candidate numbering and the duplicate-collapse
// winner vary between runs over identical inputs.
//
// The incumbent is assembled FIRST, matching where `repairChunk` puts the
// unchanged text in its own two-candidate selection. That is assembly order
// rather than ballot order: `runTranslateStage` rotates the slate by a hash of
// the slice before judges see it, so the incumbent does not sit in the same
// position on every slice and its win rate is not also a measure of whatever
// position preference the judges have.
