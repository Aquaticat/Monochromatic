// MEASURED ON SHI_YUMIAOYA4 (2026-09-17): the coverage round for the death
// paragraphs heard one partial claim quoting the archive's farewell line,
// "girl's last tour ended", which the pairing had assigned to the original's
// own farewell slice. The quote anchored, the claim counted as partial
// coverage, the round split, and the passage shipped as a recorded gap on a
// SETTLED memorial page. English the pairing assigned to another source slice
// renders THAT original; a partial claim pointing at it says nothing about the
// passage asked about, so it is dropped: neither coverage nor a vote for
// absence. A FULL claim inside such a region is kept, since an archive that
// merged two originals into one paragraph carries the second inside the
// first's region, and that is exactly what a full claim there reports.
