/**
 Tests for the reviewed calibration request check, which refuses an unreviewed
 request before any corpus or provider work, metadata-only preflight included.

 Every refusal case names the boundary that fired and the identifier the
 message names, and asserts the whole message, so a refusal raised by another
 check fails the case that expects this one. Fixtures are cat-themed
 invention; the default-manifest cases read the checked-in manifest's
 metadata only, never a corpus.
