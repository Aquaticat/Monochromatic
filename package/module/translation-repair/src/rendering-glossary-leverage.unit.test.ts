/**
 Guards class one hundred fifty-seven (aiyysk1, 2026-09-26): under the
 owner's standing instruction of 2026-09-25 ("whenever you see anything that
 can be translated better do it"), 以生命相逼 joins the rendering glossary. The
 friend who pressed with her own life, threatening to kill herself if the
 other self-harmed, shipped as "threatened her life", which tells an English
 reader she threatened the other's life. The glossary seeds English that
 names whose life is staked and refuses the reversal.

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
