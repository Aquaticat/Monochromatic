/**
 Findings for JSON escapes that leaked into a candidate as text.
 
 WHY. A model answering in JSON sometimes escapes the quotation marks inside
 its string twice, and the decoded text then carries a literal backslash
 before each mark. The Carena0442 page published on 2026-09-02 shipped
 `so-called \"common sense.\"` that way: the consolidation producer's text
 carried it, every structural guard passed it, and the polish kept it. The
 pinned corpus carries no such sequence in any page, so a candidate carrying
 one where neither the original nor the page does is a leak, not a rendering.
 
 @param sourceText - original slice
 
 @param pageText - page slice the candidate would replace
 
 @param candidateText - candidate under validation
 
 @returns One finding when the candidate alone carries the sequence
 
 @example
 ```ts
 leakedEscapeFindings({ sourceText: '“常识”', pageText: '“common sense”', candidateText: '\\"common sense\\"', },);
 ```
