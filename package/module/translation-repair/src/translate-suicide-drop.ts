//region A suicide the passage names
// CLASS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY (shi_Yumiaoya36, 2026-09-26). The original states a
// suicide attempt she survived (six days in intensive care, then she woke),
// and the page shipped a sentence naming only the means: the attempt the
// original states was gone, and the means the house rule keeps vague stood in
// its place. The polish round chose a rendering that said the attempt 2.5 to 2
// with two ballots citing the survived-attempt rule, and the polish gate
// settled on neither, so the base shipped. (The original's sentence and both
// renderings named the means; they are left out here under the same house
// rule, ledger X3.) The house rule says a survived attempt is
// still an attempt and the page says she attempted suicide or tried to end her
// life; a rendering with no wording for suicide at all has dropped what the
// ORIGINAL states and is refused before any judge reads it, as a dropped
// address is (class ninety-seven). THE FLOOR IS NARROW: it asks only that the
// suicide be said, never how, so a vague rendering the house rule prefers
// passes, and whether the means are too specific stays with the judges. The
// corpus census of 2026-09-26 found 44 entries whose original names a suicide;
// the archive English of 40 says it, two (shi_Yumiaoya, XIEPT2) are partial
// archives without those passages, and two render a quoted line without the
// word (自杀痛苦 as "the pain of dying", 别自杀 as "please don't follow her"),
// which the floor now refuses as a standing.
//
// LEDGER F-4 (2026-09-27). That census counted entries, not slices. Replayed
// slice by slice over 1,264 archive slices and 3,975 would-ship slices, the
// floor refused 11, and three of those were correct English: an attempt on a
// life said as "attempts on her own life", and one quotation of a published
// work given in its published English, whose Chinese translation had added
// 自杀. An attempt on a life, a death by one's own hand (after a death word,
// so a hand that only wrote does not count) and an attributed quotation of a
// work (quoted block closing on a dash and a title in 《》) now pass; the
// other eight refusals, each dropping or blurring the word, stand, and none
// was added. The finding no longer assumes the person is "she".
