// THE ANSWER TOOL, described twice on purpose.
//
// Charm Hyper speaks the Anthropic Messages protocol, which carries no
// `response_format`. Structured output there is obtained by defining a tool
// whose input schema IS the answer schema and requiring the model to call it.
// The OpenAI-compatible half of this pipeline states the same constraint as
// `JsonSchemaResponseFormat`, so this file translates one into the other and
// nothing downstream learns which provider answered.
//
// WHY THE SCHEMA IS WRITTEN INTO THE SYSTEM PROMPT AS WELL, at the owner's
// instruction: some model and provider pairs behave badly without a detailed
// system prompt, up to and including emitting the wrong tool-call format. The
// schema in `tools` is what the server validates against; the schema in
// `system` is what the model READS. A weak model follows the prose and ignores
// the envelope, so both carry it, and both are rendered from the same argument
// here so they cannot drift apart.
//
// THE FORMAT RULES ARE NOT FILLER. Each line of them names a shape a model has
// actually been seen to emit instead of a tool call: the answer as fenced text,
// the arguments as a JSON string rather than an object, the object wrapped in
// one more envelope key, renamed properties, a required field dropped because
// its honest value was empty, a second call carrying the rest.
