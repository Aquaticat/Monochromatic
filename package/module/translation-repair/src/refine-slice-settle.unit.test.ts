/**
 Tests that the naturalness lane's slice settler does not stop on the critics'
 non-translation votes (ledger L15), and that a rewrite ships only past a
 recheck its checkers were heard on and a damage probe its probers were heard
 on (ledger L11).

 WHY THIS FILE WAS WRONG. It was written on 2026-08-24 to defend an early
 return that deleting left the whole suite green, on the reading that a slice
 the critics ruled non-translation "shipped deliberately untouched". That had
 stopped being true on 2026-08-16: question 3, answer B
 (`doc/decision/translation-repair-question-answers.md`) keeps critics as
 evidence "rather than deciding anything", removes every early return they
 owned, and `05ff9791e` stopped `repairChunk` returning its input unchanged
 when the votes stand. This early return was the one left: over every
 artifact, 10 of 6,150 slices had standing votes, the repair lane changed 8
 of them, and none of the 9 in runs that refine was refined.

 SO BOTH CASES REACH THE CLIENT. A client that throws on any exchange makes
 reaching a model observable; a slice standing as non-translation must reach
 it exactly as the same slice without the ruling does.

 THE SCRIPTED CASES RUN THE WHOLE FLOW against a client that answers each
 stage by the name of its structured-output constraint, with a reply that
 stage's own wire guard accepts, and each asserts the settlement's findings
 whole, so a stage the script failed to answer shows as a lost voice in the
 case that ran it. The recheck gate's own verdicts, round by round, are in
 `refine-recheck.unit.test.ts`.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.

 empty report, which the checker stage's guard refuses (ledger L8), so the
