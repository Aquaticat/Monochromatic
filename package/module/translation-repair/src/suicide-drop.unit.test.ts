/**
 Guards class one hundred fifty (2026-09-26): an original that names a
 suicide (自杀, 自尽, 轻生) shipped in wording that dropped the attempt the
 original states and put in its place a detail the house rule keeps vague.
 A survived attempt is still an attempt: the page says she
 attempted suicide or tried to end her life, and a candidate carrying no
 wording for suicide at all is refused before any judge reads it. The floor
 asks only that the suicide be said; how vaguely the means are put stays with
 the judges. Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
