/**
 Tests that one translator's reply nested too deeply to read costs the stage
 that voice and nothing else.

 THE SHAPE UNDER TEST. A model reply is text from one voice. Before the nesting
 bound, a reply of thousands of nested quotation markers overflowed the stack
 inside a parser the repair turn reads the candidate through, and the
 `RangeError` that came out ended the whole translate stage, so the voices that
 wrote ordinary renderings lost their work with it. Each case here has one voice
 write such a reply and two write ordinary ones.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
