// What a settled record MEANS when the producing stage heard no translator, and
// the one place that says so.
//
// The driver keeps the archive's wording for such a slice and deliberately does
// not cache it, and `translateLaneWordings` reports it as the incumbent
// standing by default rather than as a decision. Both of those rest on a
// property nothing checked: that the record's own text really is the
// incumbent's, and that it does not claim to have changed anything.
//
// A stage that heard nobody and returned a change is a defect in the stage, and
// it would travel: the lane's shipped index set is built from `changed`, so the
// document would carry a replacement while the wording ledger reported that
// nobody produced one. That is the two-axis contradiction the ledger exists to
// make impossible, arriving from the other side.
