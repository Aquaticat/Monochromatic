/**
 Tests for the footnote floor on an archive block's revision (class
 eighty-four), read directly rather than through the review stage.

 LEDGER T8, EIGHTEENTH BATCH: a block the archive does not carry verbatim
 passed every revision without reading the page it would leave, a branch
 documented as kept for fixtures a caller composed. Production hands the
 floor an exact slice of the archive (`corpus-run/archive-block-repair.ts`),
 so such a block breaks the caller's contract, and the floor now refuses it
 rather than letting a revision past unread.

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
