// WHAT COUNTS AS A SUCCESSFUL REPLY, in one place rather than in each client.
//
// Both providers answer over plain HTTP and both clients ask the same question
// of the status before they try to read a body. The check lived inside the
// first client, so the second would have had to restate the two boundary
// numbers, and a pair of magic numbers restated in two files is a pair that
// can disagree.

/**
 * Whether a status says the body is worth reading as an answer.
 *
 * A REDIRECT IS NOT A SUCCESS HERE. Neither provider redirects an API call,
 * and a 3xx body carries no completion, so admitting one would send an empty
 * or HTML body into a parser that reports it as a provider contract violation
 * rather than as the misrouted request it is.
 *
 * @param status - HTTP status the transport reported
 *
 * @returns Whether the reply carries an answer rather than a failure
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * if (!isSuccessStatus({ status: reply.status, },)) throw new SyntheticHttpError({ status, bodyText, },);
