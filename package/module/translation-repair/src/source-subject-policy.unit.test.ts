/**
 Guards class one hundred eighty-three (TianqiChen66614, 2026-09-27): a quote
 whose clause the ORIGINAL gives to 我 shipped with the clause handed to
 "they" ("when I leave you all, they will end with the memories of
 kigurumi"), memories ending with memories, because the English already on
 the page had moved the subject the same way and the bench kept it. The first
 fix keyed a rendering-glossary entry on the sentence's own words; the owner
 pointed out that a sentence fragment is not a dictionary term, so the entry
 is gone and the house policy states the general rule: a clause keeps the
 subject the ORIGINAL writes.

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
