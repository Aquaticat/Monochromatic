 Gates the consolidation the judges chose, wraps what ships, and polishes it.
 
 @param client - provider client the gate borrows
 
 @param judgeModelIds - voices seated for the gate
 
 @param subject - slice in the archive's terms
 
 @param decided - what the slate judges settled, a fresh consolidation
 
 @param standingText - wording the consolidation has to beat
 
 @param lineStructured - whether structural rule forbids merged lines
 
 @param floor - what the validity floor made of the slate
 
 @param verdicts - every voice's verdict without its text
 
 @param sliceIndex - prepared position used by records and refusals
 
 @param polishConfig - final body polish roles and document guard facts
 
 @param standingMayShip - whether unchanged baseline has prior endorsement
 
 @param standingEligible - whether the standing passed the deterministic
 gate; over an ineligible standing every gate verdict ships the proposal
 the slate chose, a preference for the standing or a neither verdict
 recorded as a finding (classes fifty-four and one hundred eighty-five)

 @param standingRefusal - why the deterministic gate refused the standing,
 shown to the gate judges so keeping it is not taken for the safe choice
 
 @param standingFlawedByAll - whether every contest ballot called the
 standing flawed, so an undecided gate ships the slate's choice over it
 (class one hundred seventy-seven)

 @param identity - front matter identity as the gate takes it
 
 @param signal - cancellation for the whole settlement
 
 @param perCallTimeoutMs - bound on any single exchange
 
 @param l - stage logger
 
 @returns What ships, and every round that decided it; a gate keeping a
 standing the deterministic rule refused leaves the archive kept (owner,
 2026-09-27, "Keep archive, ship")
