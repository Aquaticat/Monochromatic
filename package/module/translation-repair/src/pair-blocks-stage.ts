// ASKS THE ROSTER WHICH PARAGRAPH RENDERS WHICH, and keeps only what enough of
// them agree on.
//
// NO SINGLE MODEL DECIDES, which is this package's rule everywhere a model is
// asked anything, and it matters more here than usual: a pairing is the input
// every later stage reasons from, so one model's mistake is not one bad claim
// but a document's worth of claims about passages that were never about the
// same thing.
//
// AGREEMENT IS PER PAIR rather than per reply. Two models can agree on nine
// correspondences and differ on the tenth, and discarding both replies over the
// tenth throws away the nine. Each `source,target` pair is counted on its own
// and kept when enough voices named it.

/**
 One section's settled pairing as the cache stores it.
 
 THE FINDINGS ARE HALF THE RECORD, not decoration beside the pairs. A resumed
 run makes no calls for a cached section, so anything the section reported the
 first time is reported by nothing on the second unless it was stored. Before
 this type the cache held a bare `BlockPair[]`, and a resumed entry lost the
 per-section pairing counts, the fallback notice, and every voice-level
 finding the round produced.
 
 ROSTER REACHABILITY IS STORED ON PURPOSE, including `block-pairing unusable`
 naming a voice that failed. It reads as a claim about a call this run never
 made, and it is kept anyway: the findings say what buying this pairing cost,
 and a resume that dropped them would report a healthier roster than the one
 that produced the stored pairs. `RefinedSliceSettlement` stores its
 `refine-candidates (N/M heard)` line for the same reason.
 
 `usable` and `heard` ARE DELIBERATELY ABSENT. They decide whether this round
 may be cached at all, which is a question about the run that asked rather
 than about these blocks, and the finding wording already carries both counts
 for any reader that wants them.
 
 @example
 ```ts
 const settled: PairedSectionRecord = { pairs: [], findings: [], };
 ```

/**
 Asks the roster to pair two block lists and keeps what enough voices agree on.
 
 REFUSES RATHER THAN GUESSES. When no voice answers usably the outcome carries
 no pairs and says why, and the caller falls back to the deterministic aligner
 rather than proceeding on one model's word. `#71` recorded the rule this
 follows: a wrong pairing is worse than no pairing, because it manufactures
 issues rather than skipping work.
