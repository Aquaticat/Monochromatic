// MODELS THE OWNER BLOCKLISTED ON 2026-09-01, verbatim authority in
// `doc/decision/translation-repair-roster-blocklist.md`. The candidate set for
// any calibration is the live provider catalogs minus this list, so the list
// is code rather than prose: the catalog drift check labels a blocked model
// BLOCKED instead of suggesting it, and a guard test refuses a compiled
// catalog that seats one.
//
// EXACT IDS FIRST, FAMILY PREDICATES SECOND. The exact ids are the owner's
// entries mapped to every spelling the two providers serve today, aliases
// included, because an alias left unmapped resurfaces the blocked model under
// its other name at the next refresh. The predicates cover only the entries
// the owner phrased as a series or family (Llama, Qwen3.6, Qwen3.7, bare
// Qwen3), so a name the providers add later inside one of those families is
// caught without an edit; entries the owner phrased as single models (Kimi
// K2.5 through K2.7 Code, GLM5, GLM5.1) stay exact, because extending them
// would convert agent inference into owner instruction.
