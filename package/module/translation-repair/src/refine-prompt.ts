//region Refinement prompt
// The sheet one rewriter sees for one slice.
//
// This prompt carries more weight than the editor's. The editor works from
// issues a panel already accepted, and checkers afterwards prove each one gone.
// Refinement has no accepted issue behind it and, on a slice with no accepted
// issues at all, nothing downstream re-examines the meaning either. The
// instruction to leave a paragraph alone is therefore the main thing standing
// between an unnecessary rewrite and shipped text, and it is written to be
// easier to obey than to ignore.

// Fences are chosen against the content they enclose rather than fixed, the
// same way `candidate-select-wire.ts` and the introduced-defect probe choose
// theirs. A fixed fence is forgeable: enclosed text carrying a line of the
// fence character closes its own block early, so the rest of that paragraph
// reads to the model as instructions rather than as content. The old fixed
// value was `=====`, which is ordinary Markdown (a setext heading underline),
// so this is a shape real documents contain rather than an invented one.

 WRITTEN AGAINST "any word left in the original language" (ledger S10). The
 sheet once told the rewriter to keep every such word, every date and every
 handle unchanged, beside house rules rendering Han, Ta, titles, handles,
 shorthand and day-first dates. Precedence in the house block settles the
 disagreement; this clause removes it, so the sheet says what the house rules
 say.

 @example
 ```ts
 const rule = `Every date survives, ${SURVIVAL_FORM}.`;
 ```

Preserve meaning, not Chinese grammar. Do not retain source-language word order or parts of speech when idiomatic English expresses the same meaning differently. Look for calqued verb-object combinations, stacked time or aspect adverbs, repeated generic nouns or pronouns, stiff causal transitions, and literal emotional descriptions. When you rewrite a paragraph, fix every clear naturalness problem in it rather than only the easiest phrase, then reread the whole replacement for anything a careful native editor would still change.
