//region Anthropic delta scan
// The SAME `DeltaScanner` the OpenAI-shaped path produces, fed by Anthropic
// Messages events instead.
//
// WHY NORMALIZE RATHER THAN GUARD TWICE. Everything downstream of a scanner
// consumes `ChannelDelta` and nothing else: `stream-degeneration.ts` counts
// repetition per channel, `stream-idle-guard.ts` watches the gap between
// deltas, `stream-runaway-watch.ts` decides when a call has stopped making
// progress, and `stream-overrun.ts` bounds volume. Every threshold in that set
// came from measurement, and the straggler and idle windows were re-derived
// after finding the median premise wrong by a factor of eighty. A second
// implementation of those guards would be unmeasured, and would drift from
// this one invisibly. One scanner interface, two wire formats.
//
// THE THINKING CHANNEL IS TYPED HERE RATHER THAN SNIFFED. Sniffing once cost 47
// percent of calls to a scanner that had to guess which of two field spellings
// carried reasoning, because the OpenAI-shaped provider names it
// `reasoning_content` on some models and `reasoning` on others. Anthropic
// sends a `thinking` content block with `thinking_delta` events, so the
// channel is declared by the wire and that whole class of blindness cannot
// recur through this path.
//
// `event:` LINES ARE IGNORED ON PURPOSE. Every Anthropic frame carries its own
// `type` inside the JSON payload, so reading the payload is both sufficient and
// robust against a server that reorders or omits the `event:` line.

 channel under different fields; a table of pairs holds them. Split, a type
 with a channel and no field was possible, and a thinking block lent its
 channel to every type, so a type this scanner does not read was filed as
 reasoning and its text read from the field named by the empty string.
 
 A MAP, since the key is the type the provider's stream names: a plain object
 answered a delta typed `constructor` or `__proto__` with what every object
 inherits, and filed its text under that as a channel (ledger B77).

/**
 Delta types carrying the answer itself, which no enclosing block may demote
 to reasoning.
 
 THE ASYMMETRY IS THE POINT, and `text_delta` is deliberately NOT here. A
 provider has been seen sending plain text deltas inside a thinking block, so
 a `text_delta` must still yield to whatever the block declared. A tool-call
 argument fragment cannot be deliberation: it is the structured answer by
 construction, filling a schema this pipeline sent.
 
 CAPTURED FROM THE WIRE on 2026-08-25. `qwen3.8-max` on Charm Hyper
 opens index 1 as `tool_use`, then opens THE SAME INDEX again as `thinking`,
 and thereafter interleaves `thinking_delta` and `input_json_delta` under it.
 The block map keeps the later declaration, so the block-type override filed
 the whole reply as reasoning: 70 of 71 streams reported zero content while
 every one of them cast a ballot with a full prose reason.
 
 NOT COSMETIC. `stream-runaway-watch.ts` bounds the content channel and
 deliberately leaves reasoning alone, so an answer filed as reasoning escapes
 the volume cap and runs to the straggler deadline. That seat was cut 12 times
 in 71, the highest on the roster by two and a half times, and each cut is a
 lost voice on a panel already paid for.
 
 WHY THIS RATHER THAN FIXING THE BLOCK MAP: keeping the FIRST declaration
 would also route this capture correctly, but only because `tool_use` happened
 to arrive first. This holds whichever order the two declarations come in.
