/**
 * Tests for locating a claimed defect in a document.
 *
 * WHAT THESE PIN is the split that the first version of this instrument did not
 * have: a LOCATOR says which occurrence is meant, a FOCUS says what changed,
 * and the second is allowed to be short and repeated as long as it is unique
 * inside the first. The cases below are the ones that decide whether that split
 * actually buys anything, so each names the reading it would have had under a
 * single-span rule.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
