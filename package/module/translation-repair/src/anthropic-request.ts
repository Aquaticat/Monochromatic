//region Anthropic request
// THE BODY ONE CALL SENDS, assembled from what the pipeline already builds.
//
// Three differences from the OpenAI-compatible request, and they are the whole
// of this file:
//
//   The system prompt is a TOP-LEVEL FIELD, not a message. Every wire in this
//   pipeline opens its message array with a system message, so those are lifted
//   out here rather than rewritten upstream.
//
//   `max_tokens` is REQUIRED. The OpenAI side leaves it off by default, on the
//   measured grounds that thinking tokens count against it and a tight cap
//   truncates mid-thinking. There is no leaving it off here, so it defaults to
//   the per-model ceiling the owner decided on: the lower of `#156`'s measured
//   answer bound and the model's own cap.
//
//   Structured output is a TOOL rather than a `response_format`, which
//   `anthropic-tool.ts` carries.
//
// STREAMING IS NOT A PARAMETER. The owner's instruction is that streaming is
// always on, and every stream guard `#118` through `#158` reads a live stream,
// so a non-streaming body would be a call none of them cover.
