//region Anthropic completion
// Reassembles one drained Anthropic Messages stream into the same
// `ExtractedCompletion` the OpenAI-shaped path produces, so `model-content.ts`
// reads an answer without knowing which provider served it.
//
// THE ANSWER IS USUALLY A TOOL CALL HERE. Charm Hyper produces schema-valid
// output only under tool use, so on most calls the model emits no text at all
// and the whole reply arrives as `input_json_delta` fragments of the tool's
// arguments. Those fragments ARE the answer, and concatenating them yields the
// JSON a validator then reads.
//
// THE BODY IS CHECKED WHOLE FIRST, by `requireWholeAnthropicMessage` in
// `anthropic-whole-message.ts`, which the retry ladder asks too: a terminator
// frame, and no error event.
//
// `[DONE]` IS SKIPPED, NOT REFUSED. OpenRouter's Messages endpoint appends an
// `event: data` frame carrying the OpenAI-style `data: [DONE]` sentinel after
// `message_stop` (captured 2026-09-03, `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-0731` via
// DigitalOcean), and Charm Hyper sends no such frame. The sentinel is not an
// event and carries nothing, so it is the one non-JSON payload this reader
// lets through; every other unreadable payload still refuses the body.
//
// THINKING IS DISCARDED HERE ON PURPOSE. `thinking_delta` is the model's
// private channel; `anthropic-delta-scan.ts` routes it to the guards that watch
// for a runaway, and this file reads only the answer.

/**
 Sentinel some gateways append after the terminator, carrying no event.

 constant is private to the OpenAI-shaped reader, and the two readers are
 kept independent so a change to one wire format cannot reach the other.
