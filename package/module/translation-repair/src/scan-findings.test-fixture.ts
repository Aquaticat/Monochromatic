// a few dozen characters down to its length (`expected [ …(31) ] to deeply
// equal []`), so a reader of a failing scan had to run the scan's walk again
// in a probe to learn what it found. The cut is the default of chai, which
// `module-test` neither raises nor exports (issue 610), so each helper here
// writes the difference itself, every line whole, and then makes the
// comparison the scan made, so a scan passes and fails on the inputs it did.
