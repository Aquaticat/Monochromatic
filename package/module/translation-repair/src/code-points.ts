// One counter, shared by everything that compares a Chinese size against an
// English one, and the two readers that take the whole code point at or before
// an offset, shared by every scan that tests a character whose class reaches
// past the first plane.
//
// EXTRACTED RATHER THAN COPIED. The refusal guard in `translate-alignment.ts`
// and the corroboration gate in `coverage-corroboration.ts` both divide one of
// these counts by another, and a copy that drifted would let the two disagree
// about the same page while both looked right. The readers lived in
// `quote-neighbours.ts` (class ninety-six) with a private copy of the forward
// one in `mdx-tag-start.ts`, until the scans of ledger B21 needed them too.

/**
 Counts code points rather than UTF-16 units.

 `length` counts surrogate halves, so a rare CJK character measures twice on
 one side of a ratio and once on the other. Every comparison this serves runs
 between a Chinese source and an English translation, which is exactly where
 that asymmetry lands, and it lands in the unsafe direction: a doubled source
 size halves a ratio and passes a pairing a guard would otherwise refuse.

 An index scan stepping one whole code point at a time ({@link codePointAt}),
 rather than spreading or `Array.from`, both of which the linter refuses over
 strings for breaking grapheme clusters. A pair counts once and a lone half
 counts once, as the string's own iteration reads them (ledger B22): counting
 every unit that is not a second half, as this did, read a lone second half
 as nothing.

/**
 The opening of a text, at most a number of UTF-16 units long, that never

 surrogate pair, the first half is left out too (ledger B21). A cut by
 `slice` alone kept half an emoji in an error's excerpt, a stream's opening
 and a refused reply's opening, and the log showed `\ud83d` or a
 replacement character. A lone first half no pair follows is a whole
 character as the string reads it, and stays (ledger B22).

 Orders two texts by code point, the same on every machine: the first code
 point that differs decides, and a text that runs out first comes first.

 NOT `localeCompare`, whose order follows the runtime's locale and collation
 data, so two machines could order one list two ways and draw a different
 benchmark from one corpus (ledger B95). NOT `<` on the strings either, which
 compares UTF-16 units and so puts a character past U+FFFF, whose first unit
 is a surrogate, before one between U+E000 and U+FFFF.
