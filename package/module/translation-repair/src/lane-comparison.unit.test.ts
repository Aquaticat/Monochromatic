/**
 * Tests for the slice-by-slice comparison of the two lanes.
 *
 * The comparison exists to answer one question, whether repair and translate
 * produce the same English where both touch a slice, and it has one hard
 * requirement: it must read what each DOCUMENT carries rather than what each
 * lane chose. A slice whose replacement the assembly guard withdrew chose one
 * thing and shipped another, and a comparison that read the choice would report
 * a rewrite no reader ever saw.
 *
 * It takes each lane's DELIVERY LEDGER rather than its wordings and an index
 * set. The ledger has already refused a decided slice that is neither shipped,
 * withdrawn, nor blocked, so what a document carries arrives as a stated fact;
 * reading an index set here meant an omitted shipped index was indistinguisable
 * from a lane that kept the archive.
 *
 * Fixtures are invented. No corpus content appears here.
