// LEDGER S20. The critic and editor sheets keep a phrase the ORIGINAL writes
// in another language in its wording with its meaning alongside, and the
// critic reports its absence as policy/foreign-phrase-gloss. A Japanese title
// or handle is such a phrase by the letter of that rule, yet the house title
// and handle rules let its English form stand alone, the original wording at
// most after it in parentheses; so a correct *The Spider's Thread* could be
// reported for dropping 蜘蛛の糸. Both sheets carry this one sentence.
