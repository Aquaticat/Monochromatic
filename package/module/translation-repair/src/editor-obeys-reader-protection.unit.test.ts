/**
 * Tests that the stage which REWRITES memorial text is told what this corpus is

 *
 * THE FAILURE THIS GUARDS is the one `house-policy.ts` was written for, stated
 * in its own header: a page that keeps a suicide method vague is obeying the
 * corpus's rule, a critic ignorant of that rule files it as an omission, and
 * the editor RESTORES the detail the rule exists to remove. The critic was
 * given the block. The editor was not, while five rules in its own sheet told
 * it that every detail of the original must survive and that an omission must
 * be translated in full sentences with nothing dropped.
 *
 * BOTH PATHS ARE COVERED. A calibration addendum builds a different system
 * prompt, and a policy that reached only one of the two would be absent from
 * every call in a run that uses an addendum.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention.
