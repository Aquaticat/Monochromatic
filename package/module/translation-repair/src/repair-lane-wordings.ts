//region Repair lane wordings
// The repair lane's settled outcomes turned into the shared per-slice wording
// shape, with each slice's outcome named rather than inferred.
//
// The mirror of `translate-lane-wordings.ts`, and it exists for the same reason
// that one does: the translation from a lane's own vocabulary into the shared
// one is not mechanical, and doing it inline let a silence pass as a choice.
//
// Here the silence is structural. This lane mends existing English, so at a
// passage the archive never translated there is nothing for it to work on: it
// logs that, records an outcome carrying the empty string, and moves on. Handed
// straight to the builder, every one of those became `decided` with an empty
// wording, and a lane comparison then reported the two lanes choosing DIFFERENT
// wordings wherever the translate lane filled the passage. The repair lane had
// no opinion there at all.
//
// THE OTHER SILENCE IS A LOST STAGE, and it looked identical until `#112`.
// Every producing voice can fail: with all six critics erroring and the
// naturalness lane silent, the lane settles the archive's own wording and
// reported that as a DECISION too. Nobody looked at that slice. It is
// `incumbent-fallback`, the archive standing by default, and the difference
// matters to every rate taken over these rows: a lane that heard nobody all
// document otherwise measures as one that examined everything and approved.

/**
 * Builds the repair lane's per-slice wordings from its settled outcomes.
 *
 * @param slices - preparation the lane ran over, which supplies every incumbent
 * and says which slices the archive never translated
 *
 * @param outcomes - what the lane settled, anchors included, in any order,
 * each carrying who was heard about it
 *
 * @param undecided - what an unnamed gap means; `refuse` after assembly, where
 * every slice was visited, and `not-evaluated` at the blocked exit, which stops
 * partway through by design
 *
 * @returns One wording per prepared slice, in document order
 *
 * @throws {@link LaneSliceCoverageError} when the outcomes do not cover the
 * preparation as the policy requires
 *
 * @throws {@link RepairUnheardError} when a slice nobody spoke about carries a
 * wording that is not the archive's
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const wordings = repairLaneWordings({ slices, outcomes, undecided: 'refuse', },);
 * ```
