/**
 Guards the owner's answer of 2026-09-27 ("Allow it, because it's the proper
 name of an org."): a term that stands inside an organization's proper name
 is not the term there, so the floor, the sheet lines and the departures
 leave the name in its own form, while the ruling of 2026-09-24 holds
 everywhere else
 (`doc/decision/translation-repair-community-glossary.md`).

 The originals are cat-themed invention built around the entry's own listed
 contexts, so no corpus sentence appears here.
