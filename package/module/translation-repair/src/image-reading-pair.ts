//region Image reading pair
// READING ONE PICTURE TWICE, and letting the two readers decide whether either
// reading may be used.
//
// WHY A SECOND READER IS THE CHECK. What a reading has to earn is not
// plausibility but IDENTITY: is this a reading of the picture we sent. Nothing
// in one reading answers that, and the archive's own transcript cannot answer
// it either, for the two reasons `reading-corroboration.ts` records. Two models
// shown the same picture, neither shown the other's answer, agree about what it
// says when they can read it and do not when they cannot.
//
// THEY ARE NOT JUDGING EACH OTHER. Neither reader sees the other's reading and
// neither is asked whether it is sensible. Both are asked the same question
// about the same picture, blind, and the two answers are compared mechanically.
// A model judging a model is another failure surface; two witnesses are not.
//
// AN UNCORROBORATED READING IS UNAVAILABLE, not usable-with-a-caveat. This
// follows the rule the whole reading stage is built on: falling back costs
// nothing that exists today, since the passage is protected and left alone,
// while trusting a wrong reading licenses replacing a human's transcription
// with something derived from a misreading. A caveat travelling downstream is a
// caveat somebody has to remember.
//
// A FAILING READER COSTS ITS OWN READING AND NOTHING ELSE. Reading is the only
// stage in the pipeline whose output nothing requires, so it is also the only
// one that must never be able to fail an entry. It could, until the first real
// CLI run said so: `wangzihao980`, six pictures gathered, one reader looping on
// `picture1.webp` until the client's runaway guard ended the call, and the
// entry finishing `status=ERROR` with `processed=0`. Both lanes were lost to a
// transcription nobody needed. `Promise.allSettled` plus an explicit abort
// check is the containment; the abort still travels, because a stop is not a
// failure to absorb.
//
// WHAT THAT COSTS. It used to be 31 pictures: the ones that fit the larger
// reader's allowance and not the smaller one's, which could therefore never be
// corroborated. THAT FIGURE IS VOID, and it is worth saying why rather than
// quietly deleting it, because it was measured carefully from a premise that
// was wrong.
//
// The allowance it measured against was derived here, from half a model's
// context converted to base64 characters. A vision model does not tokenize an
// image that way. Sent as they are, both readers accept every asset in the
// corpus, up to the largest at 1344454 bytes. So the 31 were refused by this
// package and by nothing else, and the number described an estimate rather than
// the world. Every picture can now be offered to both readers, and the only
// ones that go uncorroborated are the ones the readers themselves cannot agree
// on.
//
// A PICTURE THE READERS AGREE CARRIES NOTHING IS A VERDICT, not a shortfall,
// since 2026-09-04. The deterministic reader gates on presence at 16
// characters, and a painting's canvas texture can clear that line as noise:
// `Uekawakuyuurei/IMG_1308.webp` returned 24 characters from tesseract and
// every model asked about it said, truthfully, that it carries no text. Those
// replies were screened as refusals, the pair ended `no-reader-available` and
// transient, the verdict was read again on every run, and the entry stopped at
// the completeness gate each time, on both rosters. Two readers reporting
// absence, or answering with fewer characters than a transcript (the hull
// number on `img370.webp`), now confirm what the deterministic reader could
// not: the picture is textless past its noise. Nothing travels to the sheets
// from such a verdict, exactly as from the deterministic one.
