// HOW MANY SEATS A ROUND ASKS, since 2026-09-09: quorum plus one spare, from
// a bench rotated by the prompt, with the rest held back for the retry rounds.
//
// EVERY ROUND USED TO ASK THE WHOLE BENCH. On the first `noname` pass of
// 2026-09-09, 1,430 seats were asked across 229 rounds where quorum needed
// about 810, and the surplus was not free: the round waited a grace window
// on it, then abandoned what had not come, and on the per-token provider an
// abandoned stream was still generated and billed. The select stage alone
// asked 496 seats for 70 rounds of quorum 4. The owner's instruction of that
// day, after 200 USD went in a day, was to do everything to stop bleeding.
//
// QUORUM IS UNCHANGED. It is still at least half the bench, rounded up
// (`roster-quorum-size.ts`), computed over the whole bench; what changes is
// that the seats needed to reach it are asked first and the others only when
// a voice is lost. The one spare keeps a single lost voice from costing a
// second round every time, which at the measured loss rate (125 of 1,430
// voices on that pass, 8.7 percent) is what most rounds would otherwise pay.
//
// ROTATED BY THE PROMPT, deterministically, so the same slice asks the same
// seats on a re-run and different slices spread their first asks across the
// bench instead of always sparing the same tail. A round that reaches quorum
// on its window never asks the rest.
