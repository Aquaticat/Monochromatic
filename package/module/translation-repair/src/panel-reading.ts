// WHY THE TALLY WAS NOT ENOUGH, and why this gate matters more than the two
// that already record their ballots. `VoteTally` is five weighted numbers, and
// the status derived from them decides whether a claim becomes an issue the
// pipeline repairs AT ALL. Everything downstream is conditioned on that
// decision. Without the ballots a settled run cannot say whether an acceptance
// was unanimous or one weighted vote wide, cannot name the panelist that
// dissented, and cannot be re-tallied under a different weight table, because
// `voteWeight` folds `AdjudicationConfig.weights` into the sums before they are
// stored.
//
// The resolution checkers and the introduced-defect probe both keep their
// ballots and their seated roster per issue. The stage that decides what is
// worth repairing kept less.
