/**
 Tests for the sheet that asks a model to pair two documents' sections.
 
 THE FENCE IS THE ADVERSARIAL CASE. Both sides are arbitrary prose from an
 archive nobody vets, and a section carrying a run of the fence character
 (`=`, which a setext heading underline is made of) would close its own
 listing under a fixed fence: everything after it would read as sheet
 structure, and a model would be answering about a document the sheet no
 longer describes.
 
 Fixtures are cat-themed invention mirroring corpus structure only.
