//region Repair grading sheet
// The SECOND sheet: whether the text the pipeline wrote actually fixes the
// defect, graded apart from whether the defect was real.
//
// A separate sheet, not a second box on the detection sheet, and that is a
// measurement decision rather than a layout one. Showing a grader the proposed
// correction makes the alleged defect more salient, which moves the answer to
// "is this a real defect". Round two's precision was measured by a sheet that
// showed no repair, so folding repair text into round three's sheet would
// compare two rounds through two different instruments and quietly credit the
// change of instrument to the pipeline. The detection sheet is therefore left
// exactly as it was, and this one is graded AFTER it.
//
// Grading order matters and the header says so. An item graded N for detection
// has no meaningful repair grade: there was no defect to fix, so "did it fix
// it" has no answer, and a harmful edit to a false positive is a different
// question that this sheet does not ask.
//
// The sheet also never shows the checker verdict. Checkers confirmed 98.1% of
// repairs in the round-two artifacts, so revealing that would anchor the human
// toward agreement on precisely the population the human is there to audit.
