/**
 Guards class one hundred thirty-one (2026-09-25): under the owner's standing
 instruction of 2026-09-25 ("whenever you see anything that can be translated
 better do it"), words on one page join the rendering glossary. 辅导员 (whose
 calque reads as a therapist to an English reader), 矫正机构 (whose calque
 reads as a prison), 营救计划 and ICU 抢救 each shipped as a calque.

 The glossary audit of 2026-09-27 took out the class's entries keyed on one
 sentence's words (主动提出, 代替, 性格非常好) for the idiomatic English rule,
 seeded 抢救 as the word in place of ICU 抢救, and dropped 营救's refused
 forms, since a rescue operation is the English wherever the rescue is one
 (`glossary-dictionary-terms.unit.test.ts`).

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
