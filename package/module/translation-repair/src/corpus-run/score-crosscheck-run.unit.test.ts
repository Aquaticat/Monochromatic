/**
 Tests for the report `score-crosscheck` prints over a run's settled
 artifacts and a judge roster.

 Each case writes its own runs directory, hands it and a roster to
 `printCrosscheck` and reads the whole of what was printed, or the refusal
 that stopped it. The roster is handed in, so a case seats two judges where
 the command seats the run's eight.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
