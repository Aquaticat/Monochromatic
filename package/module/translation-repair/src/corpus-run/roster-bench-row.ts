   says nothing alone: a model whose translations are better would do that
   without any favouritism. The paired comparison needs to know what judges
   holding NO stake in the same candidate thought of it, and that needs the
   slate and the ballots rather than a sum.

   This is the cheaper of the two routes to that number. The other is the
   per-slice selection field in the settled artifact, which answers it
   corpus-wide instead of on a bench.
