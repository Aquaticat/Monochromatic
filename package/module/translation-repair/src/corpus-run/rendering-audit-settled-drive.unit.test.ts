/**
 Tests for the settled audit's drive over a real throwaway archive and corpus
 with a scripted client, reader, clock and runs directory: what it refuses
 before it prints, what it prints, what it asks, and what it keeps.

 No model is called and no real archive or clone is read: the client is the
 audit's scripted one, every auditor of which finds nothing, so every row
 holds an empty report that still names who was asked.

 CAPTURING `console.log` IS PROCESS-WIDE, which is why this file runs at
 `concurrency: 1`.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention on a throwaway git repository. No corpus
 content appears here.
