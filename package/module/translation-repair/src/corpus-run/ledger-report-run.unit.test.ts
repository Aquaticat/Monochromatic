/**
 Tests for the ledger report's procedure: what it reads, what it prints and
 which exit code each state returns.

 EACH STATE RETURNS ITS OWN EXIT CODE. A run that wrote no ledger, a run whose
 ledger was read in part and a run whose every file refused answer a roster
 question differently, and a gate reading the code must tell them apart, so
 every case here asserts the code beside the whole of what was printed.

 THE PROCEDURE SETS NO EXIT CODE ON THE PROCESS. It returns the code and the
 entry file sets it, so every case also asserts the process's own code unset;
 `ledger-report.unit.test.ts` holds the code the built command exits with.

 THE RUNS DIRECTORY IS HANDED IN. Every case writes its own ledger under a
 scratch directory and names it, so nothing here reads a real run.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
