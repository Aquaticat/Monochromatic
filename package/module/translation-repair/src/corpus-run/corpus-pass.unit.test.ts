/**
 Tests for `corpus-pass` as an operator meets it: the built command in a
 child process, read for what it prints and how it exits.

 NO CASE RAN THIS COMMAND BEFORE. Every child runs through
 `runBuiltWithoutKeys`, which removes every variable whose name ends in
 `_API_KEY` and every variable whose name starts `TRANSLATION_REPAIR_` from the
 child's environment before the case adds the locations it needs, so a case
 can neither spend nor read the operator's runs directory, lookup cache or
 corpus clone. The runs directory and the lookup cache are scratch
 directories and the corpus clone is a throwaway repository of invented pages.

 WHAT THE COMMAND DOES NOT LET A CASE BUILD: a run to its end. The run client
 is built before the `--plan` return and before the queue, whatever the corpus
 holds, and a child without a key stops there with a stated refusal. A child
 given a placeholder key would construct real provider clients, so no case
 does; the run's later stages are reached in the unit tests of the modules
 that hold them.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
