// That a lane's ledger describes THIS preparation, checked rather than assumed.
//
// The comparison refuses two ledgers naming different preparations, and that
// refusal says nothing about whether either names the RIGHT one: two ledgers
// built over some other slicing agree with each other perfectly. The builder is
// the only boundary holding all three, so a caller that passes the wrong
// preparation would otherwise get a clean artifact whose recorded identity
// names a slicing the lanes never ran over, which is this generation's own
// defect class one level up.
//
// TWO CHECKS, because neither implies the other:
//
//  -   THE NAME. Each ledger carries the identity of the slicing it was built
//      over, stamped by the driver that built it, and that identity covers what
//      a row cannot show: both whole documents, every slice's offsets on both
//      sides, the line-structure flag, and whether an identity block was in
//      play. Two preparations can agree on every field a ledger exposes and
//      still differ in all of those.
//  -   THE ROWS. An equal name is a hash claim; the four per-slice facts are
//      the ones this artifact actually joins on, and checking them turns a
//      collision or a mis-stamped ledger into a refusal here rather than into
//      rows filed under a slicing they do not describe.
//
// `buildSliceDelivery` already refuses three of the four against the slices IT
// was handed. This refuses them against the slices the ARTIFACT is about, which
// is a different claim whenever the two preparations are not the same object.
