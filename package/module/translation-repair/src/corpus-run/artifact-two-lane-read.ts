//region Artifact version 2 reading
// Reading one whole version 2 artifact, and refusing everything it cannot
// account for.
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT is a verification that the run happened as recorded. The
// artifact stores measurements of the two documents rather than the documents,
// so the preparation identity is checked for SYNTAX here and nothing more; a
// reader holding the corpus checkout and the matching pipeline can rebuild the
// preparation and check the rest through a separate entry point that takes one.
// Saying so out loud is the point: a syntax check read as a verification is
// exactly the kind of absence this generation exists to stop recording.
//
// WHAT IT DOES DO is refuse every internal contradiction a file alone can show:
// a key this version does not name, a union member it cannot project, a ledger
// its own raw result disagrees with, an index set its rows do not produce, a
// status the deliveries could not have come from, a row whose two axes cannot
// both be true, and a recorded comparison the ledgers do not derive.
