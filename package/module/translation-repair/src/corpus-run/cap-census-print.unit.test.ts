/**
 Tests for how the cap census reads on a terminal: the line of what was read,
 each seat's row, each provider's two readings and each flag's words.

 What is printed is read off `console.log` through a diverting capture, so a
 case sees the whole text and the terminal sees none of it. The capture is
 process-wide, which is why the suite runs one case at a time.

 Rows are invented over a roster seat, with invented counts.
