//region Cap census report
// THE PRE-LAUNCH READING OF THE COMPLETION CAPS (ledger P10). Reads pass-run
// logs, applies the cap rule per seat, and says where a card and its calls
// disagree. Spends no quota and touches no model.
//
// PASS-RUN LOGS ONLY, as the 2026-09-28 re-read learned (ledger P7): suite,
// build and prototype logs carry fixture `SPEND` lines, so a log counts only
// when a line in its first few kilobytes opens `START tip=`.
//
// ONE LOG AT A TIME. The agent root holds thousands of logs, some large; each
// is opened only far enough to read its head, and a pass-run log's text is
// dropped once its samples are read, so memory holds samples, not logs.
//
// PRINTS IDS AND NUMBERS. A run log holds unlicensed corpus wording, and
// nothing here reads past the two line kinds the census needs.

/**
 Reads the named logs and prints the census.

 @param line - the census's command line, read whole by `reportingRefusals`,
 which refuses it when no path is named
