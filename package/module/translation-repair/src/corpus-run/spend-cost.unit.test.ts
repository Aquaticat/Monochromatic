/**
 * Tests for pricing a spend tally.
 *
 * THE ORDERING CASE IS BUILT TO FAIL IF THE SORT IS INHERITED. `tallySpend`
 * already returns seats by completion tokens, so a `priceTally` that kept that
 * order would pass any case where the two agree. The seats here disagree on
 * purpose: the one with ten times the tokens costs a quarter as much, because
 * the output rates it sits between differ by forty times.
 *
 * THE THREE BUCKETS ARE THE POINT. Metered and priced, metered and unknown to
 * the table, and flat-subscription. Only the first has a credit figure, and a
 * case for each is what stops the third being converted into a currency it does
 * not bill in.
 *
 * THE ROUND TRIP BINDS THE WHOLE CHAIN: a line `reportSpend` wrote, read by
 * `tallySpend`, priced by `priceTally`. That is the path a real report walks.
 *
 * Model identifiers come from the catalog. No corpus content appears here.
