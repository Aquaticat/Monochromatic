//region Coverage control probe run
// Can the coverage roster vote absence at all?
//
// The block-scale reading it produced is ninety-six answers with not one vote
// for absence. Read as a fact about the corpus, that says the translations
// carry everything. Read as a fact about the instrument, it says the evidence
// rule admits any non-empty quote, so absence is unreachable and the count
// means nothing. This runner separates the two.
//
// It asks the roster about real passages, DELETES THE SPANS THE ROSTER ITSELF
// ANCHORED ON, and asks again. Nothing else can choose the damage: coverage
// candidates are exactly the passages the aligners refuse to pair, so no
// pairing exists to say which target text renders one.
//
// SPENDS QUOTA, two roster rounds per case. Point `TRANSLATION_REPAIR_RUNS_DIR`
// at a throwaway directory.

 Runs the control and reports what it found.

 @param line - the control's command line, read whole by `reportingRefusals`

 @param pin - corpus clone and commit every read resolves against

 @param newClient - builds the client every call goes through, called before
 the entry filter is read, so a missing key is refused first

 @param holds - the control itself: asks the roster, deletes what it anchored
 on, and asks again

 @param roster - models asked

 @param exchangeTimeoutMs - deadline per exchange

 @param l - logger the control logs through

 @throws StatedRefusalError when no entry offered a single passage to ask
 about, since a run that measured nothing must not be reported as one that
 measured a null

 @example
 ```ts
 await runCoverageControl({ line, pin, newClient, holds, roster, exchangeTimeoutMs, l, },);
