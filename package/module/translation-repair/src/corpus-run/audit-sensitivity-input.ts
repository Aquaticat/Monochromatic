// THE ORACLE IS THE POINT OF THIS FILE. A live arm that only counted
// corroborated defects could not say WHY it found none: the auditors may have
// missed the defect, or found it and failed to anchor, or found and anchored it
// and been split apart by the matcher. Scoring each voice against a known span
// separates those three, and they call for three different fixes.
