//region Artifact version 2 corpus verification
// The checks a file ALONE cannot make, run against a preparation somebody else
// obtained.
//
// A version 2 artifact stores measurements of the two documents rather than the
// documents, so the standalone reader checks the recorded preparation identity
// for syntax and nothing more. That is a real limit and not a temporary one:
// `preparationIdentity` hashes both whole documents, every slice's placement
// and offsets, the line-structure flag and the identity context, and the file
// carries none of those.
//
// SO THE PREPARATION IS A PARAMETER, and what it is checked against is the
// artifact's MEASUREMENTS. A check that recomputed the identity and read both
// ledgers row by row against the preparation stood here until 2026-09-29: no
// rebuild matches a run's identity (ledger A12b), so nothing called it, and it
// went with the other functions only tests reached (ledger B30).
//
// EVERY REFUSAL IS A PARSE ERROR this file writes, naming the recorded field
// and both numbers, so a caller reading artifacts meets one error type from
// this layer. A wrapper that ran the writer's own count check and forwarded
// its message stood here until 2026-09-30; it could not fire, since the
// reader already ties each lane's count to the preparation's (ledger B34).

/**
 Checks what a parsed artifact measured of its preparation against a
 preparation: slice count, document sizes and alignment pairs.

 NOT EACH LANE'S SLICE COUNT, which the reader has already tied to the
 preparation's: every lane's ledger holds one row per prepared slice
 (`assertLedgerCoversPreparation`) and every lane's recorded count is its
 ledger's length (`assertIndexSetsMatchLedger`), so the preparation's count
 checked here answers for both lanes.

 SPLIT FROM THE IDENTITY CHECK (ledger A12b), since removed (ledger B30). The recorded identity also
 hashes the declared names as the run's build worded them, and the recorded
 alignment findings include the roster pairing rounds' own (mikaela16's six
 are all `block-pairing` lines), which a rebuild never runs, so it reports
 none over the same rows. A preparation rebuilt today matches neither; a
 rebuild whose rows reproduce the run's carve
 (`artifact-two-lane-rebuild-rows.ts`) is verified by these measurements
 instead.
