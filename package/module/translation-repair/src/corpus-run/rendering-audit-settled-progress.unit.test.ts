/**
 Tests for the line a settled audit prints for each slice as it lands: which
 text was audited, what a later stage made of it, and the counts beside them.

 CAPTURING `console.log` IS PROCESS-WIDE, which is why this file runs at
 `concurrency: 1`.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.

/**
 Builds one audited slice as the probe persists it, carrying only what the line reads.

 @param auditsArchiveText - whether the slice audited the archive's own English

 @param pageRelation - what a document would carry at the slice, absent to build a row from before the field existed

 @param voices - how many claims each voice anchored, one entry per voice

 @param tiers - how many entries each agreement tier and the degradation hold

 @returns Row shaped as the probe persists it

 @example
 ```ts
 const row = rowOf({ auditsArchiveText: false, pageRelation: { kind: 'survives', }, voices: [2, 1,], tiers: { corroborated: 1, agreed: 2, near: 0, degraded: 0, }, },);
