/**
 Tests for where run artifacts are written.
 
 `resolveRunsDir` had no test. Everything durable a run produces lands under
 the path it returns: artifacts, logs, the attempts map, and the grading
 sheets a human spends hours on. The sheet-path guard refuses to overwrite a
 final sheet, but that guard only protects paths under whatever this function
 resolved, so a wrong answer here relocates the entire protected area rather
 than defeating one check.
 
 The empty-string case is the one worth having. An exported-but-empty
 environment variable is a normal shell accident, and a bare truthiness check
 would treat it as an override, resolving every artifact path relative to the
 process working directory instead of the runs directory.
 
 The override is injected as a disposable so the variable is restored however
 a case ends, following the pattern in
 `package/pi-plugin/morph-compact/src/api-key.unit.test.ts`.

 The run client's cases build it with `runClientFrom` on an environment and
 a transport each case hands over (ledger M43, M68), so no case builds a
 client on a key the suite inherits or over the real Bedrock ledger; the one
 case of `createRunClient`, which reads the process's own, clears every key
 first and expects the refusal.
