//region Command line types
// What a runner declares it reads from its command line, and what the one

// Kept apart from the reader so the reader stays within the line budget, and
// so a module that only names these types imports nothing that runs.

 What a flag carried, or that nobody wrote it.

 NAMED RATHER THAN LEFT NULLISH because the two answers lead to opposite
 behaviour one line later: an unwritten flag takes a default, and a written
 one is read and may be refused. Each answer carries the flag as the person
 types it, so a reader refusing the value names the flag without being told
 it a second time.

 @example
 ```ts
 const asked: FlagValue = { kind: 'written', flag: '--cap', value: '4', };
 ```
 */
export type FlagValue = {
  readonly kind: 'written';

  /**
   Flag as typed, dashes included.

   What was written after it, never empty: an empty value is refused.
   */
  readonly value: string;
} | {
  readonly kind: 'unwritten';

  /**
   Flag as typed, dashes included.
   */
  readonly flag: string;

 ```ts
 const logs: PositionalSpec = { names: ['log file',], least: 1, rest: true, };
