/**
 * Tests for the percentile reader the corpus censuses share.
 *
 * THE RANK CONVENTION IS THE WHOLE SUBJECT. `percentileOf` takes
 * `floor(p / 100 * n)` and clamps it to the last index, which is one of several
 * defensible definitions and the only one the census lines mean. A later change
 * to the more common `ceil(p / 100 * n) - 1` would move every published p50 by
 * one rank on even-length samples without moving any test, so the cases below
 * pin the rank itself rather than only the shape of the line.
 *
 * THE CLAMP IS NOT DECORATION EITHER. Without it, p99 on a ten-value sample
 * reads index 9 and p100 reads index 10, which is past the end; the function
 * would return its `?? 0` fallback and report a far tail of zero for a sample
 * whose maximum is 200. That is the failure a distribution reader must not have,
 * because zero is a plausible-looking number.
