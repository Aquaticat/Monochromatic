// (`coverage-census-reading.ts`) so the git question it asks, which sources
// were edited since the baseline's commit, is handed in and scripted.

 Reads this run against each baseline, a source edited since the baseline's

 @param packageDirectory - package directory the edits are asked about

 @param claimed - sources the batch claims, empty for every source

 @param stretches - this run's cold stretches

 @param loadedSources - sources this run's loaded bundles carry

 @param editedSince - asks git which files of the work tree changed since a
 commit, passed in because it runs git

 @returns Each baseline's report lines, one list per baseline, in the order
 the baselines were named
