//region Runner closure
// WHICH CODE A RUN ACTUALLY EXECUTED, which the pipeline digest cannot say.
//
// `digestPipeline` hashes the whole built tree, so any two runs separated by any
// commit carry different stamps, including commits the runner never loads. That
// makes the one question a band measurement has to answer unanswerable from the
// recorded identity: two runs of byte-identical audit code report different
// digests, and nothing distinguishes that from a real change. `#115` hit exactly
// this and had to argue the point in prose instead of reading it off the file.
//
// THE ANSWER IS ALREADY ON DISK AND FREE. Rolldown emits content-hashed chunks,
// and the built entry names its own dependency closure in its import statements.
// Two runs whose closure matches ran the same code, checkable by string equality
// with no rebuild.
//
// BOTH ARE WORTH KEEPING. The tree digest answers "did the repository move at
// all", which is a real question about reproducibility. The closure answers "did
// THIS run's code move", which is the one a comparison needs.
//
// READ AT RUN START, never at the end, for the reason `#115` learned the
// expensive way: a rebuild mid-run otherwise stamps a build that never ran.
