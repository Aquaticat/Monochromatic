//region Per-slice re-seating under a hold
// ONE SHAPE FOR EVERY PHASE THAT RE-SEATS ITS SLICES (ledger X12). The repair
// lane's chunks (class one hundred three), the translate lane's slices and the
// consolidation's (ledger H5) and the lane contest's (ledger X12) each read
// their seats again before a slice while a named hold runs, which is the
// signal a dry-out leaves, hand the slice the roster read, and keep handing it
// over once the hold has ended, so the slices after a dry-out never fall back
// to the roster read before it. Three copies of that memo had grown before
// this one; a fourth phase takes this instead of a fifth copy.
//
// IT COSTS NOTHING WHILE NOTHING IS HELD: one synchronous read of the holds,
// no dryness read. Under a hold the reading itself waits out the shortest hold
// once when a bench the phase leans on cannot reach quorum
// (`run-seats-read.ts`).
