// Where a run of characters one test keeps ends, and where it starts reading
// back, for the page passes that scan prose a character at a time. `runEnd`
// lived in `canadian-date-parts.ts` and `runStart` in
// `canadian-spelling-context.ts`, and the pinyin tone pass kept its own copy
// of `runEnd` as `scanEnd` (audit area six, 2026-09-28); one home now serves
// them all.
//
// WHOLE CHARACTERS, AT UTF-16 OFFSETS (ledger B21). Both scans handed the test
// one UTF-16 unit, and neither half of a character beyond the first plane
// passes a test for a cased letter or for Han, so a Deseret letter ended a
// word and an Extension B ideograph ended a Han run. The test now reads each
// whole character, and the offsets returned stay UTF-16 offsets.
