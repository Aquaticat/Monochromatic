/**
 Tests for reporting a refusal instead of crashing out of a CLI.

 THE UNEXPECTED-FAULT CASES ARE THE ONES THAT CONSTRAIN THE DESIGN, and they
 replaced a forwarding case that pinned the opposite contract. That case
 checked a foreign class came straight back out, on the reasoning that
 catching every `Error` destroys the stack of a genuine programming fault.

 Re-throwing was shown not to be neutral: it hands the decision to whatever
 prints next, and Node's reporter renders a cause chain, which is how a YAML
 refusal published a page's front matter. So everything is caught now, and the
 cases in this file hold both halves at once: the message must NOT be repeated, and
 the frames MUST still be there.

 THREE EXIT CODES NOW, AND EACH IS DEFINED AGAINST THE OTHER TWO. One change
 closed the message of every class that had not declared itself quote-free,
 and a later rule decided which of our own may speak. So what a reader gets depends
 on the class thrown: a stated refusal says its sentence and stops at 6, a
 marked class that is not one says its sentence AND keeps its frames at 5, and
 everything else is named without being quoted. The cases in this file hold one of
 each, so a later change that collapses the three into one report fails here
 rather than in an operator's terminal.

 BOTH SWAPS ARE DISPOSABLE. `process.exitCode` is process-wide, so a case that
 set it and walked away would decide the whole suite's exit code, and a suite
 reporting 680 passes while exiting 4 is worse than a failing test.

 THE SUITE RUNS AT `concurrency: 1` FOR THE SAME REASON, and it was written
 without that first. `describe` runs children concurrently by default, so the
 three cases raced on `console.error` and on `process.exitCode`: one case saw
 zero captured lines because a sibling's disposal had already put the real
 reporter back, and another read `undefined` where it had just written zero.
 Both swaps are process-wide, and there is exactly one process here: the
 runner spawns `node` once per test FILE, so nothing outside this file is
 touched, and nothing inside it may overlap.
