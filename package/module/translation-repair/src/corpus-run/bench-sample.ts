 lists, quotes, fences, tables, comments, footnotes, math, line-structured
 blocks, lone tags and braces, with front matter, carriage returns and byte
 order marks, against English pages carrying the original's sections, another
 count of them, some dropped, or extra ones shuffled in. 5,773 pairs passed
 this step, 2,363 of them cut into 7,326 slices, and none ended on this line;
 the 227 pages built with front matter no parser accepts each printed their
 parse line, which shows the probe read every line the draw printed. The line
 stays for a broken invariant, which then skips the entry rather than ending
