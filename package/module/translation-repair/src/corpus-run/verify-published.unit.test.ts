/**
 Tests for `verify-published` as an operator runs it: the built CLI over a
 throwaway runs directory, read for what it prints and how it exits.

 A RUN ALWAYS SHIPS (the owner, 2026-09-27; ledger A16b): the verifier prints
 every finding and exits 0, keeping exit 2 for a run it could not read at
 all, which the last case holds as the control that the exit code is read.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
