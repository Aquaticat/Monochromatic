/**
 Tests for the report `score-attribution` prints over a runs directory.

 Each case writes its own runs directory, hands it to `printAttribution` and
 reads the whole of what was printed, the pool's own lines included, since
 those are part of what an operator sees.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
