/**
 Tests for reading one settled artifact into the shape a draw samples from.
 
 THIS READER FEEDS THE PRECISION GATE, which is what makes its refusals worth
 more than its happy path. Every issue it hands back becomes a row a human
 grades, and the rate computed from those rows gets quoted as the pipeline's
 precision. An entry that joins the pool unverified does not produce a wrong
 number visibly; it produces a slightly short denominator, silently, and the
 rate over it still looks like a measurement.
 
 SO THE CASES ARE ALL REFUSALS, and one of them is about ORDER. An artifact can
 be both substituted and short at once, and which refusal comes out decides
 what an operator goes looking for. Provenance is checked first on purpose: a
 file that is not the entry the pool admitted has to be reported as the wrong
 file, not as a file with the wrong number of issues in it.
 
 THE HAPPY PATH READS AN INVENTED SOURCE. `loadEntry` bands an entry by
 reading its source at the pinned corpus commit, and a run reads the unlicensed
 clone; a unit suite that required the clone would pass on one machine and
 fail everywhere else, so the load cases hand `loadEntry` a reader returning a
 fixture page (ledger T8). Every guard this file tests runs BEFORE that read,
 so none of them needs one.
 
 FIXTURES ARE INVENTED AND CAT-THEMED, and every one is written into a
 throwaway directory that is removed when the case ends.
