//region Settled carve
// Carving a corpus entry the way the pass carved it when it settled.
//
// THE ONE ENTRY POINT FOR INSTRUMENTS. Every probe and census that measures
// slices used to call the bare `prepareDocumentPair` over the corpus, under a
// comment claiming "slices exactly as the lanes would see them". The lanes see
// slices the roster shell carved, and the only durable record of that carve is
// the settled artifact, so an instrument wanting the lanes' slices reads the
// artifact's recipe and rebuilds through it. An entry with no settled artifact
// has no such slicing to measure, and says so rather than substituting the
// deterministic carve under the same name.
//
// THE PIN COMES FROM THE ARTIFACT, as the rendering audit's does: the run pin
// can move, and a recipe recorded against one commit describes that commit's
// pair of documents, not whatever the pin now names.
//
// THE CARVE IS `rebuildPreparation`'S, not a second one here (ledger F-6, A18).
// A carve of its own called `prepareDocumentPair` without the front-matter
// authority and the seal the artifact's generation carved with, shifting slice
// indices by one on archive-authority entries, and over the corpus copy rather
// than the archive the pass reshaped and stored.
