//region Coverage probe run
// PROTOTYPE for question 28: can a roster tell a passage the translation merged
// from one it never rendered.
//
// WHAT IT MEASURES AND WHY IT IS WORTH QUOTA. It was established that neither
// aligner produces evidence of absence, at either scale, and that the
// deterministic substitutes are exhausted: heading Latin, section length and
// distinctive body tokens were each measured and none of them separates a
// translated passage from an absent one when the two sides share no characters.
// What is left is semantic. This asks the semantic question directly, over the
// passages the aligners actually refuse, and records what came back so the
// answer to question 28 rests on a measurement rather than on an expectation.
//
// IT DECIDES NOTHING. No slicing, no artifact and no lane reads its output.
//
// IT ASKS THE SHEET A PAGE WITH NO DECLARED NAMES GETS. It reads raw archives,
// not a prepared pair, so it has no declared identity to pass; production
// coverage has read the page's declared names since ledger B28, and a rerun
// measures the sheet without them.
//
// IT DOES KEEP ITS ANSWERS, which it did not always. It used to print rows to
// standard output and write nothing, on the reasoning that a caller would
// redirect them wherever the measurement was being kept. Nobody did, and both
// scales were probed on 2026-08-16 at real quota cost, and those numbers
// survived only in session transcripts. Every run now lands in
// the runs directory under `coverage-probe/` as well, carrying the corpus pin,
// the roster and the pipeline digest that produced it.
//
// AND THAT REDIRECT WOULD NOT HAVE WORKED ANYWAY, which is worth knowing
// because it is why the file is the answer rather than better discipline.
// Measured at the boundary on 2026-08-17: this module's tagged logger writes to
// STANDARD OUTPUT, the same stream the rows JSON goes to, and it logs a line
// per candidate as it goes. So `coverage-probe > rows.json` yields progress
// lines wrapped around a JSON document, which no parser accepts. The rows have
// never been recoverable that way for any run that actually probed anything.
//
// STANDARD OUTPUT IS OTHERWISE UNCHANGED and gains only the line saying where
// the file went, so nothing a caller does today breaks.

/**
 Asks the roster about every unpaired passage it is given, up to the cap.

 @param line - the probe's command line, read whole by `reportingRefusals`

 @param pin - corpus clone and commit every read resolves against

 @param newClient - builds the client for every exchange, called after the
 command line is read, so a bad flag is refused before a key is asked for

 @param stage - the roster's answer about one passage

 @param roster - models asked

 @param exchangeTimeoutMs - deadline per exchange

 @param readDigest - digest over built output, read at the start of the run,
 not the end: a rebuild mid-run would otherwise stamp a build that never ran

 @param readClosure - chunks the executing entry imports, read at the start
 for the same reason

 @param resolveRunsDir - directory the answers are kept under, resolved when
 they are kept

 @param now - the present instant as ISO 8601, read when the run begins and
 when it ends

 @param log - logger every progress line goes to

 @throws StatedRefusalError when the command line is malformed, or when an
 entry named is no entry of the corpus at the pin

 @example
 ```ts
 await runCoverageProbe({ line, pin, newClient, stage, roster, exchangeTimeoutMs, readDigest, readClosure, resolveRunsDir, now, log, },);
 ```
