/**
 Tests for the reader the coverage census hands its bundle and source reads,
 which a case replaces with a scripted one to choose which read ends first:
 the real one reads a file whole as UTF-8 and rejects with the filesystem's
 own failure. Each case writes into a disposable directory. Names are
 cat-themed invention.
