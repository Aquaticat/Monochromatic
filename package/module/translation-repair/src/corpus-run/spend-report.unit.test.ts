/**
 Tests for the spend report command at its boundary: the built command run in
 a child process over logs the case writes.

 The command spends no quota and asks no model, so what only the built command
 can show is what an operator meets: the whole report on stdout, and a refusal
 as one line with the exit code a stated refusal leaves. The functions it
 prints with have their own files.

 THE CHILD CARRIES NO PROVIDER KEY. `runBuiltReport` removes every variable
 whose name ends in `_API_KEY` from the environment it hands the child and
 points the runs directory at a scratch directory, so nothing here reads a real
 run.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
