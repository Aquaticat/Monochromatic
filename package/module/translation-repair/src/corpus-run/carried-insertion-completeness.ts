//region Carried insertion completeness
// READ THE PAGE THE WAY THE EVIDENCE WAS READ. A carried region is a quote the
// roster anchored through `locateQuote`, which folds soft line breaks and
// normalizes punctuation before it looks, so a region may span a break the
// archive never wrote. The semantic wrap (`consolidate-wrap.ts` and the two
// lane assemblies) then breaks a shipped slice at its clauses: the fifth
// `yuki418330012` launch of 2026-09-08 shipped
// `Contributors for this entry:\nZhenli,\nSansan,\nSuona` where the archive
// had it on one line, the region was read byte for byte against it, and the
// pass stopped as `carried-evidence-lost` with every word of the credits on
// the page. The twentieth class. Folded the same way on both sides, a moved
// break is nothing and a lost word is still lost.
