/**
 Tests for the width probe's written report.

 THIS MODULE IS WHY THE COVERAGE MEASURE WAS REBUILT. It was the one exported
 function in the package whose module no test path reached, and it is live:
 `editor-width-probe.ts` calls it, and that probe is an operator entry script
 no test imports, so nothing carried a test to it. See
 `doc/planning/translation-repair-coverage-measure.md`.

 THE CASE WORTH THE FILE IS THE FAILED POSITIVE CONTROL. Before a width reading
 means anything, the panel has to be shown able to prefer intact text over the
 same text with a sentence removed. When it cannot, every count in the report is
 unreadable, and a report that printed them in the same voice either way would
 launder a broken instrument into a result. That is the exact failure this
 package keeps finding, so the report has to SAY the numbers are unreadable
 rather than merely omit a tick.

 THE SECOND CASE IS ABOUT NOT LOSING A READING. The sample is split in two so a
 result landing near its own null band has a second, untouched half available.
 That only holds if draw B lands beside draw A rather than on top of it, and a
 report writer keying both to one filename would destroy the very thing the
 split exists to preserve, silently, after the calls are paid for.

 Rows are invented. They carry no passage text by construction: `WidthRow`
 keeps counts and verdicts precisely because the corpus is unlicensed.
