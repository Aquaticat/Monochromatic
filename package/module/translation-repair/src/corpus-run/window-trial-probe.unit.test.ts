/**
 Boundary test for the window trial command.

 The command spends quota and is composition over modules with their own
 suites, so what is checked here is the one thing only the built command can
 show: launched without both provider keys it refuses as stated, exits 6, and
 never reaches a call. The environment handed to the child carries no key, so
 the case cannot spend anything whatever the runner's own environment holds.
