/**
 Tests for the fidelity probe's run over scripted references, judges and clock:
 what it refuses before anything is read, what a zero cap says, what a bounded
 and a complete run write to disk and print, and in which order.

 No model is called and no corpus clone is read: the reference reader and the
 client builder are handed in, so every ballot is a scripted reply. The real
 reviewed manifest supplies the request's specifications, and the invented
 cat texts of the fixture module stand in for what the pinned clone would hold.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
