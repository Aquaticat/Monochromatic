/**
 Tests for how the meter report writes a span of time, an instant and the
 longest outage a provider had.

 EVERY UNIT A DURATION IS WRITTEN IN IS CHECKED PRESENT AND ABSENT: a span
 drops the units that carry nothing, so `2h0m5s` reads as `2h5s`, and says `0s`
 for none rather than an empty string.

 AN OUTAGE NAMES ITS OPEN ENDS. A stretch with no wet reading before it may
 have begun before the record, one with none after it may still be running, and
 in either case its upper bound is not a number. Each of the four ways the two
 ends can stand is a case.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
