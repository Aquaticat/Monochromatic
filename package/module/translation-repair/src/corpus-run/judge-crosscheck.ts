//region Judge crosscheck census
// Which claims a disinterested judge may re-examine, and what the reading is
// allowed to conclude from the answer.
//
// A CENSUS, NOT A SAMPLE. Every attributed claim in every attributed entry is
// enumerated, because the eligible population is small enough to judge whole
// and a sampler would add a seed, a bias question and a reproducibility burden
// for nothing. If the population outgrows the budget, cap it here and say so;
// do not quietly sample.
//
// TWO ARMS, and the control is the point. Judging only accepted claims yields
// an agreement rate with nothing to compare against: a roster that says
// `supported` to everything scores identically to one that reads carefully.
// The control arm re-asks the same judges about claims the panel did NOT
// accept. A crosscheck worth citing agrees with the panel more on the accepted
// arm than on the control arm, and the gap between the two is the finding.
// Equal rates mean the judges are not discriminating and the accepted-arm
// number means nothing on its own.

/**
 Which side of the crosscheck a claim sits on.

 `undecided` is separated from `control` rather than folded into it, and the
 distinction is the difference between a rate and an average over two
 incommensurable things. `rejected` means the panel DECIDED AGAINST the
 claim, so there is a verdict for a judge to agree or disagree with.
 `needs-human` means the panel DECLINED TO DECIDE, so agreement is undefined:
 there is no verdict to survive re-asking. Measured on this run those claims
 lean supported 228 to 23, so filing them as control would fill the control
 arm with claims the panel mostly believed.

 From ledger L5 on, `needs-human` also holds a claim a supported majority
 settled at neutral, the severity that asserts no defect, so there is no
 defect for a judge to confirm. Such claims leave the accepted arm for the
 undecided one, and on runs from `SLICE_CACHE_VERSION` 34 the accepted arm's
 precision reads higher by construction against earlier runs.

 `source-defect` sits in `control` because it IS a verdict, the panel ruling
 the original text wrong at the claimed spot rather than the translation.
