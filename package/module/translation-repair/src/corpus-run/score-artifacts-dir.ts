/**
 Refuses a runs directory whose artifacts directory cannot be listed.

 A directory that is not there says the run was pointed somewhere wrong, which
 is an answer, where the listing's own failure reaches the operator as a fault
 in the command with a stack and no path. A directory that is there and holds
 nothing is left to the pool, which states that refusal itself.

 @param artifactsDir - directory the pass writes entries into

 @throws {@link StatedRefusalError} when the directory is absent, is not a
 directory or cannot be listed, naming the path and the filesystem reason

 @example
 ```ts
 await requireArtifactsDir({ artifactsDir: artifactsDirOf({ runsDir, },), },);
 ```
