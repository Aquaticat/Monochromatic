/**
 Tests for what the ledger report prints, one printer at a time.

 EACH PRINTER IS HANDED THE READING IT PRINTS, so a case states the whole
 reading and asserts the whole text it produced. A count noun is shown at one
 and at several, since the report once printed a count before a fixed plural.

 THE EXCERPT IS CHECKED AT ITS CUT. A candidate longer than the excerpt is
 shown to a whole character only, and the report says it was cut, because
 candidate text is the evidence a reader weighs and a reader who cannot tell a
 whole candidate from an opening reads the opening as the whole.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
