// Says whether two audit rows were shown the same characters, without keeping
// the characters.
//
// WHY A DIGEST AND NOT THE TEXT. The only question a repeat reading asks of
// the text is whether two rows saw the same one, and a digest answers exactly
// that and nothing more, so THIS FIELD carries none. That is a claim about the
// identity field alone: the `report` beside it on the row persists document
// spans and model prose, which the row module says, and a run file of this
// probe is therefore corpus-bearing whatever this field holds.
//
// WHY BOTH SIDES. A repeat is only a repeat when the ORIGINAL and the RENDERING
// both match. Two artifacts of one entry can carry identical source at a slice
// and different English there, which is a comparison of two renderings rather
// than two readings of one, and it belongs in the archive-versus-fresh split
// instead.
//
// AND THE REFERENCES (ledger B29). An auditor shown what the pages the
// original links say is answering a different question from one shown none,
// so two rows over one pair are a repeat only when they were shown the same
// references, or none.
