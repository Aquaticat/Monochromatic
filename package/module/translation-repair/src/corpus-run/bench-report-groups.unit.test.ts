/**
 * Tests that the bench summary GROUPS ITS ROWS by the width and pass they were
 * recorded at.
 *
 * WHAT THE REPORT IS FOR. The bench runs the same slices at more than one
 * roster width, more than once, and prints one line per width and pass. Every
 * number on a line, the slice count, the declines, the calls, the tokens and
 * the milliseconds per slice, is a sum over whichever rows the grouping put
 * there. Group them wrong and each line is a confident description of the wrong
 * arm, with nothing in the output saying so.
 *
 * WHAT WAS MEASURED. On 2026-08-25, inverting the width filter failed no test
 * in this package. The lines would then have carried each other's rows, which
 * is precisely the comparison the bench exists to make.
 *
 * BOTH FILTERS ARE PINNED, since the rows here differ in width AND in pass, and
 * the counts are chosen so no two groups hold the same number of rows: a line
 * describing another group's rows cannot then coincide with the right answer.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
