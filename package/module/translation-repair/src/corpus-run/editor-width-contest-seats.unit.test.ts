/**
 * Tests that the width head-to-head SWAPS THE SEATS, which is its whole reason
 * for existing.
 *
 * WHAT POSITION BIAS IS. A panel shown two candidates does not weigh them
 * evenly; whichever sits first draws votes for sitting first. The comparison
 * cancels that by asking the same question twice with the seats exchanged, and
 * reading a winner only where both orders agree.
 *
 * WHAT WAS MEASURED. On 2026-08-25, seating the NARROW arm in BOTH places of
 * the first order failed no test in this package. The panel would then have
 * been asked to choose between one arm and itself, its answer would have been
 * meaningless, and the head-to-head would have gone on reporting agreement
 * between two orders of which one asked nothing.
 *
 * READ OFF THE SHEETS THE JUDGES WERE SENT, not off the verdict. A verdict is a
 * value the reader cannot trace back to a slate, and the defect here is
 * entirely in what the panel was shown.
 *
 * NO NETWORK. One judge is seated and answers every ballot with the first
 * candidate; the client records the sheet each exchange carried.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
