//region Page assembly guard
// THE COMPOSED PAGE THROUGH THE SAME GUARD EACH LANE RUNS. What the polish, the
// consolidation and the contest chose per slice is spliced over the archive
// the way the page will be, and the assembly guard trims an orphan definition
// out of a definitions-only slice, withdraws a slice that breaks the footnote
// graph or the parse, and names what it did. The outcome is recorded in the
// artifact (`artifact-two-lane-page-assembly.ts`) rather than acted on here, so
// the page a reader composes from the artifact is the page the guard settled.

/**
 Runs the assembly guard over the page the artifact would ship.
 
 @param artifact - artifact as composed before the guard, carrying no page
 assembly yet
 
 @param slices - preparation defining replacement spans
 
 @param sourceText - the original document, whose headings set how many
 distinct headings the page owes (class forty-five)
 
 @param targetText - archive text the replacement spans address
 
 @param archiveOriginalSpans - spans sealed as the English original, which
 the Canadian forms pass leaves as the archive has them
 
 @returns What the guard trimmed, withdrew and found
 
 @example
 ```ts
 const pageAssembly = guardPageAssembly({ artifact, slices, sourceText, targetText, },);
