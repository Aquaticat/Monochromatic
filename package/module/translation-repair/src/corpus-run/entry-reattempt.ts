//region Entry reattempt
// Why a capped entry gets another go INSIDE one invocation, and what stops it.
//
// The largest entries cannot settle inside `HARD_CAP_MINUTES` in one attempt.
// `#196` measured XingZ60 at 45 repair-lane slices in 4 h 51 m of a 420-minute
// cap, with 119 slices prepared and a translate lane of the same size behind
// it, and recorded three ways out. Its first was to run such an entry as a
// SEQUENCE of attempts against a frozen build, noted as costing nothing to
// build and needing the build to stop moving.
//
// THE BUILD ALREADY STOPS MOVING, for exactly as long as one invocation. The
// pass digests `dist/final/node` once before its loop and every cache it opens
// is namespaced by that digest, so nothing landing in the repository can
// invalidate a cache while the loop runs. What actually prevented the sequence
// was scheduling alone: the loop ran over a list built before it started, so a
// capped entry was visited once and the invocation moved on to other entries
// for up to the three-day soft budget.
//
// So the sequence needs neither a frozen build nor operator discipline. It
// needs the loop to come back, and the cost of coming back is nothing, because
// the slices the capped attempt bought are already on disk.
//
// WHAT STOPS IT COMING BACK FOREVER is the harder half, and this codebase had
// already written the hazard down in `corpus-pass.ts`: no progress guarantee
// holds. An abort can land before the first persistence, and the slices a lane
// deliberately leaves uncached, the unfilled and the unheard, produce no cache
// entry however long they took. A loop that retried until settled would spend a
// three-day budget on one entry that never moves, which is worse than the cap.
//
// This decides on MEASURED progress instead. An attempt that left more slices
// cached than it found has moved the entry forward and earns another; one that
// left the same number has not and does not. That reads the thing a second
// attempt is actually for, since its whole value is the cache the first one
// filled.
//
// WHAT COUNTS AS PROGRESS IS EVERY CACHE RECORD, not only a translated slice,
// and that is deliberate rather than incidental. `slice-cache-namespace.ts`
// gives the pairing, contest, refine and translate records the same `.json`
// suffix in the same per-entry directory, so all of them are counted here.
//
// The first live run, 2026-08-24, is what this is written from. Its first
// attempt spent 45 seconds buying two block pairings and was then cut, and
// those two records are the whole of what it banked. They earned the
// re-attempt, and the re-attempt reached the lanes in 0.16 seconds instead of
// 45 by reading them back. Had setup cached anywhere else, the largest entries,
// which are the ones this exists for, would have stalled on every first
// attempt.
