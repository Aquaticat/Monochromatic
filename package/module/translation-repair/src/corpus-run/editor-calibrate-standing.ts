/**
 Whether a round was judged: at least one ballot was cast over its slate.

 THE ONE PLACE THE EDITOR CALIBRATION DECIDES IT. A slate of one candidate,
 which is what every editor proposing the same wording leaves, needs no vote
 and records a round with no ballot; the standing and the closing paragraph
 once read such a round two ways, the standing counting it as judged and the
 closing as a judged round on its slice, while every row of the standing
 read `UNJUDGED`.

 @param round - one round a seat produced, which every printer of the
 calibration reads through this one predicate so their counts add up

 @returns Whether any ballot was cast on it, which alone makes the round
 evidence about the producers on its slate

 @example
 ```ts
 const judged = roundWasJudged({ round, },);

/**
 Renders one seat's counts per slice, so a reader can bootstrap over slices.

 SLICES ARE THE INDEPENDENT UNIT, NOT BALLOTS. Every ballot in a round was
 cast over one slate and every round on a slice was cut from one passage, so
 the pooled share's ballot-level error understates how far a standing moves
 between runs: a four-slice standing moved one model from 52.2 to 26.7 to
 10.0 percent across identical runs. A bootstrap over whole slices needs each
 slice's counts, and the pooled table throws them away. These lines keep them
 in sample order, so each pairs with its slice progress line by position, and
 they carry votes, ballots and candidates rather than a share, for the reason
 the pooled line carries its denominator. They read the judged rounds alone,
 as the pooled table does, so the two count the same rounds.
