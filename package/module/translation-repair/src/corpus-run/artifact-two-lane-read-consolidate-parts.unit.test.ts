/**
 * Tests for the leaf shapes one consolidated slice is built from.
 *
 * WHY THE SHIPPED FIELD IS STRICT AND THE OTHERS ARE NOT. Every other field
 * here is evidence ABOUT a decision; `shipped` is the decision's OUTPUT, and a
 * consumer writes its text into the document. So the terminal and the shipped
 * kind are checked against each other rather than read independently. A record
 * disagreeing with itself about that would either ship a passage nobody settled
 * on or silently drop one that was, and both are wrong at the page rather than
 * in a report.
 *
 * FOUR CASES MAKE THAT A TABLE rather than a rule: consolidated-with-text and
 * unchanged-without are the two agreements, and the two crossings are the two
 * refusals. A check reading either field alone would accept all four.
 *
 * WHY THE BALLOT'S EVIDENCE FIELDS ARE CHOICES AND NOT PROSE. `#164` found the
 * gate shipping a rendering its own ballots named faultier, because nothing
 * counted them. A name outside the three would be counted as nothing and would
 * weaken that evidence silently, so the lists are parsed as names rather than
 * as strings.
 *
 * `artifact-two-lane-read-consolidate.ts` is the only caller, and it asks these
 * about whole valid artifacts. Every refusal here is a branch no valid fixture
 * reaches.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
