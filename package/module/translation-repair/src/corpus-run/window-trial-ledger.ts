//region Window trial ledger
// What a window trial has already bought, kept on disk as it is bought.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS. The window trial judges each flagged slice three times, roughly 1760 real
// exchanges. The slice cache does not help: it is keyed and read by the DOCUMENT
// DRIVER, and this trial calls the stage directly, so nothing resumes. A run
// that dies at hour three would otherwise restart from zero.
//
// ONE LINE PER COMPLETED ARM, appended the moment it completes rather than
// batched at the end, because the failure this guards against is the process
// not reaching the end.
//
// WHAT MAKES A LINE SKIPPABLE is the protocol it was bought under, not just
// which slice it describes. A trial re-run after the rosters, the corpus pin or
// the code generation moved is asking a different question, and resuming across
// that boundary would silently mix two experiments into one tally. That is the
// same defect the slice cache's generation marker exists to prevent, and it is
// worse here because the output is a measurement rather than a document.

 WHY AN APPEND HAS TO LOOK FIRST. A kill mid-append leaves text with no

 fragment: the line did not parse, so the row was lost and its arm bought
 again, and once a second row followed it the unreadable line was no longer
 the last and every later read of the ledger threw.

 A FRAGMENT IS REMOVED, by writing the ledger again without it. It recorded an
 arm that never completed, which is bought again whether the fragment stays
 or goes. A WHOLE LINE THAT LOST ONLY ITS NEWLINE is given one and keeps what
 it bought.
