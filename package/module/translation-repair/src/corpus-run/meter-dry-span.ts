//region Meter dry span
// Turns a series of meter readings into the two numbers that price a provider
// seat: how much of the time it was spendable, and the longest stretch it was
// not.
//
// EVERY OUTAGE IS REPORTED AS A RANGE, because the sampling is irregular by
// construction. A reading happens when a run asks for one, so two samples can
// be a minute apart or a day apart, and an outage seen at one sample and gone
// by the next started and ended somewhere in between. Reporting the gap
// between two dry samples as "the outage" understates it; reporting the gap
// between the surrounding wet samples overstates it. Both bounds are kept.
//
// ONLY `wet` PROVES RECOVERY AND ONLY `dry` PROVES OUTAGE. An `unreadable`
// meter proves neither, so it ends a CONFIRMED stretch, because the provider
// could have recovered and failed again behind it, while never closing the
// upper bound, which runs to the nearest sample that actually answered wet. Two
// confirmed stretches either side of an unreadable therefore share one upper
// bound covering the whole thing, which is what is really known.
//
// THE DENOMINATOR EXCLUDES UNREADABLE READINGS. A duty cycle is a fraction of
// the readings that answered; counting readings that did not would push the
// number toward whichever way the meter endpoint happened to fail.
//
// ABSENCE IS NAMED, never nullish: `'none'` for a missing neighbour, and
// `'no-outage'` for a provider no reading found out. `boundedByMs` is an
// optional property rather than a nullish one, which is the other accepted
// form in `doc/research/optionality-enforcement.md`.
