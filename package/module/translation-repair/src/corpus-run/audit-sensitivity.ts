//region Audit sensitivity
// Asks whether the rendering audit can detect a planted defect at all, and
// whether it invents one where there is none.
//
// THIS IS THE INSTRUMENT'S OWN GUARD TEST. Everything else about the audit is
// checked against scripted replies, which prove the code does what it says and
// prove nothing about what real auditors do with the prompt. Two arms are the
// least that can say anything: a rendering with one dropped negator, where a
// working instrument corroborates a defect, and a faithful rendering, where a
// working instrument corroborates none.
//
// THREE MEASUREMENTS PER ARM, KEPT APART, because a single count cannot say
// which part failed:
//
// -   ORACLE HITS, per voice: did this auditor point anywhere near the planted
//     defect, whatever it called the defect and whether or not anyone agreed.
//     This is about the AUDITORS.
// -   DROPPED CLAIMS, per voice: did an auditor point at it and fail to anchor.
//     This is about the PROMPT and the SCREEN.
// -   CORROBORATED, AGREED and NEAR MISSES: did the matcher bring two voices
//     together. This is about the MATCHER.
//
// A run that scores three oracle hits, zero drops and zero agreement of either
// tier is a matcher problem. One that scores zero oracle hits is not.
//
// `agreed` IS A SUPERSET OF `corroborated`, since exactly equal focus intervals
// trivially overlap. So `corroborated=1 agreed=1` is ONE defect reported at two
// strengths, not two findings, and `corroborated=0 agreed=1` is the loose tier
// catching what the strict one missed.
//
// Inputs live in `audit-sensitivity-input.ts` and are cat-themed invention. NO
// corpus text takes part.
//
// IT KEEPS ITS ANSWERS, which it did not always. Both arms ran three times on
// 2026-08-17 and the results existed only in the terminal that ran them, so
// nothing can now re-read them, and the instrument's stability across those
// runs cannot be checked by anyone. Every invocation now lands under
// `audit-sensitivity/` in the runs directory, carrying the roster and the
// pipeline digest that produced it. Standard output is unchanged.
//
// IT ONLY RUNS WHEN INVOKED, which it also did not always. Both arms used to
// execute at module scope, so anything that imported this file bought a full
// roster of calls by importing it. `coverage-probe.ts` has carried the guard
// against exactly that from the start; this file did not, and nothing but the
// bundler's entry list stood between an ordinary import and the spend.
