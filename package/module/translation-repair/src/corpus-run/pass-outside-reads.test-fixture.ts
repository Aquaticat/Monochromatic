/**
 Test-only outside reads for a preparation (ledger X19): nothing from the
 web and nothing from the pinned corpus, so a test that prepares an original
 naming a title or linking a page buys no search with the key the suite
 inherits from `mise`, writes no real cache, and does not depend on the
 corpus being checked out. A case that needs a reader to answer overrides
 that one reader by spreading this object.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
