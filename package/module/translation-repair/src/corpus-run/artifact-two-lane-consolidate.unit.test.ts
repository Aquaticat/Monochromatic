 * can settle six different ways and exactly one of them produces wording an
 * assembly should write; the other five leave the slice with whatever the lane
 * contest put there. A record that carried a bare text field per slice would
 * make those indistinguishable, and one of the five, `no-standing-text`,
 * carries the EMPTY STRING, so an assembly reading it naively would delete
 * every slice whose contest named neither lane.
 *
 * The named-absence half is therefore the half with teeth: these assert that a
 * settlement which changes nothing offers NO text to write, rather than
 * offering text that happens to match.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
