/**
 Tests for the store that resumes a settlement an earlier run bought.

 WHY THE SHAPE IS CHECKED AT ALL, and why more strictly than the contest
 store's: a settlement carries `text` that SHIPS. The record built from one
 hands that text to the assembly whenever the terminal says a consolidation
 won, so this store is the single path on which bytes read off disk become
 corpus text in an artifact. A file that was truncated, hand-edited, or
 written by a different schema would carry them there with nothing else in the
 way. Refusing it costs one re-asked slice.

 THE ABSENT GATE IS THE CASE MOST LIKELY TO BE BROKEN BY A STRICTER GUARD, so
 it is pinned here: a slice the validity floor stopped never reached the gate,
 and a store that required the key would refuse every floored slice and
 re-buy it every run.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention written into throwaway directories.
