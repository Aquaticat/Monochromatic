/**
 Tests for naming the one built pipeline a draw's pool was settled under.

 THE FUNCTION IS KEYED ON THE KEPT NAMES, NOT ON THE LOOKUP, and that is the
 property most worth pinning. `EligibleEntries.digestByEntry` answers for every
 entry the pool ADMITTED, while a draw keeps a subset of those; reading the
 lookup's values directly would let an entry the draw never touched decide the
 pool's generation, or turn a clean single-generation draw into the
 two-generation refusal the "REFUSES a pool spanning two builds" case pins.
 Every case here therefore hands over a lookup wider than the kept names.

 THE LOOKUP KEYS ENTRY IDS AND THE DRAW KEEPS FILE NAMES. This file's
 fixtures used to key the lookup by file name too, agreeing with a lookup
 that read the kept name as it came, while the real lookup keys the census's
 entry ids; so every real draw's manifest recorded no generation at all
 (ledger B63). The fixtures now key by entry id, and one case drives the
 real census.

 THE COUNT AND THE DIGEST ARE COUNTED OVER DIFFERENT SETS, deliberately. The
 digest comes from kept entries that recorded one, and `entries` comes from
 every kept name. A pool where half the artifacts predate digest recording
 still has one generation and still offered the sample its full width, so
 collapsing the two counts would understate the pool a graded sheet was drawn
 from. A manifest that recorded no generation is the gap this closes, and that
 asymmetry is the closing.
