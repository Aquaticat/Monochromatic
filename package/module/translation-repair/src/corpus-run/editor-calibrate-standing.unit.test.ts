/**
 Tests for one seat's rendered standing.

 THE REPORT IS LINES, NOT PRINTS, so these cases read it without capturing
 the console. What they pin: a seat with no rounds says so instead of
 rendering an empty table, a seat with rounds renders its standings and then
 its coverage gaps with the answered-but-unslated state kept apart from the
 silent one, and `slatedAuthors` names every stakeholder of every slate in
 slate order, composites included.

 Fixtures are model ids and ballots, so there is no passage here to invent.
