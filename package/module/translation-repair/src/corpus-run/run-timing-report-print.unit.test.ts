/**
 Tests for what the run timing report prints, one printer at a time.

 EACH PRINTER IS HANDED THE READING IT PRINTS, so a case states the whole
 reading and asserts the whole text it produced. The span is checked in each of
 its three units, since the same report reads a six-hour pass and a
 thirty-second probe and a probe printed in hours reads as a run that did
 nothing.

 THE ROUND TIME SHARE IS CHECKED AT ZERO. Rounds that all took no time leave
 nothing to divide the grace by, and a percentage of nothing reads as a
 measurement.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
