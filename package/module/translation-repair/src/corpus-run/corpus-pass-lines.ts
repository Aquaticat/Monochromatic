 Lines saying which entries a pass was restricted to.

 WHAT `--only` BYPASSES IS THE CHOICE, NOT THE ORDER. Unrestricted, the pass
 runs every pending pair at the pin; restricted, it runs the entries the
 operator named (`corpus-pass-select.ts`), and those still pending run in the
 pass's own order, cached progress first and then the size bands by rank
 (`corpus-pass-order.ts`). Until 2026-10-06 the line said the ordering was
 bypassed.

 A NAMED ENTRY FINISHED BEFORE DOES NOT RUN, so the line says the named
 entries run only if still pending; it is printed before the selection reads
 which of them are, and until 2026-10-10 it said every named entry runs.

 @param onlyIds - entry ids the command line named, empty when it named none
