//
// SPENDS NOTHING. The rows were bought once; every question anyone asks of them
// afterwards should be free, or it will not get asked twice.
//
// READS THE NEWEST RUN by default, because these probes accumulate on purpose:
// the store keeps every run so a verdict can be compared against the one it was
// bought to be compared against, and a reader that silently merged them would
// undo that.
//
// `--against <run>` PAIRS TWO RUNS subject by subject, which is the only way to
// state the spread this instrument moves through on unchanged input. Without
// it, the archive-versus-fresh comparison is a difference with no scale to read
// it against.
