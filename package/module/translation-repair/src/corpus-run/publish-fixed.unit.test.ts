/**
 Tests for publishing one settled entry as a page in the mirrored corpus tree.
 
 DRIVEN THROUGH THE REAL ASSEMBLER, `spliceSlices`, rather than a stub of it.
 The publisher's whole job is to put the deciders' answers back where they
 came from, and every way of getting that wrong lives in the join between a
 reading and the span it belongs to: an index read positionally, an offset
 recovered by searching for text, a slice written twice. A fixture assembler
 would agree with whatever the publisher did.
 
 THE ARCHIVE HERE IS A WHOLE LITTLE DOCUMENT, not one paragraph, because the
 property that matters most is what the publisher does NOT touch. A page
 assembled correctly is byte-identical outside the slices that were replaced,
 and only text either side of a replaced span can show that.
 
 THE TWO PURE SUBJECTS LIVE IN `publish-fixed-replacements.unit.test.ts`, apart
 from these. A file is abandoned once any describe in it fails, so while they
 shared one, a break in the replacement builder left every case here unrun and
 unreported: the runner named one narrow failure where the real blast radius
 was every page the pass writes.
 
 ONE CASE PROVES A BRANCH THE CORPUS CANNOT REACH. No slice in any settled
 artifact on disk carries an archive that holds no wording, 249 of 249 at the
 last count, so the silent readings are unreachable there and a measurement
 over real output can only report zero. Whether the publisher does the right
 thing when a decider ships nothing into a passage the original speaks is
 therefore settled here, by a fixture built to be in that state.
 
 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
