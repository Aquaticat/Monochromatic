//region Draw outputs
// The lifetime of the files one draw writes.
//
// A draw produces three outputs that must exist together to mean anything: the
// detection sheet, the repair sheet, and the manifest joining sheet positions
// back to issue ids. They are written one after another, and a FINAL path is
// refused once it exists, which is what protects graded work from a repeated
// draw.
//
// Those two facts combine badly on failure. A fault between writes leaves a
// partial set, and the refusal then blocks the next draw on files nobody ever
// graded. Removing what the failed invocation created is what returns the
// directory to a state a draw can be retried from, and it can never remove
// graded work, because a graded sheet is one an earlier invocation committed.
//
// TRACKING IS FOR FINAL DRAWS ONLY, and that is a correctness requirement
// rather than an optimization. A final output is created with `wx`, so its path
// did not exist a moment earlier and removing it can only remove what this
// invocation made. A preliminary output is written with `w`, which REPLACES
// whatever was there, so removing one on failure would delete a file this
// invocation never created. Preliminary draws need no protection anyway: they
// carry no overwrite guard, so a partial one is replaced by the next draw
// rather than blocking it.
//
// Paths are recorded BEFORE their write, not after. A write can create or
// truncate a file and then fail, and a path recorded only on success would
// leave exactly that file behind. The one failure that created nothing is the
// exclusive create finding the path taken (two draws racing, or a link left
// at the path): that path is released, so the file standing there, which no
// draw of this invocation made, is not removed with the rest.
