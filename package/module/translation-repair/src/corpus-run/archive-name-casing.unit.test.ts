/**
 Guards class one hundred thirty-six (hulicaijia20, 2026-09-25): the archive
 writes a place's name title case every time it names it mid-sentence, in
 the body and again in a picture caption, and the bench wrote the same name
 with its later words in lower case on another line of the page, so the
 page carried one place under two casings. The archive's title-case form is
 restored where a shipped slice writes the name's first word as the archive
 does and a later word in another case. Cat-themed invention throughout; no
 corpus content appears here.
