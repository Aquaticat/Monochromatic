// off disk become corpus text in an artifact, and a file that was corrupted,
// hand-edited, or written by a different schema would carry them there with
// nothing else in the way. Refusing it costs one re-asked slice.

 what that gate ships: `gate-kept-standing` where it ships the standing text,

 the two alike, `wrap-erased-difference`.

 ABSENT IS VALID and is not the same as empty. A slice the floor stopped never

 a store that required the key would refuse every floored slice. Whether
 absence is right for the settlement in hand is `gateFitsTerminal`'s question.

 THE CHOICE IS RECOMPUTED FROM THE BALLOTS. The stage settles `choice` with
 `settleGateBallots` over the ballots it stores and rewrites only `ships`
 afterwards, so a stored choice its own ballots do not give was not written by
 the stage. `choice` and `ships` are not compared: a forfeit standing ships
 the consolidation over a standing or neither choice.
