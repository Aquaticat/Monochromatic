/**
 Tests for the words the dropped-destination refusal writes.

 WHAT THESE PIN: the refusal says how many destinations the page would drop
 and which slices carry them in the words of that count, one form at exactly
 one and the other at any other count, and says where a destination outside
 every slice sits.

 Fixtures are invented slice numbers about a bookshop cat, so there is no
 corpus text here.
