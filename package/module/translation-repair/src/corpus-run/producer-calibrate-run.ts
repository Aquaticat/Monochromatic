//region Producer calibrate run
// WHICH OF THE ROSTER SHOULD WRITE, measured rather than assumed.
//
// The roster carries nine models (eight when this was written) and the writers
// stay at three. `roster-bench.ts`
// answered the question about WIDTH and found it changes nothing; this answers
// the question about WHO, which that bench was never shaped to ask.
//
// EVERY MODEL WRITES ON EVERY SLICE. A narrow slate would only ever compare the
// models that happened to be seated, and the head-of-roster seating the width
// bench uses would compare the first three against nothing. Running the whole
// roster against the same passage is the only shape where a standing means the same
// thing for each of them.
//
// EVERY MODEL ALSO JUDGES, matching production, and the standing then throws
// away each model's ballots on its own work. That is `producer-standing.ts`'s
// whole argument: counting self-votes would rank the most self-confident model
// first rather than the best-written one.
//
// ONE PASS PER SLICE. The sample size is the SLICE COUNT, not a repeat count,
// and the counts are reported beside every rate so a reader can see how much
// weight one leads by. A gap smaller than its own denominator supports is not
// a gap.
//
// WHO IS MISSING FROM THE TABLE IS REPORTED TOO. `producerStandings` carries a
// row only for a model somebody voted on, so a model its provider refused for
// budget simply vanishes, and an absent row reads exactly like a model that
// wrote and lost. This runner seated the writers on a day one of the two
// providers was empty. `producer-silence.ts` splits the seats three ways and
// names both silent groups; the slates are what tell them apart, which is why
// every round's authors are carried beside its ballots.
//
// SPENDS QUOTA, roughly twenty calls per slice before any re-ask. Point
// `TRANSLATION_REPAIR_RUNS_DIR` at a throwaway directory.
