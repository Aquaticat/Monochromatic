//
// `translate-slice.unit.test.ts` and `window-trial-slice.unit.test.ts` both pin
// the forwarding against a synthetic client, which proves the code path exists
// and is wired. Neither can prove that in THIS run, with this roster and this
// prompt renderer, the label went out on the wire. A wide arm that quietly
// judged narrow evidence would not fail; it would return a clean null, and a
// clean null is exactly what the trial is trying to distinguish from a real one.
//
// So the run watches its own first purchase, then stops watching. The cost is
// one wrapper and a few kilobytes of retained sheets.
