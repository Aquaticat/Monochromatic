//region Probe relabel
// Asks the introduced-defect probe about regions a HUMAN read as damaged, three
// times each: under the disclosure production sends, under the other prompt,
// and with no accepted issue known at all.
//
// The cat fixtures established that the probe reports damage 3/3 on a deleted
// clause the source supports, loses one voice of three when a false accepted
// issue names that clause, and stays correctly silent when the deletion really
// is licensed. So the instrument works and the labelling effect is modest,
// which leaves the corpus result unexplained: 2438 of 2571 prober verdicts
// found nothing, including on every one of these regions.
//
// The first run answered that: withholding the list took the damaged regions
// from 0 of 15 prober verdicts raising anything to 7 of 15, with every region
// drawing at least one admissible claim. The fixture understated the effect
// because it carried ONE prior issue and these regions carry six to seventeen.
//
// That run was made while the probe still rendered the list by default.
// Production has since withheld it and moved the excusing to the screen
// (`introduced-defect-wire.ts`), and for a while the two arms here relied on
// that default, so both sent the same prompt and differed only in the screen,
// under labels that said otherwise. Every arm now names its
// disclosure, and the third arm, no list at all, separates the screen's effect
// from the prompt's.
//
// That alone proves nothing, which is why the control arm exists. Every damaged
// region is damaged by construction, so no claim raised there could be wrong,
// and an unlabelled prober reporting the PRE-EXISTING defect would look exactly
// like one finding the damage. Regions from the same entries that the reader did
// NOT flag separate the two: a withheld arm equally loud there is re-reporting
// old defects and the finding collapses.
//
// Reads corpus text through git at the pinned commit and writes nothing.
