/**
 * Tests for saying whether audited wording is wording a document would carry.
 *
 * THE ORDER OF THE BRANCHES IS THE SUBJECT, not an implementation detail. On an
 * artifact no stage has decided, every would-ship reading names the archive, so
 * a classifier that compared text before asking whether a decision exists would
 * report a displacement on all 227 of the population's undecided subjects. That
 * is the exact wrong answer this module was built to avoid, and it is pinned
 * first.
 *
 * THE PERSISTED READER IS TESTED AGAINST ABSENCE. Rows come off disk through an
 * unchecked cast, so `unrecorded` is reachable in production and reading a
 * missing field as `survives` would assert the strongest claim here from no
 * evidence at all.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
