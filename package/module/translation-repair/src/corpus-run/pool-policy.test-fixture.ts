// so a case says which policy it pools under rather than inheriting whatever
// the shell running the suite exported.
//
// AND THE TWO REQUESTS THAT CONTRADICT EACH OTHER, as a built command's child
// is handed them and as the pool refuses them, for the as-built case of each
// command that pools.
