/**
 Reads both sides of one entry at the pin.

 A PAGE ABSENT AT A COMMIT THE CLONE HOLDS IS SKIPPED AND LOGGED rather than
 thrown, since an entry with only one side is an ordinary state of this
 corpus. Every other failure propagates: until 2026-10-06 every failed read
 was skipped, so a clone git could not open or a commit the clone lacks read
 as every entry having one side.

 @param pin - corpus clone and commit the reads resolve against

 @param entryId - entry to read

 @param log - logger the skip is written to

 @returns Both texts, or `missing` when either page is absent at the pin

 @throws {@link CorpusReadError} for any read failure other than a page
 absent at a commit the clone holds

 @example
 ```ts
 const texts = await readPair({ pin, entryId: 'Mittens', log, },);
