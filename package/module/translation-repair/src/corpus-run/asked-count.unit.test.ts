/**
 Tests for reading how many units a bench or calibration was asked for.
 
 THE REFUSAL IS THE POINT, and it replaced four copies of a silent fallback.
 `editor-calibrate`, `producer-calibrate`, `roster-bench` and
 `editor-width-probe` each spelled this `Number(process.argv[2] ?? default)`
 and none checked the result. `Number('fourty')` is `NaN`, and
 `pickSpreadSample` with a count of `NaN` returns nothing, measured: `count
 NaN -> picked 0`. So a typo ran the whole calibration over an empty sample,
 printed its roster and its totals, and exited zero.
 
 WHY REFUSING BEATS FALLING BACK. A fallback also hides the typo, and it
 spends a roster while hiding it. The operator who typed `fourty` wanted forty
 slices, and would read a clean six-slice default as the forty they asked for.
 
 ZERO IS REFUSED, WHICH THE AUDIT'S `--cap 0` IS NOT. That cap reads a whole
 archive and buys nothing, which is a real use. A bench over zero slices asks
 nobody anything, so there is nothing for it to mean.
