//region Preparation rebuilt from a settled artifact
// Carving a document pair the way the run that settled it carved it.
//
// WHY A REBUILD EXISTS. The pass carves through the roster shell, whose section
// round and block rounds move slices the deterministic aligner would place
// elsewhere, and the caches that held those answers retire at settlement. An
// instrument that calls the bare `prepareDocumentPair` over the corpus is
// therefore measuring a pipeline that no longer runs. The artifact records
// both halves of the pairing recipe, and this is the one place they are
// turned back into the map and list `prepareDocumentPair` consumed.
//
// A GAP IS NAMED, NOT PAPERED OVER. An artifact written before a recipe half
// existed rebuilds with the deterministic default for that half, and says so.
// Whether that default was what the run actually used is then a question the
// identity check answers: a match proves the slicing is reproduced, and a
// mismatch beside a named gap is not evidence that the slicing moved.
//
// A COMPLETE RECIPE IS NOT A REPRODUCTION (ledger A12). The slicer that reads
// the recipe changes too: class one hundred twelve (`a43c5d88d`) reads an
// interior gap unplaced on both sides as one merge, and mikaela15, settled at
// the commit before it, rebuilt to 32 of its recorded 34 slices with an empty
// gap list. And the artifact records the carve after the pass folded carried
// passages into their carriers, while nothing records the fold (TianqiChen66614
// rebuilds with slices 13 and 14 moved). So the rebuild compares its carve with
// the rows the run recorded and says where it departs
// (`artifact-two-lane-rebuild-rows.ts` says why rows rather than identity).
//
// A RECIPE THAT DOES NOT FIT ITS TEXT IS A MOVED CARVE, NOT A CRASH. The
// recorded block pairing names blocks by index, and the text the rebuild
// carves can parse into fewer blocks than the run's did: an artifact that
// predates storing its archive is carved over the corpus copy, and a parser
// change moves block boundaries. `blockPairingToSteps` refuses a pair naming a
// block its section lacks, and the rebuild answers `moved` in that refusal's
// words, so a republish leaves the page and says why, and the instruments
// that walk every settled artifact (`carveSettled`, the rendering audit) go on
// to the next one instead of stopping on this one.

 CARVES OVER THE ARCHIVE THE ARTIFACT STORED (ledger A18). A pass reshapes
 the archive before it carves (`passArchiveText`, a heading relabel,

 corpus copy at the artifact's commit is carved only for an artifact written
 before that text was stored. Carving the corpus copy read 23 of 77 stored
 carves as moved that the stored archive reproduces, and left shihai4h's
 republished page 9 characters short.

 A RECORDED BLOCK PAIRING THAT NAMES A BLOCK THE TEXT LACKS is refused while
 the carve converts it, and the artifact is then carved again as one that
 records no block pairing: every section's blocks by the deterministic
 aligner, not only the refused section's. The refusal names the block and the
 count, not the section, and a pairing that does not fit one section's blocks
 says the text parsed otherwise than the run's, which makes the pairings that
 still fit by count no better evidence of the run's blocks.
