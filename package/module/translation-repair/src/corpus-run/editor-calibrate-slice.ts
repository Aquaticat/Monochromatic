// SPLIT OUT OF `editor-calibrate.ts` when the overlap dial (`#213`) put that
// file over its line budget. The type moved with the line because the line is
// its only reader outside the driver, and the driver is an entry module:
// nothing an entry module declares may be exported through a barrel, since
// rolldown folds the export into a shared chunk and `import.meta.main` reads
// false in the built command. A line that is to be tested has to live beside
// the driver, not inside it.
