/**
 * Tests for the blind sheet that decides whether the probe finds damage or
 * invents it.
 *
 * THE SHEET AND ITS MANIFEST ARE WRITTEN BY TWO FUNCTIONS THAT EACH SORT, and
 * everything the measurement produces rests on those two sorts agreeing. The
 * sheet numbers its items and the manifest numbers its rows, and a scorer reads
 * a grade off position N of one and attributes it to position N of the other.
 * If the orders ever diverged, every grade would land on the wrong item and the
 * result would still look like a clean measurement. The agreement case below is
 * the one that matters most in this file.
 *
 * THE BLINDNESS IS THE OTHER HALF. `kind` says which partition an item came
 * from, and a grader who can see it is answering a different question. It rides
 * in the manifest and must never reach the sheet, so one case searches the whole
 * rendered sheet for both partition names.
 *
 * ORDER IS BY DIGEST OF IDENTITY, WHICH IS NOT A DETAIL. Insertion order would
 * leak the partition whenever the caller built one partition before the other,
 * which is how both callers build them.
 *
 * FIXTURES ARE INVENTED AND CAT-THEMED. The real sheet quotes unlicensed corpus
 * text and is written outside the repository; nothing resembling it belongs in a
 * committed test.
