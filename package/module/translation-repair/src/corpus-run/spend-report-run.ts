 Reads named logs and reports what the run they describe cost.

 Returns nothing: the report on stdout IS the output.

 @param line - the report's command line, read whole by `reportingRefusals`,
 which refuses it when no log is named: any log a pass, probe or calibration
 wrote will do, and passing several totals them as one run

 @example
 ```ts
 await reportSpendCost({ line, },);
 ```
