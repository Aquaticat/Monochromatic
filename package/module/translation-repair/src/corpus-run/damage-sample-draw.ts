 Identity domain for this draw, so its digests can never collide with the

 BUMPED WITH THE POPULATION. Version 1 drew envelopes out of a top-level issue

 different populations addressed by different identities, so sharing a domain
 would let a version 1 sheet and a version 2 sheet claim the same draw.

 Separator between fields of a digest input.

 NUL because it cannot occur in a domain, seed, entry id or envelope id, so no
 combination of those fields can reproduce another combination's digest input
 and collide with it.

 Spelled as an escape rather than written as a literal byte. A raw NUL makes
 git record the whole file as binary, so every diff of it reads
 `Binary files differ` and every `rg` search skips it unless asked for
 `--text`. Both were observed on this file before this constant existed.

/**
 Turns one drawn region into the case a sheet item is built from.

 NO CORPUS READ AND NO RE-SLICING, unlike the version 1 path. The delivery row
 already carries the original passage and the wording that was there before, as
 the judges saw them, and the settled audit established that re-sliced text is a different
 input from the one that was judged. That also removes a failure mode rather
 than moving it: the old builder could draw a region and then fail to place it
 again, quietly shortening the sheet.

 THE WHOLE SLICE IS THE REGION here, because version 2 delivers by slice rather
 than by envelope, so the wording that was there before and the baseline the
 probe reads are the same text.
