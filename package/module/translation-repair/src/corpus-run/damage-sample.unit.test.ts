/**
 Boundary test for the damage sample command.

 The command reads every settled artifact of a runs directory and asks the
 roster about each region it draws, so what is checked here is what only the
 built command can show with no provider key in its environment: what it
 prints and exits with before any call. Its procedures have their own suites.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
