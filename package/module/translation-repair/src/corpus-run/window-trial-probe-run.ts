//region Window trial probe run
// The window trial, run end to end: does showing the judges the neighbouring original
// change how often the archive's English is replaced? Moved out of
// `window-trial-probe.ts`, which keeps the wiring.
//
// SPENDS QUOTA when the client it is given reaches a provider, roughly three
// judgings plus one slate per drawn slice. Everything the process owns arrives
// as an argument: the runs directory, the head the protocol digest is of, the
// client (built only where the walk begins, so a refusal to build one comes
// after the ledger read as it always did), the corpus and the buyer of one slice.
//
// EVERY PART OF THE READING IS TESTED WITHOUT QUOTA and lives elsewhere: the
// ledger, the draw, the per-slice arms and the report each have their own file
// and their own tests. What is here is composition and the corpus walk.
