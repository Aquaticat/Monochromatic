 Checks what the command line asked for against the reviewed references, and

 THE OPERATOR'S TO MEND, SO STATED. The inputs `reviewedFidelityRequest`
 checks are ones the operator typed or set: an entry filter, `--context`, the
 cap, the judges named, the damage families, and the corpus pin the
 environment can move. `FidelityReferenceError` is a fault elsewhere, where a
 reference read from the clone fails its reviewed hashes, so it is restated
 here, at the one site where it is the operator's, with its own sentence and
 itself as the cause. Until 2026-10-10 it printed as a fault of the command at
 exit 5, under frames (ledger B382). One refusal under the same operation is
 not the operator's: an empty checked-in manifest, or one repeating an id,
 which `selectReviewedFidelitySpecs` refuses as well and this restates too.

 @param request - what `reviewedFidelityRequest` checks

 @returns The selected reviewed specifications

 @throws StatedRefusalError when the request is refused, its sentence the

 Runs only source-reviewed, hash-locked comparisons through the production
 selector. Individual ballots are retained; a singleton judge's underweight
 merged verdict is not a quality score. This never changes role admission itself.

 @param line - the probe's command line, read whole by `reportingRefusals`

 @param pin - corpus commit and clone the reviewed references are read at

 @param readReferences - reads the selected references out of the pinned clone,
 which is the one step that touches the corpus

 @param resolveRuns - names the runs directory, called only once a run has
 something to keep, so a request that is refused or a zero cap needs none

 @param newClient - builds the client the judges are asked through, called only
 after the plan is on disk so a refused request needs no key

 @param now - the clock, read for the start and for the finish

 @param pipelineDigest - digest of the built output, read when the process started

 @param runnerClosure - chunks the executing entry imports, read when the process started

 @param perCallTimeoutMs - deadline of every exchange

 @param log - progress and diagnostic logger

 @param out - where the rows document is written

 @throws {@link FidelityReferenceError} for reference drift in what the clone holds

 @throws StatedRefusalError when the command line asks for something the probe does not run, or
 for a request the reviewed references refuse
