/**
 * Tests for the reader that turns recorded critic attribution into rates.
 *
 * Built alongside the writer on purpose. This pipeline's recurring failure is
 * telemetry that is recorded and never read, and a data path with no reader is
 * indistinguishable from one that was never built. These cases guard the two
 * ways a reader can quietly lie about a population.
 *
 * The first is mixing eligibility with silence. An entry settled before
 * attribution existed records no proposer for a claim its critics did raise, so
 * averaging it in understates every critic at once, and "this critic raised
 * nothing" becomes unreadable against "this entry could not have recorded it".
 *
 * The second is conflating self-repetition with agreement. One critic saying a
 * thing twice and two critics saying it once produce the same claim, and the
 * whole point of `#65` is which of those a duplicate came from.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention.
