/**
 Tests for checking a version 2 artifact's measurements against a
 preparation.

 WHAT THESE PIN is the boundary the standalone reader has to leave open. That
 reader checks the recorded preparation identity for SYNTAX and nothing more,
 because the inputs the identity hashes are not in the file; these cases run
 the same artifact against a preparation somebody rebuilt, and read its
 recorded measurements against it, as the rendering audit does. They tested an
 identity check nothing called until 2026-09-29 (ledger B30), and the
 measurements check the audit runs had no case of its own.
 
 The preparation here is a REAL one from `prepareDocumentPair` rather than a
 hand-built stand-in, so the identity, the slices and every measurement come
 from the same code a corpus pass runs.
 
 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
