// WHY THIS IS SEPARATE FROM THE SIZE SCREEN. `displacement-class.ts` reads
// character counts and nothing else, which is what makes it cheap and what makes
// it honest about its limits. This is a TEXT signal, and it answers a question
// size cannot: two of the relocation candidates the size screen produced were
// verified by hand as transcriptions, where the original embeds an image and the
// translation embeds the same image plus a reading of what it holds. The surplus
// is real, the neighbour's deficit is real, and they have nothing to do with
// each other.

 * Whether a slice embeds the same media on both sides.

 * A MARKER ON BOTH SIDES IS THE SIGNAL, not one on either. Media present only in

 * in the original is something the translation dropped. It is the SAME component
 * on both sides, with more prose beside it on one, that says the prose was read
 * out of the picture.
 *
 * ONE SLICE MATCHING IS A SUSPICION, NOT A VERDICT. A translator may embed an
 * image and independently move a passage across the same boundary. What this
 * earns is a hand-check before the candidate is counted as relocation.
