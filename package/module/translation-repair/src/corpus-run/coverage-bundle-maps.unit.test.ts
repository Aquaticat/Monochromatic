/**
 Tests for how the coverage census splits a build's bundles by their source
 maps (ledger T8). A bundle of import and export statements alone gets no
 map from rolldown, as the package's `index.mjs` has since 2026-09-29, and
 the census refused the whole build over it; a build with no map at all is
 the normal build, which the census still refuses, and so is a minified
 build, whose folded guards would read as run (ledger M79). Names are
 cat-themed invention.
