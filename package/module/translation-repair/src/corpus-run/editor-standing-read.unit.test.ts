/**
 Tests for which files `editor-standing-read` counts as artifacts.

 RUN AS AN OPERATOR RUNS IT, since the module exports nothing to call
 directly: every case writes a throwaway archive, runs the built command over
 it, and reads the summary line.

 AN ARTIFACT IS A REGULAR FILE. The census and the scheduler list only regular
 files named `*.json`, and this reader took every such NAME, so a directory
 called `Tabby.json` was read as JSON and reported refused, and a symlink was
 followed to whatever it named and counted a second time (ledger B64). The
 command lists two layouts, an archive's own `artifacts/` directory and an
 archive that is itself the artifacts directory, so each layout has a case.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
