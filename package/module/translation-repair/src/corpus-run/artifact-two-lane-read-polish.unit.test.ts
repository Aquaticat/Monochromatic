/**
 Tests generation-six final body polish artifact reader and the gate reader
 it calls: every not-run reason, a changed and an unchanged polish against
 each shipping role its gate may record, an unchanged polish with no gate,
 a naturalness review bound to the text the polish ships, ballot names
 narrowed to polish choices, and each refusal checked by the path and reason
 its message carries, so a case refused by another check fails. Texts and
 model ids are cat-themed invention.
