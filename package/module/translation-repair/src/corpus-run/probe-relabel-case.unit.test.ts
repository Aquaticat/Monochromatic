/**
 Tests for finding the slice a recorded replacement was made in.

 THE PROBE RE-CARVES WHAT THE RUN CARVED, which is the only reason this
 function exists: a relabelling asks a fresh reader about a region production
 already edited, and if the re-carve landed on different text the reader would
 be answering about a passage production never sent. So the lookup is by TEXT
 rather than by index, and the two returned halves must come from ONE slice.
 A function that returned the whole document for both would satisfy a
 careless test and quietly widen every prompt the probe sends.

 THE REFUSAL IS A SECURITY BOUNDARY, not just a diagnostic.
 `ArtifactParseError` carries `messageNamesOnly`, which `reportingRefusals`
 reads as permission to print the whole message, and the marker's justification
 is that the class "names the artifact path and the shape the value failed to
 satisfy, and quotes neither the value nor the file". Until 2026-08-25 this
 site put 80 characters of the replaced TRANSLATION into that path, so a probe
 that could not find its slice printed a memorial page's wording to a terminal
 and into the run's log. Sweeping the package found it was the only one of 47
 interpolating paths that quoted text rather than a structural position. The
 "REFUSES to quote the text it could not find" case is that guard, and it is the reason this file is worth its length.

 FIXTURES ARE INVENTED AND CAT-THEMED, in Simplified Chinese against English,
 because the real inputs are unlicensed corpus pages. The runs directory and
 the artifact file are process-wide, so every case here runs at
 `concurrency: 1` and puts its own back.
