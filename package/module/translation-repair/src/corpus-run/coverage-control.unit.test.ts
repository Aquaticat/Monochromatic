//region Coverage control cut
// What the absence control actually deletes.
//
// The control asks the coverage roster about a passage, deletes the spans it
// anchored on, and asks again. Everything the control concludes rests on the
// deletion being real: a cut that returned the document unchanged would let a
// wire that cannot see absence pass, and a cut that returned blank on
// everything would report a working wire as unmeasurable.
//
// Fixtures are invented cat prose, never corpus text.
