/**
 Tests for the resume guard that keeps one accumulation at one built pipeline.

 The failure these exist for was measured, not imagined. One accumulation
 directory held 22 settled entries across FOUR generations. None of the four
 was a decision: the pass stops at its soft budget, a fresh invocation resumes
 it, and that invocation builds again. Four resumes across an evening of
 ordinary commits produced four generations, and every reader that computes a
 rate then refuses the whole pool.

 THE HALVES ARE CALLED AS THE PASS CALLS THEM (ledger B30): the placement
 census first, and the build check over what it returns. A wrapper running
 both was tested here in their place while the pass ran a schema check
 between them and never called it.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
