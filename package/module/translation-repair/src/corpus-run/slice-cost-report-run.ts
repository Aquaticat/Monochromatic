//region Slice cost report run
// Reads the per-slice cost telemetry a pass writes, and answers the one
// question it was written for: whether a slice's cost scales with its size.
//
// WHY IT EXISTS AT ALL: `slice-cost-log.ts` writes a line per slice per lane and
// `slice-cost-read.ts` parses them back, and until now NOTHING CALLED THE
// READER. Telemetry written and never read is a failure this package has named
// before, and it is worse than no telemetry, because it looks like the question
// is covered.
//
// THE QUESTION. The two-lane cost measurement of 2026-08-17 found that
// per-slice cost FALLS as entries get larger,
// 7.07 minutes a slice on the smallest entry against 2.47 on the largest, and
// could not say why. Two explanations fit that equally: larger entries have
// larger slices and size is what costs, or cost is mostly a fixed per-slice
// overhead that a larger entry amortises over more content. They imply opposite
// remedies. If size dominates, slicing differently changes the bill; if overhead
// dominates, only asking fewer times does.
//
// THE READING THAT SEPARATES THEM is cost per CHARACTER against slice size. Under
// a size-dominated cost that figure is flat; under a fixed overhead it falls
// steeply as slices grow, because the same overhead is divided by more
// characters.
//
// COSTS NOTHING. It reads a log file and prints.
