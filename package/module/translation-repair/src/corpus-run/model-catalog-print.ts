// This exists because the drift has already happened and cost silently. Two ids
// were removed on 2026-08-05 after both began answering HTTP 404 "is no longer
// supported", and 404 is not in the transient retry set, so every stage holding
// one of them lost a voice per call and nothing said why. The catalog comment
// records facts "verified live on 2026-07-16", and a hand-verified note is
// exactly the kind of claim that rots without announcing it.
//
// It also answers a roster question that cannot be answered from the catalog
// alone: whether any model exists that holds NO role in a run. Critics, panel
// and judges are all the same six, so no judge is independent of the issue it
// would judge, and a genuinely independent judge needs a model the run does not
// already use.
//
// Read-only. Prints ids and nothing else: the key is never rendered.
