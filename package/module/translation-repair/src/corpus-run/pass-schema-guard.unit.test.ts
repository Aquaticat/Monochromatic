/**
 Tests for the resume guard that keeps one accumulation at one artifact shape.

 WHAT THIS EXISTS FOR is one narrow case, and the tests say which. The
 pipeline guard already refuses an ordinary mixed-generation resume, because a
 build writing one artifact shape cannot share a digest with a build writing
 another. Its drift opt-in is what lets a mixed directory through, on a promise
 that a rate over the pool stays usable once it names a required commit. That
 promise holds across BUILDS and not across SHAPES: a version 1 artifact
 cannot answer a two-lane question at any commit.

 AND ONE CASE THE FIRST VERSION MISSED, which an independent review found: the
 guard read the version LABEL and never the body, so a version 1 artifact
 relabelled as the generation this pass writes passed it.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
