// THE PICTURE READINGS' PER-PICTURE HOOK (ledger X12), beside the lane
// contest's (`pass-contest-reseat.ts`), so a test can drive it with the
// reading rig the other phases' hooks are tested with.
//
// THE READINGS READ THEIR READERS ONCE PER CALL: a dry-out between two
// pictures left every later picture on the readers read before it. Holds
// began after the pictures reading 11 times in 3 of 4,122 run logs (measured
// 2026-09-28, an upper bound: the census counts the preparation stages that
// follow the readings under the same reading). The hook now re-reads the
// readers while a hold runs, waiting it out where the readers cannot reach
// quorum, and keeps handing them over once it has ended
// (`pass-reseat-hook.ts`).
