// REGULAR FILE named `<entry id>.json` in an artifacts directory. Each reader
// used to read that for itself, filtering names by `.json` and slicing the
// suffix off, and two of them (settled-carve.ts and the rendering audit's run
// sets) skipped the regular-file check the census and the scheduler apply, so
// a directory or a symlink named like an artifact became a settled entry
// there (ledger B64). The suffix is a type as well as a check: a name that
// passed `isArtifactFileName` carries it, and `entryIdOfArtifact` takes only
// such a name, so no reader slices a name that lacks it.
