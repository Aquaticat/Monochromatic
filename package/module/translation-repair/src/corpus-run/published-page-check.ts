//region Published page check
// Reads the DELIVERABLE back, which until now nothing did.
//
// `#175` made the mirrored tree of fixed `*.en.md` pages the thing this pipeline
// produces, and every check built since reads artifacts instead. An artifact is
// what the deciders said; a page is what a reader gets. `#194` is what the gap
// between them costs: the publisher turned a named absence back into the empty
// string, and the only thing that noticed was a guard inside the splice, after
// four hours and forty-eight minutes of calls.
//
// NOTHING HERE PRINTS A PASSAGE. Every finding names a slice by index and a size
// by character count, because these reports are read beside a corpus whose text
// may not leave the run directory.
//
// WHAT THIS CANNOT CHECK, stated so nobody reads more into a clean report than
// it carries. The exact check is to splice the artifact's readings over its
// archive text and compare byte for byte, which is what `publishFixedPage` does.
// That needs the slice SPANS, and `SettledPreparationV2` records `sliceCount`
// and an identity hash rather than offsets. Two necessary conditions stand in:
//
//   ORDER. Every wording the artifact says would ship occurs in the page, in
//   slice order, without overlapping.
//
//   LENGTH. The page is exactly as long as the archive plus what every slice
//   added and minus what it removed.
//
// NEITHER IS ENOUGH ALONE, which was measured rather than reasoned. Cutting two
// hundred characters out of the middle of a real published page left every
// wording in place and in order, because the scan only covers the slices and a
// page is mostly the text between them. The length invariant catches that cut
// and an order-only check does not; an order check catches wording swapped
// between two slices of equal size and a length check does not.
