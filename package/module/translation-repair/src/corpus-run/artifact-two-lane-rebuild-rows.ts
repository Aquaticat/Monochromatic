// (ledger A12). The recorded identity cannot answer it: it also hashes the
// identity context and the line-structure flags, which today's rules derive
// afresh, so every settled artifact tested differed from its rebuild while
// mikaela17's rows matched slice for slice. The rows are what the run carved:
// each slice's index, original, placement and archive span.

/**
 First way one recorded row differs from the rebuilt slice at its position.

 @param row - row the run recorded

 @param slice - slice the rebuild carved there

 @returns What differs, empty where nothing does

 @example
 ```ts
 const moved = rowDivergence({ row, slice, },);
 ```
