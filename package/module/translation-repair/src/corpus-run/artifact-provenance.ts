// What a reader must prove about the BYTES IT ACTUALLY READ before a number
// drawn from them may name a pipeline.
//
// The generation filter answers "which entries may be pooled" from a census.
// That census is a SEPARATE directory read from the one each reader performs
// afterwards, and the accumulation writes new artifacts continuously, so the
// metadata the census returned is not automatically metadata for the bytes a
// reader later loaded. A file can arrive between the two reads, and a file can
// change between being classified and being loaded.
//
// Nothing here re-reads or re-derives. It compares what the census said against
// what the reader observed, and refuses when they disagree, which is the only
// way that gap surfaces at all: every other outcome of it looks like ordinary
// output.
