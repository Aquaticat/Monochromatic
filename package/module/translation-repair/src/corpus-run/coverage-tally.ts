//region Coverage tally
// LEDGER T8: WHICH BUNDLE CODE NO TEST PROCESS RAN, over every file
// `NODE_V8_COVERAGE` wrote. V8 reports, per process and per script, each
// function as a tree of ranges whose innermost count is the count of the code
// under it, and it DROPS A NESTED RANGE WHOSE COUNT EQUALS ITS PARENT'S
// (`MergeNestedRanges` in V8's `src/debug/debug-coverage.cc`). A range one
// process lists as cold can therefore have run in a process that does not
// list it: summing the listed ranges alone called 1,061 of 2,371 blocks cold
// that ran (ledger T8, 2026-09-29).
//
// THE TALLY CUTS each bundle at every range boundary any process reported,
// gives each piece the count of its innermost enclosing range in each process,
// and sums over processes. That needs every boundary before the first piece is
// counted, so the coverage files are read twice: once through
// `noteBoundaries`, then once through `paint`.
//
// MUTABLE INSIDE, BY DESIGN. A full unit suite writes about 8 GB of coverage
// over some 860 processes; the tally folds each process into per-bundle typed
// arrays as it is read, rather than holding every process's ranges at once.
// The state lives in the factory's closure, and callers see only the frozen
// methods.
//
// FUNCTIONS ARE KEYED BY BOTH ENDS. A function that opens its chunk starts at
// offset 0, as the chunk's own top-level script function does, and keying by
// the start alone merged the two: the function took the script's empty name
// and the script's count (all five "unmatched" exports of 2026-09-28).
