// EVERY CALL THE SENSITIVITY INSTRUMENT MAKES, AS DATA, so a test can read what
// each arm sends before a run spends anything on it.
//
// `#247` found the instrument's `prior=shown` arm sending the same prompt as
// its `prior=absent` arm. It passed the prior issue and no disclosure, relying
// on the probe's default, and that default had flipped to `withheld` when
// production stopped rendering the list; the two arms then differed only in
// what the deterministic screen dismissed, while the closing note told the
// reader the difference was the production prompt. An arm that names what it
// sends, and a test that holds the name to the value, is the cure.
//
// THREE LISTS, because two effects were being conflated. `none` sends no
// prior issue at all. `withheld` sends the prior issue to the screen and not
// to the prompt, which is what production does. `rendered` writes the prior
// issue into the sheet under "PRE-EXISTING DEFECTS THIS EDIT TARGETED", which
// is the prompt production abandoned because it silenced the stage. The gap
// between `none` and `withheld` is the screen; the gap between `withheld` and
// `rendered` is the prompt.
