//region Consolidation re-seating
// THE CONSOLIDATION'S PER-SLICE HOOK, split out of `pass-consolidate.ts` so a
// test can drive it with the reading rig the lanes' hooks are tested with
// (ledger H5). Every slice waits out a named hold that keeps the slate from
// quorum (the thirteenth class's second face, the fourth hakureico pass).
//
// IT RE-SEATS THE SLICE TOO (ledger H5, 2026-09-28), as the lanes' hooks do
// (`pass-reseat.ts`). It only waited, so a dry-out inside the consolidation
// left every later slice on the writers, slate judges and naturalness roles
// read before it, the stage classes one hundred three, one hundred nine and
// one hundred thirteen had each fixed for one repair stage at a time. While a
// hold runs it reads the seats again, which waits out the hold where the bench
// cannot reach quorum, builds the roster `pass-consolidate.ts` builds from that
// reading, and keeps handing it over once the hold has ended
// (`pass-reseat-hook.ts`). While nothing is held it costs one synchronous read
// of the holds.
