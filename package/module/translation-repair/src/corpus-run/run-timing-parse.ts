//region Run timing parse
// Reads a run's own log back into the two shapes that say where its hours
// went, and answers the question the timing work was opened on.
//
// TWO LINES CARRY THE CLOCK, and neither did before the timing work:
//
//   The ROUND line, from `runGatherRound`, splits one fan-out into the time it
//   spent working and the time it spent waiting on a straggler after quorum
//   already stood. Only the second half is straggler cost. A round whose
//   quorum never stood says so instead, with the count it needed (ledger P12).
//
//   The STREAM line, from `reportStreamProgress`, carries `elapsed`, which with
//   the line's own timestamp gives each call an interval. Overlapping those
//   intervals is what achieved concurrency IS, and nothing could compute it
//   while a completion line said only when a call finished.
//
// EVERY READ NAMES WHAT IT FOUND rather than returning an absence. A completion
// line with no duration and a line that is not a completion at all are
// different facts about a log: the first says this run predates the timing work, and a
// report that folded them together would describe a mixed archive's readable
// half as the whole of it. A line whose own fields will not read is refused
// with the field named (T8, nineteenth batch: a missing field once read as one
// that lost its unit, and a completion with no outcome as an outcome of "").
//
// NO PATTERNS. Both lines are written by this codebase with fixed separators,
// so an index scan reads them exactly and says which field was missing when one
// drifts, where a pattern would only fail to match.
//
// READS IDS, COUNTS AND DURATIONS. A run log carries no corpus wording by
// construction, and nothing here would print it if it did.
