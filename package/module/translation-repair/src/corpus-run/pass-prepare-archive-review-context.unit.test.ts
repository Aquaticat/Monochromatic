/**
 Guards ledger B28: the archive block review that preparation runs over an
 unclaimed archive block reads the declared names and the cited references
 preparation already holds, on its review sheet and on its correction slate.
 Both were in hand when `pass-prepare.ts` called the review and neither was
 passed, so a detail the translator took from a page the original links was
 judged against the original alone.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention; no corpus content appears here.
