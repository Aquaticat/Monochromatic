//region Settled audit band
// Turns pairs of audits of one text into the spread the instrument moves
// through on unchanged input.
//
// THIS IS THE NUMBER EVERY OTHER NUMBER HAS TO CLEAR. `QNB` says a comparison
// resolves nothing smaller than the run-to-run spread, and the headline of
// `#115` is a comparison. A difference between archive text and fresh text that
// is narrower than the band is a difference this instrument cannot see, and
// quoting it would credit noise to the thing under test.
//
// REPORTED ON CLAIM COUNT, which is the quantity a reader quotes. The tiers are
// carried alongside because a band that is wide on raw claims and narrow on
// corroborated ones says something specific and useful: that the spread lives
// in what single voices raise rather than in what the roster agrees on.
