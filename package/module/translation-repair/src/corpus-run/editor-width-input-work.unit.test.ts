/**
 Tests that the width probe hands the editors a slice whose panel accepted an
 issue with a target-side span, and refuses one whose accepted issue names
 nothing in the translation to cut an envelope from.

 WHY THE SECOND REFUSAL IS ITS OWN. The probe compares editor rosters on the
 words the editors may change. An accepted issue that quotes only the
 original (an omission the translation shows no trace of) leaves no span in
 the translation, so no envelope exists to hand an editor, and a comparison
 run over it would measure two rosters on an empty input. The refusal names
 that wall apart from a panel that accepted nothing.

 NO NETWORK. The critics and the panel answer from a script, the same report
 from every critic and the same supporting verdict from every panelist, and
 any other stage is refused by name.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
