/**
 Tests for what the meter report says one provider's meter was reading.

 THE RECORD IS READ AT BOTH ENDS. The last reading answers what the budget is
 now, and the first says which way it moved to get there, so two readings print
 two lines and one reading prints one.

 A RECORD WITH NO NUMBERS SAYS SO. A run written before the levels were added
 carries states and no numbers, and silence there would read as a provider
 whose meter never said anything.

 EACH FIELD IS ATTRIBUTED BY THE NAME IT STARTS WITH, so a reading naming
 another provider's numbers adds nothing to this one's.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
