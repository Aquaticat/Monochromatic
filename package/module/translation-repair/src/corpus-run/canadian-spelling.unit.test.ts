/**
 Guards the Canadian spelling pass against the audit of 2026-09-26 (ledger
 K3, K7, K9, K10, K11, H14): inflections of listed stems and forms the house
 policy names were left ("honoring", "counselor", "summarised", "judgement",
 "programmes", "my mum"), a capitalised word opening a sentence or standing
 in a title-case heading was never respelled (the heading at `Chinatsu_Suzuki/page.en.md:29`
 shipped unconverted), quoted English the original carries was respelled, an
 underscore or slash beside a word stopped it, "id" inside "idée" or "id3"
 became "ID", and a quote mark in a JSX comment or a stray backtick shielded
 the rest of the text.

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
