// IT REFUSES A MODEL THAT HAS LEFT THE ROSTER, and that refusal is the point

// the models seated now; `hf:zai-org/GLM-4.7-Flash` was in it until 2026-08-24
// and is not any more. Reading a departed id as though it were current would
// let a standing mix rosters silently, and widening the production union so a
// reporting tool can hold one would loosen the type every seating decision is
// checked against. So a record from an older roster is NAMED, not read.
