/**
 * Tests for the three assertions that decide whether a settled artifact is
 * describing the run it claims to describe.
 *
 * THESE ARE THE GUARDS BETWEEN A RUN AND EVERY NUMBER READ OFF IT. The lane
 * comparison already refuses two ledgers naming different preparations, and that
 * refusal says nothing about whether either names the RIGHT one: two ledgers
 * built over some other slicing agree with each other perfectly. These three run
 * at the only boundary holding the preparation, both ledgers and both results at
 * once, so a guard here that never fires means an artifact whose recorded
 * identity names a slicing the lanes never ran over is filed as sound, and every
 * later reading of it is confidently wrong.
 *
 * `#224` IS WHY THEY ARE WORTH TESTING BY HAND. There the defect was the OPEN
 * rather than the message: the guard's wording was right and the condition never
 * fired, so every test that read the message passed while nothing was guarded.
 * Each case below drives one refusal and changes exactly one thing from a
 * fixture that passes, so a condition that stopped firing fails its own case
 * rather than hiding behind a neighbour's.
 *
 * THE INSERTION SLICE IS LOAD-BEARING IN THE FIXTURE. `incumbentKind` is decided
 * by `isInsertionChunk`, so a preparation of ordinary slices only can never
 * exercise the `absent` side, and the case about it would pass against a guard
 * that had been deleted. The fixture therefore carries one slice of each kind.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention: Simplified Chinese against English.
