//region Artifact version 2 section pairing read
// Reading which decider chose a settled preparation's aligned sections.
//
// ITS OWN FILE beside `artifact-two-lane-read-pairing.ts`, which reads the
// block pairing WITHIN each aligned section and has its own file for the same
// reason: one subject per sibling, and the whole-preparation reader has no
// room left under the file-length limit.
//
// THREE ANSWERS, NOT TWO. The block pairing reader names one absence, because
// there absence means one thing. Here the deterministic aligner deciding the
// sections is the ordinary production case, so an artifact written after the
// field says so explicitly, and only a file written before the field is
// reported as recording nothing.
//
// EVERY REFUSAL MIRRORS AN INVARIANT THE PRODUCER ALREADY HOLDS. `agreePairs`
// keeps a section pairing strictly increasing on both sides and the wire reader
// bounds every index against the section counts, so a stored pairing that runs
// backwards, stands still, or names more pairs than the preparation aligned
// was not written by this pipeline.
