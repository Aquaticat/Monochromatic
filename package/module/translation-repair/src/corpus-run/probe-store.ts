//region Probe store
// Keeps what a quota-spending probe measured, which used to survive only in
// whatever terminal ran it.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. `coverage-probe.ts` and `audit-sensitivity.ts` both printed
// their results to standard output and wrote nothing, on the reasoning that a
// caller would redirect them wherever the measurement was being kept. Nobody
// did. Both coverage scales were probed on 2026-08-16 and both audit arms ran
// three times on 2026-08-17, all of it at real quota cost, and `#106` records
// the consequence in as many words: the numbers "survive only in session
// transcripts". They cannot be re-read, re-scored, or checked by anyone, and
// the block-scale null that question 28 leans on is among them.
//
// WHY A PER-RUN FILENAME rather than the one `rows.json` that `bench-report.ts`
// writes. That entry point is asked one question at a time; these two are run
// repeatedly against the same subject on purpose, to see whether a verdict is
// stable, and a fixed name would let each rerun destroy the run it was bought
// to be compared against. That is the same loss again by a slower route, so
// runs ACCUMULATE and a reader picks between them.
//
// WHY THE IDENTITY TRAVELS WITH THE ROWS. A verdict is worth keeping only if a
// later reader can say what produced it: what it was pointed at, which models,
// which build. The version 2 artifact learned this the expensive way and a
// probe result inherits it here, so a file found on disk months later answers
// for itself instead of needing the transcript that this module exists to stop
// depending on.
//
// WHY WHAT IT WAS POINTED AT LIVES IN `subject` rather than in a top-level
// corpus pin, which is where it started. `audit-sensitivity` reads NO corpus:
// its inputs are invented fixtures, and a required corpus field would have made
// it record a commit that had nothing to do with its verdicts. Recording a
// value that means "not applicable" as though it were a value is the exact
// defect class this whole generation exists to stop, so the field went where it
// is always true: every probe can say what it was pointed at, and only some of
// them are pointed at a corpus.
//
// WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: interpret rows. Every probe owns its own
// row shape, they are all still prototypes, and a store that named their fields
// would turn each field change into a two-file change for no reader's benefit.
