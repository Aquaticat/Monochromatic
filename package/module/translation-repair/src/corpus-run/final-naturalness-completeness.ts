//region Final naturalness completeness

/**
 Refuses schema-eight artifact without absolute approval of every consolidated body slice.

 Parser recomputes final review verdict and exact-text digest rather than
 trusting writer aggregate. Syntax-bearing front matter remains explicitly
 exempt, an unendorsed standing that shipped with its finding under the
 no-loop design is accepted as recorded, and every other absent review fails
 closed.

 THE CONTEST AND THE CONSOLIDATION BOTH RAN on every artifact this is handed:
 `persistSettledEntry` is its one caller, and the pass hands that only what
 `settledEntryArtifact` writes, a contested selection over a settled
 consolidation. Any other pairing is a writer this guard was never shown, so
 it is refused out loud rather than read as nothing to review.

 @param artifact - in-memory artifact before page or artifact persistence

 @throws {@link NaturalnessCompletenessError} when body polish lacks approval

 @throws Error when the artifact records its contest as other than contested
 or its consolidation as other than settled, which no persisted artifact does

 @example
 ```ts
 assertFinalNaturalnessComplete({ artifact, });
 ```
