// THE ONE READER OF THE WHOLE COMMAND LINE every runner takes (ledger B75).
//
// Each runner used to find its own flags with `indexOf` or `includes` on the
// exact token, so a flag written any other way read as not written at all.
// `--cap=0` bought every subject the settled audit could buy, `--olny Toka_ls`
// or a mistyped `--plan` ran every pending corpus entry for real, a second
// `--only` was dropped, and a command that takes no flags ran as if nothing
// had been typed after it. B73 gave the flag VALUES one reader; the line itself
// still had none, so nothing said which tokens a command reads at all.
//
// EVERY RUNNER NOW DECLARES WHAT IT READS, in `command-lines.ts`, and
// `reportingRefusals` reads the whole line against that before the command
// starts. Node's `parseArgs` splits the line, so the equals form, the `--`
// terminator and grouped short flags read as they do for every Node command.
// It runs with `strict` off and hands back its tokens, and every refusal is
// written here: all of them at once, in the words the B73 readers already
// used, and a number written with a minus sign after a flag still reaches the
// reader that answers it as below zero, which strict `parseArgs` refuses as
// ambiguous before any reader sees it.

 `-3` slices would be told it has no flag `-3` rather than that a count cannot
 be below one, which is what was typed (ledger B73). Python's argparse reads
 such an argument as a value for the same reason when no flag looks like a
 number, and no flag here does.
