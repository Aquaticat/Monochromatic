//region Draw reconcile refusal
// Why a final draw refuses an artifact it cannot reconcile with its parsed
// accepted population, as one marked class.
//
// THE ENTRY ID IS PRINTED ON PURPOSE. `run-json-read.ts` leaves that decision
// to the callers that hold an id, and this one holds it: an operator whose
// draw was refused needs to know which artifact to look at, and the pass
// already names entries on its `INCOMPLETE` lines. The id is a corpus path
// segment and carries no wording. WHAT SAT UNDER `acceptedCount` IS NOT
// PRINTED: the earlier bare `Error` copied it through `JSON.stringify`, and a
// stray value there could be anything, so only its `typeof` name travels.
