//region Artifact version 2 comparison
// How version 2 decides what a comparison row SAYS, frozen the way its
// vocabulary is.
//
// The vocabulary froze the words and this freezes the rules, which are two
// different things and only one of them was done. `buildSettledTwoLaneArtifact`
// derived its persisted comparison by calling the LIVE comparator and
// projecting the answer, so a later change to how a verdict is decided would
// have silently reinterpreted every artifact already on disk: nothing in the
// file records which rules produced it, and a reader recomputing with the same
// changed comparator would agree with itself while both disagreed with what the
// artifact meant when it was written.
//
// So the rules live here, under a version 2 name, over version 2 ROWS. Changing
// them means editing a file whose name says which generation it defines, which
// is as loud as the union snapshot next door. The live comparator keeps its own
// job: it checks two ledgers against each other and refuses pairs that cannot
// be compared at all, which is a runtime invariant rather than a persisted
// meaning.
//
// DELIBERATELY DUPLICATED, therefore, and the duplication is checked rather
// than trusted: `buildSettledTwoLaneArtifact` runs both and refuses a disagreement,
// so the day the live rules move, a corpus pass stops rather than quietly
// writing artifacts that mean something new under an unchanged version number.
