// THE PAGE PASSES READ THE PAGE THE GUARD LEAVES (ledger K5). A lane row the
// footnote guard takes back, or a container half withheld because its partner
// ships nothing, leaves the archive's text standing at that slice; but the
// passes had read the lane's row there, so the archive text shipped as no pass
// had read it: a day-first date an untouched slice would carry month first
// stayed day first. And a cross-slice pass (a handle's gloss placed at its
// first appearance) could decide on a row the page no longer carries (A15).
// So the passes and the guard run again over the rows left, until a round
// takes back no slice an earlier round had not; each round after the first
// adds a slice to those taken back, so the rounds are at most one more than
// the slices.
//
// A ROUND THAT TAKES BACK ONLY WHAT WAS ALREADY TAKEN BACK SETTLES (ledger
// T8, 2026-09-29). Two passes rewrite the archive's text on every slice the
// page carries, so a later round can hand the guard a pass-made row at a
// slice whose lane row an earlier round withdrew; were the guard to take that
// row back, every later round would make and lose it again. That round threw
// until 2026-09-29, which stopped the entry's page; the owner's rule is that
// a run always ships. The page it settles on is consistent: the slice stays
// withdrawn and ships the archive's text, and the caller writes no pass row
// the settling round's guard took back.
