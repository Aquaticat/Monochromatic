// WHICH BYTES RAN, as against which commit happened to be checked out.
//
// Every artifact records `tip`, the git HEAD object id at the moment its pass
// started. That is worth keeping as provenance, and it has ancestry, which a
// digest cannot have. It is not an identity for executed code in either
// direction:
//
//   A docs-only commit moves HEAD without changing a byte that runs. Two
//   behaviourally identical passes then land in different generations, neither
//   resumable into the other, and a pool that should have been one is refused.
//
//   An uncommitted edit changes what runs without moving HEAD. Two genuinely
//   different pipelines then record the same tip and are pooled silently. That
//   direction is the dangerous one, because nothing anywhere reports it and the
//   rate that comes out describes no pipeline that ever existed.
//
// Every corpus-run task now builds first and runs its built file under
// `dist/final/node`, so the bytes that execute are a directory and a digest over
// that directory answers the question `tip` was standing in for.
//
// Measured on this build before the module was written: two clean rebuilds of
// unchanged source produced byte-identical output across all 69 emitted files,
// and a file planted in the output directory was gone after the next build, so
// the digest is a function of the source rather than of build history.
