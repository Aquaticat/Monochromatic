/**
 Tests for the join of human repair grades to probe readings that
 `score-probe` prints.

 A wrong join does not fail, it mislabels, so a case holds the join by
 position, the refusal of a sheet and a manifest of different lengths, the
 count of rewritten slices and the lines printed.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
