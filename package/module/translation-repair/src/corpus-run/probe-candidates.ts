// WHICH SEATABLE MODELS A PROBE MEASURES BESIDE THE SEATED ONES, read off the
// command line.
//
// THE RUN ROSTER IS THE MEASURED ROSTER. Since 2026-09-01 a model takes a role
// on the numbers `judge-fidelity-probe` and `producer-calibrate` report, and
// since 2026-09-07 the roster names two sizes nobody has measured, the Gemma 4
// sizes only Amazon Bedrock serves. Those stay out of `RUN_ROSTER` until the
// probes have read them, and the probes ran the run roster, so nothing could
// ever measure them: a seat that needs a number to be taken could not be asked
// for one.
//
// `--candidates` BREAKS THAT CIRCLE. It names seatable ids, comma separated,
// that join the probe's roster for that run only: they judge beside the seated
// judges in the fidelity probe, and write and judge beside the seated roster in
// the calibration. Nothing outside the probes reads it. A name the roster does
// not know is refused with the names it does, because a probe that quietly ran
// without the model it was started for would print a clean standing over the
// wrong roster, which is the failure `asked-count.ts` exists to stop.
//
// `--candidates-alone` RUNS THE CANDIDATES WITHOUT THE SEATED ROSTER. The
// fidelity probe reads each ballot by the judge that cast it, so two judges
// measured on their own answer the same per-judge question as eleven, and they
// answer it at the candidates' provider only: a probe run beside a production
// pass then spends nothing the pass is spending. The calibration ranks
// producers by disinterested ballots, which two seats cannot supply, so it runs
// the flag too and is refused by `assertJudgeableProducerRoster` on its own
// terms.
