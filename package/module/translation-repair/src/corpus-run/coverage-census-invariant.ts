//region Coverage census invariant throws
// Ledger T8: the invariant throws of a census, which it counts apart from
// the cold stretches. A stretch no test ran that is nothing but throws of a
// broken invariant (`coverage-invariant-throw.ts` reads which) is no code a
// test should reach: no honest input gets there, by the invariant. Counted
// as cold it reads as work left for ever, and the one way to close it is to
// delete the guard, which ledger M112 recorded as a prevention and which
// inverts the package's rule that a broken invariant is loud. So no row and
// no total of cold code holds such a stretch, and the report prints their
// count beside the cold counts and names each by source and line, so a reader
// can audit what the census set aside.
