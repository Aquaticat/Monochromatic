/**
 Tests for the `score-agreement` runner: the built command over a graded
 sheet, a manifest and pre-grades a case wrote.

 The runner reads files and prints precision and agreement, so its as-built
 cases run to the end of the report on a fixture and read the whole of what
 it printed. Every child is started by `runBuiltScore`, whose environment
 carries no variable ending in `_API_KEY`.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
