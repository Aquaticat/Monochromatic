/**
 Tests for the roster bench report: the widths a roster sweeps and which one
 it repeats, the file the rows land in, and the token sums on a summary line.

 The report is the only durable record of a width sweep, and it is written
 atomically under the runs directory; the write was unproven until this suite.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
