/**
 Tests for how `verify-published` reads a whole run: the artifacts and the
 published tree of a throwaway runs directory listed, paired, judged entry by
 entry and reported, with the exit code the command leaves.

 What is printed is read off `console.log` through a diverting capture, which
 is process-wide, so the suite runs one case at a time.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
