//region CLI refusal
// Turns ANY failure out of a CLI body into a report that quotes nothing.
//
// `#222` closed the half of `#220` that mattered most: a run file no longer
// prints itself when it will not parse. Verifying that at the boundary showed
// the other half still open. The refusal is safe now, but it is still UNCAUGHT,
// and a bundled CLI is one line of minified JavaScript, so Node echoes about
// three thousand characters of it around a correct one-line message.
//
// THIS USED TO CATCH ONLY `RunJsonUnreadableError`, and said so: catching every
// `Error` would hide the stack of a genuine programming fault, trading a rare
// ugly report for a permanently undiagnosable one. That reasoning was right
// about the cost and wrong about the choice, because the two are separable.
//
// `#225` supplied the fact the old note did not have. A `YAMLParseError`
// message embeds a source code frame, measured on five failure shapes and
// present in all five, and Node renders a cause chain. Re-throwing therefore
// published a page's front matter, which names a person, through a printer that
// never agreed to. Re-throwing is not neutral; it delegates the decision to
// whatever prints next.
//
// SO EVERYTHING IS CAUGHT, AND THE STACK IS KEPT ANYWAY. What is dropped is the
// message line and the cause chain, which is where text travels; what is kept
// is the frames, which name files inside our own `dist`. A fault stays
// diagnosable, and a class that declares its message quote-free still gets to
// say it in full.
//
// `#226` put EVERY corpus-run entry point through this, thirty-eight of them,
// after measuring the four cells it turns on. Running the source on a throwaway
// fixture under node's type stripping:
//
//   bare, marked error      exit 1, 708 bytes. A stack dump, and Node also
//                           spills the error's own fields as an object literal.
//   wrapped, marked error   exit 4, 193 bytes. The message, and what to do.
//   bare, unmarked error    exit 1, 554 bytes. Class, message and stack.
//   wrapped, unmarked error exit 5, 662 bytes. Class and frames, no message.
//
// So this is an outright win on a refusal, and on a fault it trades the message
// for a code that separates a fault from a refusal from the command's own
// verdict. Unwrapped, all three are `1`. The lost message is the policy in
// `refusal-text.ts` failing closed, and the lever that gets it back is marking
// more of our own classes, not unwrapping the commands.
//
// A VERDICT SURVIVES because `process.exitCode` is set only in the catch here,
// which was measured before the change rather than read off this file:
// `verify-published` still exits `2` on a run it cannot check, byte-identical.
//
// `ledger-report.ts` is wrapped like the rest, but almost nothing reaches this
// from it. It reads a whole directory and reports the files that refused as a
// shortfall inside its own output, which is a better answer than stopping, and
// its closing comment records why. This catches only what escapes that.
