//region Editor width input
// Work for the editors to do, gathered the way production gathers it.
//
// The width comparison needs slices that carry ACCEPTED ISSUES, because the
// repair lane edits nothing else. Two routes exist and this takes the more
// expensive one deliberately.
//
// The cheap route reads issues out of a settled artifact. It was rejected: the
// artifacts were written by earlier slicings, `#157` and `#159` both moved
// where slice boundaries fall, and `#99` is the standing record of sliceIndex
// meaning different things to different stamps. Issues carrying offsets into a
// target that today's slicer cuts differently would place envelopes over the
// wrong words, and the probe would be measuring editors handed nonsense.
//
// So the critics and the panel run fresh over the drawn slice. That costs a
// critic round and a panel round per slice, buys inputs that cannot be
// misaligned with their own text, and is what the whole comparison rests on.
