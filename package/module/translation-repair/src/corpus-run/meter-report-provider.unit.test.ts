/**
 Tests for what the meter report says of one provider across the record.

 AN AVAILABILITY IS OVER THE READINGS THAT ANSWERED. A meter that could not be
 read says nothing about budget, so a provider whose every reading was
 unreadable has no measurable fraction, and the report says so instead of
 printing zero.

 A SAMPLE THAT PREDATES A PROVIDER CONTRIBUTES NO READING for it, so a record
 older than a provider reports it with nothing counted.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
