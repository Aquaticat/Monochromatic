// CLASS SIXTY-SEVEN (XingZ616, 2026-09-19). A contributor's name in a section
// heading (`其三：绘都`) was translated word for word ("Painted Capital") while
// the archive renders the same person's signature as the handle the human
// translator knew ("HiYku"), and one lane respelt the archive's handle in the
// signature itself ("Huidu"). Each slice's judges saw one heading or one
// signature; none saw that the two name one person. THE PAGE DECIDES ONCE,
// HERE: a name the original both heads a section with and signs is a person,
// and the page renders it one way everywhere. The archive's signature
// rendering is the authority where the archive carries the signature; else
// the page's own signature rendering; a name with neither stays as rendered.
// The archive's own text is never rewritten: only slices a lane replaced.
//
// CLASS EIGHTY-THREE (XingZ622, 2026-09-22). EVERY SIGNER, HEADED OR NOT,
// AND A HANDLE LEFT IN HAN READ AS PINYIN. 锦心 shipped as 锦心 in the Part
// Ten heading and signature (the slate chose "keeps the original form, no
// declared English" over the lane's "Jinxin", and this pass then wrote the
// signature's Han into the heading), and 雨狸, whom no heading names, shipped
// as "Yu Li" on one song credit and 雨狸 on the next. Owner, 2026-09-22:
// pinyin as one capitalised word, the literal meaning in parentheses. So
// every signer takes an authority, not only the headed ones, and a page
// rendering that still carries Han is no rendering, the handle's own
// reading standing in its place (`contributor-name-authorities.ts`,
// `handle-reading.ts`); and a heading or signature carrying the rendering
// with its gloss in parentheses is left as it is, since the gloss belongs
// at the first appearance.
