//
// These two answers had drifted apart, and the drift was invisible in both
// directions. The scheduler took any `*.json` NAME, so a directory or a symlink
// called `Mittens.json` marked Mittens settled and the entry was never run
// again; the census skips non-regular files, so no guard ever reported it. The
// entry silently ceased to exist, exactly as an unplaceable artifact does,
// without even an unplaceable artifact to name.
//
// Split from `corpus-pass.ts` at its line cap, and this is the seam worth
// splitting on: the scheduler asks a different question from every rate-
// producing reader, sees every generation on purpose, and now shares one
// listing with the reader that judges those files.

 Entry ids this directory already carries an artifact for.

 Unfiltered by generation ON PURPOSE. A scheduler that skipped entries settled
 by another pipeline would re-run them into the same directory and mix
 generations, which is the failure the resume guard refuses outright.
