/**
 Tests for the store that resumes ballots an earlier run bought.

 WHY THE SHAPE IS CHECKED DOWN TO THE BALLOT rather than to the outcome, which
 is the claim these cases exist to prove. The artifact reader refuses a ballot
 it cannot read, so a store that resumed one would let a corrupted cache file
 settle an entry into an artifact no reader will take: the pass would spend a
 whole document and then write a file that fails to parse. Refusing it here
 costs one re-asked slice.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention written into throwaway directories.
