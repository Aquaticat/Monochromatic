 Reads every named log and reports where its hours went.

 @param line - the report's command line, read whole by `reportingRefusals`,
 which refuses it when no log is named: any log a pass, probe or calibration
 wrote will do, and passing several reads them as one run

 @example
 ```ts
 await reportRunTiming({ line, },);
