/**
 Tests for the one-pass-at-a-time claim on a runs directory.

 Two passes sharing a directory never collide loudly. They overwrite each
 other's attempt counts, delete each other's cached slices whenever their
 pipelines differ, and the later write of any entry replaces the earlier one.
 Every one of those looks like ordinary output, which is why the refusal has
 to happen before any of it starts.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
