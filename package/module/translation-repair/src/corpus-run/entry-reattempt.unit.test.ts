/**
 Tests for whether a capped entry earns another attempt inside one invocation.
 
 The largest entries were measured as unable to settle inside the 420-minute
 hard cap, and the way out ranked first needs a build that does not move
 between attempts. One invocation IS such a window, so the pass now re-queues
 an entry that made progress. What that costs if it is wrong is the whole
 three-day soft budget spent on one entry, so the stop condition is the part
 worth testing hardest.
 
 THE TWO CASES THAT MATTER ARE BOTH COUNTERINTUITIVE, and both are about a
 cache count that FELL. A settled entry discards its cache on the way out, so
 inferring progress from the count alone would read the one outcome the pass
 exists to reach as the sharpest possible stall. A reset cache, from an entry
 carrying slices of an older build, reads as negative progress while actually
 being a fresh generation's first attempt.
 
 `countCachedSlices` is tested against a real directory rather than a stub
 because the thing it has to get right is which files are slices, and the
 generation markers that must not be counted are real files with a real
 suffix sitting in the same directory.
