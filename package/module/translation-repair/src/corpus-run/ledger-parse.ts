// TURNS A LEDGER FILE ON DISK INTO A SHAPE THE READER CAN TRUST, refusing
// anything that does not carry what a contest needs.
//
// MODEL IDS ARE READ AS PLAIN STRINGS, deliberately, and not as the catalog
// union the writer held. A ledger is read to ask questions ABOUT the roster,
// including about a seat that has since been dropped, so narrowing a recorded
// id back into today's catalog would be a claim this reader cannot support and
// does not need: it only compares ids to each other and prints them.
//
// `weight` AND `selfVote` ARE NOT READ. Nothing downstream uses them. The
// reader works out who had a stake in each candidate from the producer lists,
// because it needs that for EVERY candidate on the slate and `selfVote` speaks
// only about the one its ballot named. Reading it as a cross-check would prove
// nothing either: `candidate-select.ts` and `candidate-ledger.ts` both derive
// their answer from `producerModelIds` on the same producer, in one process, so
// the two can never disagree.
