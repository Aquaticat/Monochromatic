/**
 Tests for the sentences the damage command says about its pool and its sheet.

 EACH COUNT SHOWS ITS NOUN IN THE FORM IT ASKS FOR, and the verb of the clause
 about rows left out follows the count: one row is not drawn from where two
 rows are not. The counts are handed in directly, since a pool holding a row
 with no incumbent wording is one a fixture artifact cannot cheaply be built
 to produce.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
