//region Asked count
// How many units a person asked a bench or calibration to run, read off the
// command line and refused when it is not a count.
//
// FOUR CLIs SPELLED THIS `Number(process.argv[2] ?? String(DEFAULT_SLICES,),)`
// and none of them checked the result. `Number('fourty')` is `NaN`,
// `pickSpreadSample` takes `slice(0, NaN)` and returns nothing, and the run
// then edits, judges and reports over an empty sample. It prints its roster, it
// prints its totals, it exits zero, and every number in it is over no slices at
// all. It was measured: `count NaN -> picked 0`.
//
// A CALIBRATION THAT MEASURED NOTHING IS WORSE THAN ONE THAT REFUSED, because
// the operator reads the clean exit as evidence. That is the whole argument for
// putting a refusal here rather than a fallback: falling back to the default
// would also hide the typo, and would spend a roster doing it.
//
// ZERO IS REFUSED TOO, unlike the audit's `--cap 0`. That cap has a use, namely
// reading a whole archive and buying nothing, and these have none: a bench over
// zero slices asks nobody anything and reports nothing. Where a run wants to do
// nothing, not running it is the way to say so.
//
// DIGITS ONLY, by the package's one count rule (ledger B73). This reader once
// truncated `40.9` to 40 and took `4e1`, `0x28` and `+40` as forty: a count
// nobody typed, run without a word. A minus sign before digits is still
// answered as a count below one, since that is what was typed.

/**
 Smallest count worth running, since a bench over none measures nothing.
