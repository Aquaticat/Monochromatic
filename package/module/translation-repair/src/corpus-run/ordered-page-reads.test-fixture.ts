// A PAGE READER WHOSE REFUSALS END IN AN ORDER A CASE CHOOSES.

// TEST SUPPORT, NOT PACKAGE SOURCE. A site that reads several pages gets one
// refusal per page, each naming its own page. A case hands the site this
// reader in place of `readCorpusFile`: every read refuses with git's text for
// an absent path and the probe's answer the case names (a commit the clone
// holds, so each page is absent there, or one it lacks), the reads whose path
// holds `endsLast` refuse only after every other read has, and the rest refuse
// at once.

/**
 Makes a reader whose every read refuses, in an order the case fixes.

 @param endsLast - text a path holds when its read refuses after the others

 @param commit - what the probe of the pinned commit found, which decides
 whether each refusal is a page absent at a held commit or a commit the clone
 lacks

 @returns A reader to pass in place of `readCorpusFile`

 @example
 ```ts
 const readFile = pageReadsRefusingLastFor({ endsLast: '/page.md', commit: 'held', },);
