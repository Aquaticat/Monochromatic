// calling case's own sandbox, `ctx.sinon`, which module-test answers only to
// that case (`sandbox-slot.ts`) and restores when the case ends; disposing
// the capture restores it sooner. The stub records each call's arguments, and
// a line is read off them the way console.log itself prints them
// (`util.format`), so no fake stands in for console.log and no part of a
// call is dropped.
//
// TEST SUPPORT, NOT PACKAGE SOURCE. artifact-placement,
// rendering-audit-settled and rendering-audit-settled-report kept their own
// copy of the relaying capture, and bench-report-groups and
// probe-telemetry-report of the diverting one, each assigning console.log
// directly; all five now import these.
