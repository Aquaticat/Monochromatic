//region Artifact version 2 row relations
// What has to hold between a lane's LEDGER and the raw result recorded beside
// it, row by row.
//
// The two are separate derivations of one run. The ledger is what a reader
// compares, because the writer checked it against that lane's own document;
// the raw result is the evidence behind it. Nothing in the file forces them to
// describe the same run, so a reader that took either on trust could report a
// slice the other contradicts.
//
// BY POSITION, never joined on `chunkIndex`. Both lists are in document order
// by contract, so position is the join, and joining on the index instead would
// accept a result whose rows are in some other order while reporting that
// everything matched.
//
// THE COHERENCE CHECKS ARE HERE TOO, and they are a different question from
// parsing: exact parsing says every word in a row is one this version knows,
// and these say the words in one row can be true together. A row saying its
// document carries a shipped replacement while its lane reports having had
// nothing to do there parses cleanly and cannot have happened.

 * reasoning is sound and does not reach this far: renumbering produces GAPS,
