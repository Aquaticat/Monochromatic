//region Producer calibrate round

// judging, and what it leaves behind for the standing to be summed from.

 What one slice produced, with everyone who wrote on it.

 THE AUTHORS ARE CARRIED APART FROM THE ROUND, because a standing is summed
 from ballots and a slate can hold a candidate no ballot ever named. Without
 this list a model its provider refused and a model whose wording every peer
 proposed word for word are both simply absent from the table, and the two
 call for opposite readings.

 @example
 ```ts
 const { round, authors, } = await runCalibrationRound({ slice, roster, client, },);
 ```
