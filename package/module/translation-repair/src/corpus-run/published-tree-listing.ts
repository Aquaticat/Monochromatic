// no artifacts directory at all printed the same stdout summary as a run whose
// every page agreed with its artifact, and left the same exit code behind. A

// person reading the report and by whatever runs it as a gate.

// directory is nothing to check. No published tree BESIDE REAL ARTIFACTS is
// every settled entry unpublished, which is the most serious finding this
// check can make, so it must stay a finding rather than collapse into silence.
//
// PRINTS AND RETURNS IDS, NAMES AND COUNTS. Never a passage, because a run
// directory holds unlicensed corpus wording.

/**
 Decides whether a run has anything to verify at all.
 
 TWO WAYS TO VERIFY NOTHING, and both have to leave a verdict that says so,
 which is the verifier's one nonzero exit. An artifacts directory that is not
 there means the caller is pointed at something that is not a run. An
 artifacts directory holding no artifact means the run settled no entry.
 Neither is a clean run, and both once read as one.

 AN ABSENT PUBLISHED TREE IS DELIBERATELY NOT ONE OF THEM. Beside real
 artifacts it means every settled entry was never published: no pass settles
 those entries again, and the archive ships for each until the next pass
 started in the runs directory writes its page from the artifact (ledger
 A16c). Reporting that as an empty tree keeps it a finding the caller counts,
 rather than a silence that ends the report.
