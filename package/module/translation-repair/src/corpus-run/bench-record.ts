//region Bench record
// What one bench run costs, measured rather than asserted.
//
// The stage reports its own decisions, but nothing in it reports what those
// decisions COST, and cost is half of the roster-width question. This wraps the
// client so every exchange leaves a row: which schema was asked for, which
// model answered, how long it took, how many tokens it moved, and whether the
// answer was usable. Nothing about the pipeline changes; the wrapper observes.
//
// The stage is identified by the RESPONSE SCHEMA NAME rather than by a label
// the caller passes, because the caller here is `runTranslateStage` and it does
// not take one. The schema name is what actually distinguishes a translate call
// from a ballot or a repair turn.
