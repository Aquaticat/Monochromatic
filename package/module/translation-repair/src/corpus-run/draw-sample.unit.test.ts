/**
 Boundary test for the draw sample command.

 The command reads every settled artifact of a runs directory and the corpus
 page of each, so what is checked here is what only the built command can
 show: what it prints and exits with on a throwaway runs directory, over a
 throwaway corpus clone, with no provider key in its environment. Its
 procedures have their own suites.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
