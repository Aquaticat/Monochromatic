//region Cap census read
// THE COMPLETION CAP RULE, RE-READ OVER LATER RUNS (ledger P10). The caps were
// measured once, on 2026-09-09 (`completion-cap.ts`), and a card that took the
// pooled placeholder for want of calls kept it long after it had 67,353 of its
// own. No unit test can see the run logs, and a test that failed on a date
// would fail for the calendar, so the rule is re-read by this census before a
// launch instead.
//
// TWO READINGS, BECAUSE THE CAP CENSORS WHAT IT MEASURES. The rule's own
// reading (the highest provider 99th percentile over providers with enough
// calls, floored at the pooled 90th) takes every completed call; the cut
// reading takes the calls since the caps went on the wire and asks how many ran
// to the card's cap and whether their streams carried content. A capped call
// cannot show a longer answer, so a rule reading equal to the cap means "at
// least one percent ran into it", and the cut reading says whether those were
// answers or reasoning runaways.
//
// PAIRED BY LABEL AND CLOCK. A stream's completion line and its `SPEND` line
// are written by the same exchange within milliseconds, so a `SPEND` line takes
// the latest unpaired completion of the same served id within the window; one
// with none is counted as unpaired, never guessed. A line whose stamp the
// logger did not write is left out and counted, since no clock pairs or dates
// it (ledger B73).
//
// NO PATTERNS AND NO WORDING. Both lines are this codebase's own, read by index
// scans; the census carries ids and numbers only.
