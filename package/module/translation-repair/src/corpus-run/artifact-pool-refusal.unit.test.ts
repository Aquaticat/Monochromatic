/**
 * Tests for the noun a pool refusal counts entries with.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. A refusal names how many entries each built pipeline
 * holds, and someone reads that listing to decide which generation to keep.
 * Measured on 2026-08-25, always saying `entries` failed no case, so the one
 * generation holding a single entry read as `1 entries` with nothing to catch
 * it.
 *
 * THE COUNT ITSELF is pinned in `artifact-pool-generation-lines.unit.test.ts`,
 * which is a separate file because `await describe` throws and one GFP round
 * cannot read two suites that share one.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
 *
 * @module
