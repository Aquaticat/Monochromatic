/**
 Boundary test for the budget sample command.

 The command reads every provider's meter, so what is checked here is what
 only the built command can show with no provider key in its environment: it
 refuses as stated, names each variable and whether it is present, exits 6 and
 prints nothing to stdout, before any request. Its procedures have their own
 suites.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
