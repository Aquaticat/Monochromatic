/**
 Tests for the coverage census command at its boundary: the built command
 run in a child process whose environment carries no provider key, over
 package directories the cases build, so it stops at each refusal it states
 before it runs any suite.

 THE COMMAND IS NEVER RUN TO ITS END HERE. Past the checks of its build
 directory it runs the unit suite in a child, which would run this very case
 inside itself, so every case stops at a refusal: a command line it will not
 read, a baseline it cannot read, or a build directory that is no coverage
 build. The census past those checks is cased through the functions it moved
 into (`coverage-census-run.unit.test.ts` and the files beside it), with the
 steps that touch git, the suite and the coverage handed in.

 EACH CASE RUNS IN A SCRATCH DIRECTORY as the package directory, because the
 command reads its build directory from the working directory it stands in.
 The child is started by `runBuiltCommand`, which removes every variable whose
 name ends in `_API_KEY` and every one whose name starts `TRANSLATION_REPAIR_`
 before it adds the cache home the case names.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
