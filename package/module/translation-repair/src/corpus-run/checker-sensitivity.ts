// Asks whether the resolution checkers can say NO.
//
// Across real-corpus artifacts the checkers called 2215 of 2257 accepted issues
// resolved, 98.1 percent. That number is quoted as evidence the repair works,
// and it cannot carry that weight until the stage is shown to discriminate: a
// checker that answers `fixed` to everything produces exactly this rate whether
// or not anything was repaired, and `resolvedIssueIds` feeds both candidate
// selection and the milestone's headline.
//
// EVERY SHEET HERE IS HAND-WRITTEN FIXTURE TEXT, so each call passes
// `UNATTRIBUTED_TEXT`: no roster model wrote a word of it and no verdict is
// discounted. Attributing any of it would measure the self-certification
// discount rather than the checkers, which is the one thing this probe asks.
//
// The probe sensitivity check settled the same question for the introduced-
// defect stage and was worth every one of its three calls. This is the same
// experiment aimed at the older, more load-bearing stage.
//
// Cat-themed invention throughout. No corpus text, licensed or otherwise, and
// nothing is written.
