// Checks a run's PUBLISHED TREE against the artifacts that produced it: the
// wiring only. It spends no quota and touches no model. What it reads and
// prints is in `verify-published-run.ts` and `verify-published-entry.ts`, and
// what a pass does about a disagreement is in `page-agreement.ts` and
// `published-page-check.ts`.
//
// A RUN ALWAYS SHIPS (the owner, 2026-09-27; ledger A16b). Every finding is
// printed and the exit is 0; only a run that could not be read at all exits
// otherwise, since that run was never examined.
