//region Coverage control decoy cut
// The cut that must not change the roster's answer.
//
// The absence control's whole claim rests on the two cuts being comparable: the
// same document, the same passage, the same number of characters, differing
// only in whether the deleted text is what the roster pointed at. A decoy that
// silently overlapped the anchored spans would delete the rendering too and
// report the wire as trigger-happy when it was reading correctly.
//
// Fixtures are invented cat prose, never corpus text.
