// WHAT EACH MODEL WROTE, AND WHAT THE JUDGES SAID ABOUT IT. Spends no quota and
// touches no model.
//
// WITHOUT A MODEL NAMED it reports the whole ledger: who wrote how much, how
// often it was chosen, and the two ballot faults counted apart.
//
// WITH `--model <id>` it prints that seat's candidates and the reasons judges
// gave for choosing them. That is the question a standing cannot answer: a low
// share means a seat was rarely picked as the best of several, which is not the
// same as writing something wrong, and only the text says which it was.
//
// PRINTS CORPUS WORDING when a model is named, because the candidate text IS
// the evidence. A run directory already holds it. Do not paste this output
// anywhere public.
//
// THE SUMMARY VIEW PRINTS NO WORDING AT ALL, and `ledger-directory.ts` is what
// keeps that true when a file will not read.
//
// THIS FILE IS ONLY THE WIRING: the command line, and the runs directory the
// environment names. `ledger-report-run.ts` holds the procedure and
// `ledger-report-print.ts` the printers.
