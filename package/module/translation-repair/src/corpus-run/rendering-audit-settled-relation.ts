// Says whether the wording one audit subject carries is the wording a document
// assembled today would carry, WITHOUT changing what the audit reads.
//
// WHY BESIDE RATHER THAN INSTEAD. `#166` recorded a prescription to route the
// settled audit through `wouldShipTextPerSlice`, and measuring the archive
// refuted it. Of 47 settled artifacts, 33 carry `pending-human-decision` and no
// consolidation, so under a would-ship reading their text falls all the way to
// the archive: routing the audit through it would put the ARCHIVE's own
// English under audit at 227 of 271 subjects, which is precisely the case
// `auditsArchiveText` exists to separate out, since the instrument was built
// for output with no BEFORE text.
//
// SO THE SUBJECT KEEPS ITS LANE MEANING and gains this annotation. The audit
// still reads what the judges really decided; a reading of the results can now
// tell which of those decisions a later stage overruled.
//
// THREE ANSWERS, NOT TWO, and the third is the point. The archive standing on
// an artifact nobody has decided is the ABSENCE of a decision, not a
// displacement, and it is absent pending `#175` with the owner. Collapsing it
// into "the archive ships instead" would be stale the day that is answered.
//
// THE DECIDER IS CARRIED BY REFERENCE rather than spelled into member names
// like `displaced-by-consolidation`. Spelling them would duplicate
// `WouldShipDecider`'s list, so a decider added later would silently produce no
// new relation. That is the drift class `#170` measured, twice, in this family.
