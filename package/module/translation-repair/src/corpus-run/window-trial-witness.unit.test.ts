/**
 * Tests for the live-run window check.
 *
 * WHAT THESE PIN is that the check can fail. Every other test in this family
 * proves the window is forwarded against a synthetic client, so the only thing
 * left for the live check to catch is the case where the code path is right and
 * the wire is wrong. A witness that silently passed would be worse than no
 * witness, because the run would then carry a check nobody could distinguish
 * from a working one.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention mirroring corpus structure only.
