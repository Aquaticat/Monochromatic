/**
 Tests for the `score-crosscheck` runner: the built command over a runs
 directory a case wrote.

 The runner reads settled artifacts and prints the population a judge
 crosscheck would run over, so its as-built cases run to the end of the report
 on a fixture and read the whole of what it printed. Every child is started
 by `runBuiltScore`, whose environment carries no variable ending in `_API_KEY`.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
