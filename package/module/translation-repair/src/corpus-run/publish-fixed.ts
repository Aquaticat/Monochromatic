/**
 Turns one settled entry's per-slice readings into the replacements that
 assemble its page.
 
 A SILENT SLICE CONTRIBUTES EMPTY TEXT AT A CONTENT SPAN AND NOTHING AT ALL AT
 AN ANCHOR, which are two answers rather than one because silence itself means
 two things. Over a span the archive already renders, the empty string is what
 the deciders chose: they agreed the passage carries no wording, and omitting
 the row would republish the archive underneath that decision and undo it. At
 an anchor there is no archive wording to republish and none to remove, so the
 honest contribution is no row at all, leaving `spliceSlices` to pass the gap
 through exactly as it found it.
 
 THE ANCHOR HALF IS WHAT `XIEPT2` COST FOUR HOURS AND FORTY-EIGHT MINUTES TO
 ESTABLISH. This builder used to hand every silent slice the empty string, and
 `spliceSlices` refuses blank text at an anchor outright, correctly: an anchor
 is where a rendering belongs, so writing nothing there would leave the passage
 missing while the run reported it delivered. That refusal landed in
 `publishFixedPage`, which runs BEFORE the artifact is written, so an entry
 whose translate lane had already recorded slice 12 unfilled three and a half
 hours earlier died at the last step with no artifact and no page kept.
 `translate-absence.ts` promises the opposite and owns the policy: one refused
 anchor costs its own slice rather than the entry. The refusal stays; what
 changes is that a slice deliberately left unfilled no longer presents itself
 to the splice as a blank rendering.
 
 READ OFF `incumbentKind` RATHER THAN OFF AN EMPTY INCUMBENT, per the same
 file: absence is a mode decided once from the target chunk, and testing the
 text would conflate an anchor with a content span whose archive wording
 genuinely is blank.
 
 @param artifact - settled entry, read for what each slice would carry
 
 @returns Replacement per slice that contributes one, in comparison order
 
 @example
 ```ts
 const replacements = shippableReplacements({ artifact, },);
 ```

/**
 Writes one settled entry's fixed English page into the mirrored tree.
 
 CALLED BEFORE THE ARTIFACT IS WRITTEN, and that ordering is the whole
 correctness argument rather than a preference. A pass builds its skip set
 from the artifacts already on disk, so "done" means exactly "an artifact
 exists". Publishing after the artifact would let a crash between the two
 leave an entry marked done forever with no page ever written; publishing
 before it makes "done implies published" true by construction, and a resumed
 pass skips an entry whose page is already there.
 
 BYTE-FAITHFUL, WITH NOTHING APPLIED HERE. The readings arrive as
 `wouldShipTextPerSlice` gives them: wrapped as the stage that settled them
 left them, in the archive's quote style, and with the page-assembly rows in
 place. Re-wrapping at this site would change
 text both deciders already approved, which is the defect already closed at the
 consolidation. Nothing normalizes the trailing newline either: the archive
 text is preserved byte for byte outside the slices that were replaced.
 
 @param artifact - settled entry, read for what each slice would carry
 
 @param slices - pairs this entry was prepared into, carrying the spans to write into
