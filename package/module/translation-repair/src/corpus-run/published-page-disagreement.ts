//region Published page disagreement
// The refusal a page earns when it does not carry what its artifact says would
// ship, composed here from counts and indices so the class can vouch for every
// character of its own message.
//
// A CLASS THAT FORWARDS A SENTENCE CANNOT CARRY THE MARKER: the inventory in
// `message-names-only.unit.test.ts` refuses one, because such a class cannot
// know what its caller wrote. Before this file the class took a finished
// `message`, documented that every caller wrote only slice indices and
// character counts, and went unmarked anyway, so the boundary muted it. Now the
// callers hand over the disagreement itself and the sentence is written here.
