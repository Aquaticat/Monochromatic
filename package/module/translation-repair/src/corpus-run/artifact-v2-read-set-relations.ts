//region Artifact version 2 set relations
// What has to hold between a lane's INDEX SETS, its counts, its status, and the
// ledger rows those describe.
//
// Each set is a second statement of something the ledger already says, and the
// ledger is the statement the writer checked against the document. So these are
// derived from the rows and compared, IN ORDER: both contracts say the sets are
// in document order, so an equal-length list in another order is a lane whose
// two derivations disagree, and a set read as a set would have thrown that away
// along with any repeated index.
//
// THE BLOCKED STATUS IS NOT RECOMPUTED, and cannot be. A blocked run and an
// unblocked one produce the same ledger whenever no slice decided anything
// different from the archive, so the derivation is not invertible and a reader
// claiming to recompute it would be refusing valid artifacts. What is checkable
// is COMPATIBILITY, which is what this file states.
