/**
 Tests for the refusals of `corpus-pass` that were wrong before its wiring
 moved out of its entry file, run as built: a limit that cannot be read, or a
 runs directory holding an artifact nothing can place, is a stated refusal at
 exit 6 with its message and no frames, and a ceiling of one minute is said in
 the singular.

 THE LIMITS: the cap and the spend ceiling were resolved while the file
 loaded, outside the refusal boundary, so an unreadable value exited 1 under
 Node's echo of the bundle's source line instead of exit 6. THE ARTIFACT
 GUARDS: their errors are plain errors that forward their message, so the
 command printed an operator's refusal as a fault in the command, at exit 5,
 with frames. THE CAP LINE wrote "1 minutes".

 Every child runs through `runBuiltWithoutKeys`, which removes every variable
 whose name ends in `_API_KEY` and every variable whose name starts
 `TRANSLATION_REPAIR_` before the case adds the scratch locations it needs.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
