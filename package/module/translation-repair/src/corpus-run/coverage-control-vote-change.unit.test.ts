/**
 Tests that the coverage control counts a case ONLY WHEN THE VOTE MOVED.

 WHAT THE CONTROL IS FOR. It exists to answer one question: can this wire vote
 absence at all? A roster that answers `full` to the undamaged passage and
 `full` again once the rendering it pointed at has been deleted has shown
 exactly nothing, and that is the reading the whole gate was built to refuse.

 WHAT WAS MEASURED. On 2026-08-25, relaxing the comparison that counts a case
 from `absentAfter > absentBefore` to `absentAfter >= absentBefore` failed no
 test in this package. Under that relaxation every damaged case counts as a
 case where the wire noticed, including one whose votes never moved, so a wire
 that cannot see damage reports a HELD control and licenses the null it was
 supposed to invalidate.

 COUNTED ON VOTES, NOT ON THE VERDICT KIND, which is what the field's own
 documentation says: the recorded null is about ballots rather than about how
 they were rolled up.

 NO NETWORK. Three kinds of scripted client stand in for the roster.

 The blind client (`coverageControlClient`, from the shared fixture) answers
 every round with full coverage, quoting a sentence really present, so the
 standing verdict carries, its evidence can be located and cut, and the answer
 after the cut is identical to the answer before it. That is a wire blind to
 damage, spelled out.

 The sheet-reading client (`sheetReadingClient`) answers each round by what
 the sheet carries: full coverage quoting the sentence while the judged
 rendering is on the sheet, none with an empty quote when it is not. One
 condition makes it follow the quoted sentence alone, a wire that sees the
 targeted damage and nothing else; the other makes it follow the whole page,
 a wire that sees any cut.

 The denying client answers every round that the passage is not carried at
 all, so the undamaged verdict never claims the passage.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
