/**
 Tests for seating judges that did not propose the claim they judge.
 
 The case that matters is the one that would produce a confident wrong
 number: a claim every seated model proposed, which must be reported rather
 than dropped. The rate renderer tested beside it had no caller after its
 runner changed and went on 2026-09-29 (ledger B30); the crosscheck runner
 reads `MIN_JUDGED_CLAIMS` itself.
 
 Model ids are the real roster, since the rule under test is about the
 relationship between authorship and the seats available. No corpus text is
 involved.
