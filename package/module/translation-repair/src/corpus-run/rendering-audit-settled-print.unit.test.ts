/**
 * Tests for how a persisted rendering audit reads on a terminal.
 *
 * THESE NUMBERS EXIST TO BE QUOTED INTO A DOCUMENT, which is what makes their
 * wording load-bearing rather than cosmetic. The module says so itself: a count
 * with no denominator is the single most quotable wrong number a telemetry probe
 * can emit. Every case below therefore asserts the denominator beside the count,
 * not just that a number reached the page.
 *
 * `printBand` CARRIES THE ONE REAL DECISION IN THE FILE. A band of zero over
 * zero pairs and a band of zero over forty pairs are opposite findings, and a
 * row of zeroes reads as the second. So an empty band says NOTHING PAIRED and
 * prints no numbers at all, and both halves of that get a case: the refusal must
 * appear, and the numbers must not.
 *
 * CAPTURING `console.log` IS PROCESS-WIDE, which is why this file runs at
 * `concurrency: 1`. `describe` runs children concurrently by default, and two
 * cases swapping the same reporter interleave: one reads lines a sibling wrote,
 * or reads none because a sibling already restored the real one. The runner
 * spawns a process per test file, so nothing outside this file is touched and
 * nothing inside it may overlap.
 *
