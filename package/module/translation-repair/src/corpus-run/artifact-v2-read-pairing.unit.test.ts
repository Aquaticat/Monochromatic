/**
 * Tests for reading the pairing a settled preparation was built on.
 *
 * WHAT THESE PIN is the difference between an artifact that records no pairing
 * and one that records an empty one, and the four shapes the reader refuses
 * because this pipeline cannot write them. Each refusal mirrors an invariant
 * `readBlockPairing` already holds over a roster reply, so a refusal that fired
 * on a shape the producer CAN emit would reject valid artifacts, which is the
 * failure these are pointed at rather than laxness.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
