//region Window trial order
// Which call position each arm gets, decided per slice rather than fixed.
//
// A FIXED ORDER ALIASES THE TREATMENT ONTO THE CLOCK. The arms of one slice are
// bought back to back, and the wide arm used to be third every time. Anything
// that drifts across those three calls, provider rate limiting biting after two
// rounds of six, a queue filling, a deadline growing more likely to be missed,
// lands entirely on the wide arm. Worse, it lands in the direction the trial
// predicts, because a degraded round declines and a decline keeps the archive.
//
// THE TWO NARROW ARMS CANNOT DETECT IT. They sit at two positions, and the wide
// arm sits at a third that neither of them ever occupies, so their difference
// bounds noise between positions one and two while saying nothing about position
// three. No statistic recovers this afterwards: the treatment and the position
// are the same variable.
//
// SO THE POSITION IS ASSIGNED PER SLICE, deterministically from the slice's own
// identity. Across the draw the wide arm sits first, second and last in roughly
// equal numbers, position effects average out instead of accumulating on one
// arm, and the rows carry the position so the effect can be estimated rather
// than assumed away. Deterministic rather than random so a resumed run, or a
// rerun for verification, assigns the same order to the same slice.
