// The question this serves is `#186`: does seating more EDITORS produce a
// better repair, holding the judging panel fixed. Two things make that harder
// to read than it looks.
//
// First, most slices will not move at all. The same strong editor tends to win
// both slates, and a width-three winner often survives the wider slate intact.
// A comparison that judged those against themselves would spend calls to learn
// nothing and would dilute whatever signal the moved slices carry, so they are
// classified out before any head-to-head runs.
//
// Second, a winner that changed is not yet a winner that improved. The lane
// disagrees with itself run to run, so the fraction of slices where the
// shipped text moved means nothing until the same arm RUN TWICE says how often
// it moves with no width change at all. That repeat re-produces as well as
// re-judges, because the width arms differ in production and a band covering
// only judge churn would credit ordinary editor variation to the extra seats.
