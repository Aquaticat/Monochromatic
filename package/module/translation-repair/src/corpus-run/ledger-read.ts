// READS THE JUDGED-CONTEST LEDGER BACK, and joins each ballot to the model it
// was about.
//
// THE OTHER HALF OF `candidate-ledger.ts`. Writing this half is what a writer
// needs to be trusted: the spend line looked finished until its reader was
// written, and writing the reader found two real defects in the writer.
//
// THE JOIN IS THE WHOLE POINT. A ballot names a POSITION, not a model. Nothing
// before this could say which model a judge was talking about when it explained
// why it did not pick something, which is exactly the evidence a roster
// question needs. `candidates[best - 1].producers` is that join, and it is
// one-based because the slate the judges saw was.
//
// A BALLOT NAMING NOTHING AND A BALLOT NAMING A CANDIDATE THAT DOES NOT EXIST
// ARE DIFFERENT, and neither is dropped. `SelectionBallot` says an index past
// the end is recorded rather than corrected, because a judge naming a candidate
// that is not there IS the finding. A reader that silently skipped either would
// report a cleaner contest than the one that happened.
//
// A MODEL'S OWN BALLOT FOR ITS OWN CANDIDATE IS NOT EVIDENCE ABOUT IT, and is
// counted separately, matching what `producer-standing.ts` does with the same
// rounds.
