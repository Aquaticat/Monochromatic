/**
 * Tests for the band ordering a corpus pass starts entries in.
 *
 * This module had no test at all, and it decides which entries a pass reaches
 * first. A defect here does not crash anything: it quietly fills one band
 * faster than the others, so the stratified sample drawn later is biased toward
 * whichever band the ordering favored, and the precision number the milestone
 * gate reads is measured on the wrong population.
 *
 * The rank offset is the subtle part and gets the most attention below. Without
 * it every run restarts each band at zero, the within-rank tiebreak hands every
 * run to the same band, and the starvation this ordering exists to prevent
 * comes back.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention.
