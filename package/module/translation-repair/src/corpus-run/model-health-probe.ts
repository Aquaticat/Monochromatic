//region Model health probe
// Asks ONE model for one trivial structured answer, and logs what came back.
//
// Built because `schema-mismatch, voice lost` is where three different faults
// arrive wearing one label: output truncated inside a thinking block, content
// that is not JSON at all, and JSON the caller's guard rejected. The client
// distinguishes them and says which at DEBUG level, which a corpus run does not
// record, so a run log shows a model failing and never says why.
//
// One model went from zero mismatches to 507 in four passes on unchanged code,
// across every role it holds. That is a property of the model or of how it is
// being asked, not of any stage, and the cheapest way to tell those apart is to
// ask it something a working model cannot get wrong.
//
// Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus text takes part, and this writes
// nothing.

/**
 Question every model is asked.

 Deliberately trivial. The point is not to test capability: any model that can
 hold a role in this pipeline can answer it, so a failure here is about the
 response FORMAT rather than about the task.
