//region Carried insertion fold
// THE PASSAGE BELONGS WITH ITS RENDERING. A carried insertion is a source-only
// slice whose English the roster found already on the page; where that
// English sits inside the archive span the pairing gave the NEIGHBOURING
// slice, the archive merged two originals into one rendering and the pairing
// left one of them unpaired. The lanes then write the neighbour from its own
// source alone: on mikaela12 (2026-09-24) the translate lane's judges rightly
// preferred the candidate without "the surrounding passage", the contest took
// it, and the guard at publish stopped the entry with the carried sentence
// gone (class one hundred ten). Folding the carried source into the carrier
// makes the pair honest, so both lanes render the passage as part of the
// slice that carries it; the folded slice stays an insertion the lanes skip,
// and leaves the guard, whose evidence the lanes may now reword.
//
// THE EVIDENCE MAY RUN INTO BOTH NEIGHBOURS. On mikaela13 (2026-09-24) the
// archive rendered the carried passage across the two paired slices around
// it (the HRT sentences inside the earlier span, "originally just a typical
// thing" as the later span's own line), the one ballot quoted both, and a
// fold that wanted one holder stood aside while the class one hundred seven
// stand-ins on both neighbours dropped the passage (class one hundred
// eleven). So the fold places the evidence block by block: every block must
// sit in a paired slice next to the carried one, and the carrier is the
// neighbour holding the larger share of the quoted text (the earlier on a
// tie), whose source must abut the carried source across blank space alone.
// The other neighbour keeps its own source; the words of the passage it
// rendered are the carrier's to write now.
//
// THE CARRIER'S SPAN MAY RENDER THE PASSAGE ALONE. On TianqiChen66611
// (2026-09-26) the pairing left one off and the plain fold made the carrier
// render its own source twice over; insertion-carried-shift.ts moves the
// carrier's own source to its far neighbour instead (class one hundred
// seventy-nine).
//
// EVERY STAND-ASIDE SAYS WHY, so a log reader can tell a passage the archive
// really scattered from one the fold could not place.
