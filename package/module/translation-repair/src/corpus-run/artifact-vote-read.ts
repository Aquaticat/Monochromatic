//region Artifact vote read
// Reads the two records a round keeps ABOUT VOTING: one ballot a judge cast, and
// what one slate position drew from all of them.
//
// Split out of `artifact-rounds-read.ts` when reading the whole round pushed that
// file past its line budget, and along the seam that was already there: nothing
// here knows what a round is, a stage is, or which outcome the round reached. A
// caller reading only ballots needs this file and none of that one.
//
// NEITHER READS A COUNT WHERE A WEIGHT BELONGS. A judge voting on its own work
// counts for half, so both a ballot's weight and a candidate's summed weight are
// routinely fractional, and a count guard would refuse records that are entirely
// well formed.
