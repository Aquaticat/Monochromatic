/**
 * Tests for the check that says a slice's surplus translation may have been read
 * out of a PICTURE rather than moved from its neighbour.
 *
 * WHAT THESE PIN is that the signal is the SAME component on both sides. Media
 * in the translation alone is content the original lacks; media in the original
 * alone is something the translation dropped. Only a shared component, with more
 * prose beside it on one side, says the prose came out of the image.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention mirroring corpus structure only.
