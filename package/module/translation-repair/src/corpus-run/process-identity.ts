//region Process identity
// WHICH PROCESS A PROCESS ID NAMED, not merely whether the id is in use (ledger
// A16). A pass killed at its hard cap leaves its lock behind, and the id the
// lock records is free for the kernel to hand to any later process; after a
// reboot the ids start again from the bottom. A lock judged by id alone then
// reads as held by whatever unrelated process now carries that id, and every
// later pass in the directory refuses, saying its holder is alive.
//
// A process is the id plus when it started. Linux says both: the boot it
// belongs to (`/proc/sys/kernel/random/boot_id`), the process-id namespace the
// id is counted in (`/proc/self/ns/pid`), and its start time in clock ticks
// since that boot (field twenty-two of `/proc/<pid>/stat`). Where `/proc` is
// absent the reads fail and the lock falls back to the id alone, saying so.
