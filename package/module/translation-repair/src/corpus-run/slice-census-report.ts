//region Slice census report
// What the corpus looks like AFTER slicing, measured rather than assumed, and
// spending no quota.
//
// Three questions need this and none of them could be answered from the code:
//
//   How many calls a translate lane costs, which is slices times producers, and
//   how large the largest of them is. `RUN_PER_CALL_TIMEOUT_MS` was tuned
//   against repair envelopes averaging 72 characters, and this lane sends whole
//   slices.
//
//   How much of the corpus reaches the lane as a section only ONE side carries,
//   which subdivision returns whole. Those are the calls that time out.
//
//   How much text sits in TARGET-ONLY blocks, the class where the English
//   carries something the Chinese markdown does not, letters held as images
//   being the known case. A translator working from the source has no source for
//   it, so whether it can be detected deterministically decides whether it can
//   be protected.
//
// The command is `slice-census.ts`; one entry's measure is
// `slice-census-entry.ts`; the gathering is `slice-census-gather.ts` and the
// lines are `slice-census-carve.ts`, `slice-census-unpaired.ts`,
// `slice-census-target-only.ts` and `slice-census-widest.ts`.

/**
 Measures every complete pair at the pin and prints the census.

 THE RUNS DIRECTORY IS RESOLVED AFTER THE CORPUS IS LISTED, as the command
 always did, so a clone that cannot be listed is the refusal an operator
 meets even where no runs directory resolves either.

 @param pin - corpus clone and commit to read

 @param resolveRuns - finds the runs directory whose settled artifacts carry
 each entry's recipe, passed in because the environment decides it

 @param readRecipe - reads one entry's settled recipe from that directory,
 passed in because it reads files

 @throws Whatever listing the corpus, resolving the runs directory, reading a
 recipe or measuring an entry throws, except the absence of one side of an
 entry

 @example
 ```ts
 await reportSliceCensus({ pin: RUN_CORPUS_PIN, resolveRuns: resolveRunsDir, readRecipe: readSettledRecipe, },);
 ```
