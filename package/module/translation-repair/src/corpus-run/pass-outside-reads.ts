// Exa key the suite had inherited, bought a web search for the invented
// title, and wrote the result into the real lookup cache. A seam a caller may
// leave out is a seam a test forgets; a required one is a type error until

 Outside reads over one environment, transport and corpus: the web through

 Every input that reaches past the process is REQUIRED, as the readers
 themselves are of their callers (ledger X19, M68), so a test builds these
 readers only by naming its own transport, cache directory and corpus.

 @param env - environment the key and the cache directory are read from, at each read

 @param fetchFn - transport both web readers buy through

 @param pin - corpus checkout and commit the names are read at

 @param listPeople - entry lister at the pin

 @param readFile - document reader at the pin

 @param now - clock a new lookup record is stamped with; the wall clock unless a test fixes it

 @returns Readers for one preparation's outside reads
