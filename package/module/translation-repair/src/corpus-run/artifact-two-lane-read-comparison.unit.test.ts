/**
 Tests for the reader's check of the comparison an artifact carries, at the
 level it is written rather than through a whole artifact.

 WHY NOT THROUGH THE READER: the reader parses every delivery row into a fresh
 object before this check runs, so a row that fails while being read cannot
 reach it from a file, and the case that a failure other than the
 comparison's own refusal passes through unchanged needs exactly that row.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
