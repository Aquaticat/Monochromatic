/**

 * WHY THIS SITS APART from `artifact-pool-refusal.unit.test.ts`: `await
 * describe` throws, so two suites in one file cannot both be read by a single
 * GFP round, and each of these pins a different decision.
 *
 * WHAT IT PINS is that the line carries the entry COUNT beside the abbreviated
 * digest. Measured on 2026-08-25, dropping the count failed no case: the
 * listing still named every generation and still read as a report, while the
 * reader lost the one number the refusal exists to offer.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
