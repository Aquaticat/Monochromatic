//region Relocation pairing
// The `#107` reading rule, in code.
//
// WHAT `#107` SAYS: per-slice judging cannot tell a RELOCATION from a
// fabrication. A passage the archive carried across a slice boundary is missing
// from the slice it belonged to and present in a slice that does not account
// for it, so one move is reported twice: as an omission on one slice and as an
// unsupported addition on its neighbour. Counting both condemns the archive for
// doing something reasonable.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES ABOUT IT: names the pairs. It does NOT subtract them from any
// tally. Nothing here can tell a real relocation from a genuine omission that
// happens to sit beside a genuine addition, and a rule that silently removed
// both would be the same defect in the other direction: an instrument that
// cannot see a class of damage.
//
// FIXED BEFORE THE NUMBERS EXISTED, while the full run was still buying its
// subjects. Adjacency is ONE slice, and it is one because a moved passage lands
// next door; widening it after seeing a tally would let the rule absorb
// whatever it needed to absorb.
