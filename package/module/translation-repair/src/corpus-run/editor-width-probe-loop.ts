// SPENDS THE DRAW, one slice at a time, printing a line for each and
// rewriting the report after every one.

/**
 Runs the drawn slices at both widths and writes the report as they settle.

 Sequential by design: every arm of every slice must meet the same provider
 conditions, which fanning the draw out would destroy, and the run is bounded
 by quota rather than by wall time.

 @param client - client every call goes through

 @param drawn - slices this run spends

 @param narrowEditorIds - seats of the narrow arm

 @param wideEditorIds - seats of the wide arm

 @param judgeModelIds - panel held fixed

 @param signal - cancellation shared by every call

 @param l - logger

 @param controlHeld - whether the panel passed the positive control, which
 the report states

 @param draw - half of the sample these slices came from

 @param headSha - pipeline commit the rows were produced by, read before the
 draw so the report can be republished from inside the loop

 @param gather - finds a slice's work for the editors, or why it has none

 @param runSlice - runs one slice at both widths

 @param writeReport - writes the report over the rows so far

 @example
 ```ts
 await runWidthDraw({ client, drawn, narrowEditorIds, wideEditorIds, judgeModelIds, signal, l, controlHeld, draw, headSha, gather, runSlice, writeReport, },);
