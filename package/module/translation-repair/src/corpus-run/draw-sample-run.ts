// Reads every settled artifact, bands each entry by its zh source bytes,
// flattens accepted issues into grading candidates, and draws the stratified
// precision sample into a grading sheet written OUTSIDE the repo (the sheet
// quotes UNLICENSED corpus text). Default run is PRELIMINARY validation over
// whatever has settled; pass `--final` once every band has enough CONTRIBUTING
// entries to spread the draw, and only once the pass writing artifacts has
// stopped, since a live run can add one after the directory is read. Readiness
// is judged on contributing entries rather than accepted counts because the
// draw round-robins across entries. A preliminary run draws with a different
// seed on purpose, so repeated previews can never become a way of choosing the
// gate sample. The reconcile in `draw-entry-load.ts` aborts loudly if a parsed accepted count
// disagrees with the artifact's own tally, so the sample is never silently
// short.
