/**
 Tests for the report over a persisted rendering audit, and for both CLIs at
 their boundary.

 NO CASE REACHED THESE BEFORE. `readRunRows` decides what a report is a
 report of, `newestRun` decides which run is meant when none is named, and
 `printAcross` is the only across-run reading; each is exported through the
 barrel for exactly this. The two commands are then run as built, against
 throwaway runs and an empty archive, so the refusal policy rendering-7 set
 (a stated refusal exits 6 with its line and no frames) is proved at the
 boundary an operator meets rather than at the throw.

 DISPOSABLE FIXTURES ONLY: every run is written under its own `mkdtemp`
 directory, in the shape the probe store writes, and nothing here reads a
 real run.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
