// CLASS ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-FOUR (hulicaijia19, 2026-09-25): the page is
// Canadian English, which writes a date month first ("April 29", "March 13,
// 2024"), yet the archive's "29th April" and "On 4 May" stood beside the
// bench's "March 13" on one page. Every date in the text's prose is read and
// written month first, its month in full, with no ordinal suffix, and with its
// year set off by commas on both sides.
//
// The audit of 2026-09-26 (ledger K1, K2, K4, K8) found the first pass wrote
// "March 13, 2024 in a box" with no closing comma, left a day-first date
// after "until", "to" or a dash, split "1st\nto 3rd June", mixed the orders of
// "3 June to 5 July", left "December 29th", "2023 Feb 25th" and "4 Sept
// 2024", wrote "the May 4" from "the 4th May", and rewrote "5 May beetles"
// and "4 May2024". The readers in `canadian-date-read.ts` and
// `canadian-date-read-leading.ts` read each shape whole instead.
