//region Recall benchmark run
// Measures what precision cannot see: of the defects that ARE present, how many
// does the pipeline find, and how many does it actually repair.
//
// Precision is measured on the pipeline's own output, so a pipeline that
// accepts almost nothing scores beautifully and repairs nothing. This runner
// plants known omissions into a clean translation, runs the whole repair loop
// on the seeded pair, and grades restoration against the deletions it made, so
// the denominator is defects that certainly exist rather than defects the
// pipeline chose to report.
//
// Run with `mise run //package/module/translation-repair:recall-benchmark`
// (append `-- --plan` for a zero-quota setup check).

 Raised from 4 on run 001's own timing: it settled seven of nine entries in

 has to be re-measured anyway after the slice-index fix, and the rerun also
 carries the ensemble and the naturalness lane, both of which only add wall
 time, so a four-hour budget would lose more than two entries next time.
 Coverage is the thing this protects; the plan is flat rate, so a longer run
 costs nothing but waiting.
