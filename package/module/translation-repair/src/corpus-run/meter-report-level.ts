 TWO ENDS RATHER THAN ONE. The last reading answers what the budget is now;
 the first says which way it moved to get there, which is the difference
 between a budget this run drained and one that was empty before it started.

 SAYS SO WHEN NOTHING WAS RECORDED. A run written before the levels were
 added carries states and no numbers, and silence there would read as a
 provider whose meter never said anything.
