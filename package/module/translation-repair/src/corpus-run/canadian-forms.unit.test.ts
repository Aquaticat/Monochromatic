 Guards class one hundred thirty-four (hulicaijia19, 2026-09-25): the page is
 Canadian English (class one hundred thirty-two), yet it carried "On 4 May"
 and "29th April" beside "March 13", and "liquorice" where Canadian writes
 "licorice", because the archive's day-first dates and British spellings
 stood on slices no lane rewrote. The page-assembly pass writes every date
 month first and respells a closed list of words, on every slice, outside
 markup, links, code, comments and the sealed English original.

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
