// ("29th April", "On 4 May") and its "liquorice" stood on slices no lane
// rewrote, beside the bench's "March 13". The sheets tell the bench, but
// nothing reads a slice the lanes never replaced. This page-assembly pass
// reads every slice as the page will carry it and writes its dates month
// first and a closed list of words the Canadian way, outside markup, links,
// code and comments. The front matter is published as the archive has it,
// and a span sealed as the English original is carried byte for byte, so
