//region Dropped destinations
// WHAT THE SOURCE LINKS TO THAT THE PAGE NO LONGER DOES.
//
// The naturalness lane protects link destinations as ordered atoms, so a
// rewrite cannot drop one. Nothing protected them across the other two ways a
// slice ships: the repair lane keeping an archive sentence that never carried
// the link, and the contest preferring the incumbent. The 2026-08-26 reading
// (`doc/audit/translation-repair-output-reading-20260826.md`) found a page
// that had lost a source hyperlink exactly that way, with nothing having
// noticed. This is the document-level check that notices.
//
// TWO READERS, UNIONED. Markdown destinations come off the tree the pipeline
// itself parses (front matter split, invisible lines and HTML comments masked,
// strict MDX with the plain-markdown downgrade), which also covers reference
// definitions; bare runs come off a linear scan for the two web schemes, which
// also covers front matter and HTML attributes, over the text with its HTML
// comments masked (class forty-six, shi_Yumiaoya1, 2026-09-17: the original
// carried a profile link inside a comment, every stage masks comments, and the
// page was refused for dropping a destination no reader could follow). A
// destination is a string; two
// spellings of one address that differ only by a trailing slash are treated as
// the same address, because that difference changes nothing a reader can
// follow.
//
// AN EXPLICIT DESTINATION IS FOLLOWED AS WRITTEN. Only an address prose ran
// into, a bare run the scanner reads or an autolink literal the tree builds,
// is cut at its first stopper and shed of sentence punctuation; a destination
// written between parentheses, angle brackets or after a definition's label
// ends where its author ended it. Cut too, two explicit links that differ only
// past a full-width comma read as one, and a page keeping either was taken
// for keeping both. The scanner still reads such a destination's address off
// the raw text and stops at that comma, so the union can carry the explicit
// destination beside the scanner's shorter run of it, on every side alike.
//
// THE EMPTY STRING IS NO DESTINATION. A link written with nothing between its
// parentheses names nowhere a reader could follow, so neither side carries
// one for it and no page owes it; recorded, it compared equal to every other
// destination the trimming emptied, and `traceDroppedDestinations` found it in
// every slice, the shipped text included, since every text holds the empty
// string. A destination that carries something never reads as the empty
// string: an explicit one stands as written, and the trim of an address prose
// ran into never empties it (`trimDestination`).
//
// THE SITE'S OWN GRAMMAR IS NOT THIS ONE. The corpus repo compiles a page with
// MDX 3 and remark-math after rewriting HTML comments into JSX comments
// (`scripts/build.ts`, `scripts/mdx.ts` there); reconciling the
// two is open. For destinations the difference does not matter: a link is a link under
// both, and the bare-run scan catches what either tree would not.
//
// THE ARCHIVE'S RENDERING COUNTS. Where the archive rendered a reference
// another way than the original, the page owes one rendering from either
// side (`destination-renderings.ts`, the owner's decision of 2026-09-04);
// a reader that compared the page to the source alone refused the luxuanwen3
// page every slice had passed. Without an archive the source alone governs.
//
// A DROPPED DESTINATION IS STRUCTURED EVIDENCE. Production checks this result
// before writing and pauses as an invariant if stage-local translation failed
// to restore a source destination. Reporting tools may still read all fields.

 ONE LINEAR PASS. `nextSchemeStart` searches forward from the cursor for where
 a scheme starts, the run is read from there to its first stopper, and the

 run, for a scheme the text lacks (`scheme-start-scan.ts` holds the

 opened). `Tabby_(cat)` is one address, so a page writing it bare and a source
 linking it explicitly name one destination; a `)` that balances none, as the
 one closing a parenthesis set around the address, still ends it.

 end, as the parse's trail rule reads it (`tokenizeTrail`): `(see Tabby_(cat).)`

/**
 Address as a reader would follow it where prose ran into it: cut at the first
 stopper, trailing sentence punctuation shed.

 A GFM autolink literal runs until whitespace, so in Chinese prose it swallows
 the full-width comma or stop after the address; the scanner never does, and
 the two readers must agree on the address or the union counts one link twice.

 ONLY AN ADDRESS PROSE RAN INTO COMES HERE: a scanned run, which opens where
 `nextSchemeStart` found a scheme, and an autolink literal, whose destination
 the parse writes as the address it read when that opens with its scheme, and
 with `http://` or `mailto:` put before a `www.` address or an email address
 (`mdast-util-gfm-autolink-literal`). Both open on a letter, which neither
 the cut nor the shed removes, so neither is ever emptied. An explicit
 destination never comes here: emptied, `.`, `..` and a destination opening
 on a stopper read as one empty string (ledger B139), and cut, two that
 differ past a stopper read as one.

 @param url - address as the scan or an autolink literal produced it
