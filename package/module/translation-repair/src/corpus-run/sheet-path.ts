//region Grading sheet path
// Decides where a grading sheet is written, and refuses to write over one that
// may already carry human grades.
//
// The hazard this exists to remove is concrete rather than theoretical. Round
// one's sheet was written to a fixed `grading-sheet.md`, the user graded it IN
// PLACE, and 24 of its 50 items came back carrying free-text rationale that no
// other file reproduces (the gate verdict records the Y/N tally, not the
// reasoning). Drawing round two through the same fixed name would have silently
// destroyed all of it, and a draw is exactly the routine command someone runs
// without thinking twice.
//
// Two independent defenses, because either alone still loses data. Naming the
// sheet after its draw seed means two rounds cannot target one path at all;
// refusing to overwrite means that even a repeated draw within ONE round, or a
// seed someone reuses by accident, cannot clobber grading already done.
// Preliminary sheets are exempt from the refusal: they are ungraded scratch
// that is meant to be redrawn as the pool grows.
