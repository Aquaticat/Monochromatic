/**
 Guards class one hundred seventy-three (TianqiChen6668, 2026-09-26): the
 archive sets an anime's title in italics, yet the page wrote the same words
 in curly quotes, broken across two lines after the colon, so the page named
 a work in a form the archive never used. The page-assembly pass reads the
 archive's italic spans and, where the page quotes the same words in prose,
 restores the italic form, moving a period or comma the quotes held outside.

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
