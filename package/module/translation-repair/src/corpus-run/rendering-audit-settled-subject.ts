// SPLIT OUT OF THE INPUT MODULE when the page relation arrived and pushed that
// file past its line budget. The seam was already there: walking an archive,
// checking provenance and reading a file are one job, and turning one lane's
// delivery ledger into subjects is another. Splitting was the remedy rather
// than raising the cap.
//
// EVERY SUBJECT NAMES BOTH QUESTIONS. The lane-scoped fields say what the
// judges really decided, which is what the audit reads; `pageRelation` says
// whether a later stage overruled it. Neither is a default, for the reason
// `rendering-audit-settled-relation.ts` gives.

 nothing.
