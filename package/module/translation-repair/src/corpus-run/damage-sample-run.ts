//region Damage sample run
// Draws shipped regions at random and asks a human the SAME source-anchored
// question the probe now asks, so the two answers are comparable.
//
// Every earlier repair measurement failed on one of two counts. The round-three
// repair sheet asked whether the returned wording fixed its issue, which is a
// different question from whether the edit damaged anything. The verification
// sheet asked the right question but drew only regions someone already believed
// were bad, and re-reading those five showed all five were correct repairs, so
// the selection carried the answer.
//
// This draws from every shipped region in the settled artifacts, by seed, with
// no reference to what anyone thought of them. The probe's verdict is recorded
// in the manifest and NEVER on the sheet: a reader shown a machine claim is
// answering a different question, and agreement measured that way is worthless.

 @param openClient - builds the client one region's probe asks through: `createRunClient` in a run, called once per region and never for a pool with nothing to draw
