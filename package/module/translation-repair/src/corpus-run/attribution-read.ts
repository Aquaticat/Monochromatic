// ONE KEY IS TOLERANT OF ABSENCE, and only one: the critic record
// (`sliceCritics`/`chunkCritics`), because an artifact settled before
// attribution existed carries no such key at all, and that absence is DATA
// rather than a fault. The report counts those entries separately instead of
// reading them as critics that raised nothing.
//
// EVERY OTHER FIELD HERE IS REQUIRED, because every generation that has ever
// settled an artifact writes it: `id`, `issues`, an issue record, its `issue`,
// its `status`, its `claims`, a claim's `claimId`, and, from version 2 on,
// `lanes`, `lanes.repair` and `lanes.repair.result`. For these, absence is not
// a legacy reading, it is the same corruption a wrong shape is, and both are
// refused the same way: `ArtifactParseError` naming the path.

/**
 Record carrying this artifact's own attribution and issue records.
 
 TWO PATHS, AND EXACTLY ONE PER ARTIFACT, CHOSEN BY THE ARTIFACT'S OWN
 GENERATION rather than guessed from what keys happen to be there. Version 1
 wrote the critic record and `issues` at the artifact root and carried no
 `lanes` key at all; version 2 onward writes them inside the repair lane at
 `lanes.repair.result`, root-level decoys included, and a reader that still
 asked the root would silently agree with one.
 
 Measured, before this held, over the settled artifacts: 0 of 47 carried
 `chunkCritics` at the root and 47 of 47 carried it in the repair lane, so the
 whole population was filed as pre-feature and the 2479 attributions it held
 reached no consumer. The issue read failed the same way, 0 records against
 1546.
 
 The version 1 path stays rather than being replaced, because artifacts
 outlive the pipelines that wrote them and a settled file must keep answering
 for itself. A `lanes` key on a version 1 or unversioned artifact is refused
 rather than read: that generation never wrote one, so its presence is
 corruption rather than a two-lane artifact caught early.

 repair lane's own result
