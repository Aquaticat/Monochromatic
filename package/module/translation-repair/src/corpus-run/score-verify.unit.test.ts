/**
 Tests for the `score-verify` runner: the built command over a runs directory
 a case wrote.

 The runner reads a graded sheet and its manifest and prints one line per set,
 so its as-built cases run to the end of the report on a fixture and read the
 whole of what it printed. Every child is started by `runBuiltScore`, whose
 environment carries no variable ending in `_API_KEY`.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
