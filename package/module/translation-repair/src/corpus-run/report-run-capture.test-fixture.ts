// A report prints with `console.log` and may set `process.exitCode`, and both
// are process-wide. This diverts the first through the calling case's own
// sandbox and puts the second back to what it was however the report ends, so
// a case that drives a report never decides the suite's own exit. A case that
// calls it sits in a suite that runs one case at a time: the exit code is shared
// by every case of the file.
