/**
 Tests for what the spend report says about a priced tally.

 EACH SECTION IS CHECKED PRESENT AND ABSENT. The metered seats, the seats no
 price covered, the USD seats, the subscription seats and the floor of calls
 that reported no usage each print only when the tally holds them, so a case
 hands `printCost` a tally holding one section and asserts the whole text.

 A SECTION NAMES WHAT IT HOLDS. The USD seats are OpenRouter's and Bedrock's,
 and the heading and the total name the providers the seats came from, since a
 Bedrock seat printed under OpenRouter's name sends a reader to the wrong
 invoice. A report of no priced seat says why: no metered call at all, or
 metered calls on seats no row of the price table covers.

 EVERY COUNT NOUN, VERB AND PRONOUN AGREES WITH ITS COUNT, shown at one and at
 several.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
