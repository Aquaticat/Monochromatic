/**
 Tests for writing an artifact no concurrent reader can catch half-written.

 The window is small and the consequence is a silently wrong denominator: a
 partial file is classified as malformed, the pool keeps malformed files on
 purpose so the reader that reports them still sees them, and a later reader
 parses the now-complete file and counts it without the generation checks it
 should have faced.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
