/**
 * Tests for the two git questions the pool asks, on throwaway repositories.
 *
 * WHY THROWAWAY REPOSITORIES. `resolveCommit` and `tipContains` ask git, and
 * the only suite that reached them before asked about this repository's own
 * root and HEAD, which can never produce the two failures worth a test: a
 * shallow history and a commit git does not know. Both are built here from
 * nothing, in `mkdtemp` directories, as three empty commits and a `--depth 2`
 * clone of them. Nothing here reads the pinned corpus clone or this worktree,
 * and the identity every commit is written under is passed per call, so the
 * fixtures never read this machine's git configuration.
 *
 * THE SHALLOW GUARD IS THE ONE WORTH A TEST. `git merge-base --is-ancestor`
 * exits 1 both for "not an ancestor" and for "history stops before the answer",
 * so in a shallow clone a clean negative would quietly drop every entry produced
 * before the cut while every rate above the pool looked ordinary. Measured
 * before these were written, on exactly this fixture: in the depth-2 clone,
 * asking whether the second commit contains the third exits 1 and
 * `rev-parse --is-shallow-repository` prints true; in the full clone the same
 * question exits 1 and the flag prints false; an invented id exits 128 in both.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
