//
// TEST SUPPORT, NOT PACKAGE SOURCE. No child is started here. A case starts
// its child with `runBuiltCommand` of `child-environment.test-fixture.ts`,
// which removes every provider key and every setting of the package from the
// child's environment, so a case can read what the real command prints and how
// it exits without any chance of a call leaving the machine, whatever the
// parent's own environment holds.

/**
 The whole stderr a runner leaves when it reaches its first call with no

 `reportingRefusals` prints it.

 @param command - name of the built runner, which starts the line

 @returns The refusal line with its newline

 ```ts
