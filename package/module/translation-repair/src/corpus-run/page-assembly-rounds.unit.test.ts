/**
 Tests for when the page-assembly rounds run again (ledger K5, T8).

 A ROUND RUNS AGAIN ONLY FOR A SLICE NO EARLIER ROUND TOOK BACK. Two page
 passes rewrite the archive's text on every slice, so a later round can
 carry a pass-made row at a slice whose lane row an earlier round withdrew;
 were its guard to take that row back, every later round would make and lose
 it again. Until 2026-09-29 that round threw and stopped the entry's page;
 it now settles, the slice staying withdrawn. No fixture is known to reach
 that round through the real passes, so these cases drive the rule the loop
 runs on over plain rounds.
