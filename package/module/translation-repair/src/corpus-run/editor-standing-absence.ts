/**
 The line a report prints when nothing it read carried a judged round.

 THREE DIFFERENT ABSENCES, each named: artifacts settled under an earlier
 roster, rounds recorded that drew no ballot, and no round recorded at all.

 @param offRoster - artifacts naming a model the roster no longer seats,
 which say why the current roster has nothing to read

 @param unjudged - rounds the readings recorded, none of which drew a ballot
 since no digest carried a judged one

 @returns One line naming which of the three absences it was, since each has
 its own remedy

 @example
 ```ts
 console.log(noJudgedRoundLine({ offRoster: 0, unjudged: 1, },),);
 ```
