/**
 * Tests for what has to hold between a lane's index sets, counts, status and
 * the ledger rows those describe.
 *
 * THESE ARE ALL REFUSAL BRANCHES, and a valid artifact reaches none of them.
 * `parseSettledArtifactV2` calls every one of these on its way through a file,
 * so the suite already ran them thousands of times, always down the arm where
 * nothing was wrong. That is coverage of the caller and not of these: the
 * question each answers is what it does with a lane whose two derivations
 * disagree, and no valid fixture can ask it.
 *
 * WHY ORDER RATHER THAN MEMBERSHIP. Both contracts say the index lists are in
 * document order, so an equal-length list in another order is a lane whose two
 * derivations disagree, and a check that read them as sets would call that
 * agreement. Two cases pin the ordering, and one pins a repeated index, which
 * a set would also have swallowed.
 *
 * WHY BLOCKED COMPATIBILITY RUNS ONE WAY. A blocked run and an unblocked one
 * produce the same ledger whenever no slice decided anything different from
 * the archive, so the status is not derivable from the rows and a check that
 * recomputed it would refuse valid artifacts. Three cases accept ledgers that
 * a recomputation would have rejected.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
