//region Artifact rounds read
// Reads judged repair rounds back out of an artifact's raw lane result.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT THE VERSION 2 PARSER'S JOB. `ParsedLane` deliberately hands
// back the lane's `result` as an unread record and checks only the core version
// 2 requires, saying in its own note that a reader wanting a field this version
// does not check should take it from the artifact. Rounds are such a field.
// Taking them means checking them here, because nothing else has.
//
// IT REFUSES AN ARTIFACT FROM AN OLDER ROSTER, by way of
// `artifact-producer-read.ts`, which names a departed model rather than reading
// it as current. That refusal is the point; the note there says why.
//
// A ROUND IS ALL-OR-NOTHING. Half a slate is worse evidence than none, because
// a standing divides by the ballots it saw and a dropped candidate moves every
// share on the round.
//
// A RESULT WITH NO `chunks` AT ALL IS ITS OWN ANSWER, not a malformed one. The
// repair lane recorded rounds only from a later build, so an artifact settled
// before that carries a complete, correct result that simply predates the field.
// Found by running the reader over the archives: 22 of 41 artifacts were absent
// this field and every one of them records `status: repaired`. Reporting those
// as parse failures would say 22 records are broken when none is, and would
// understate how much evidence a reader could hope to find.
