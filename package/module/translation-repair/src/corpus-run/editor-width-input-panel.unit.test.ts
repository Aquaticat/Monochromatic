/**
 * Tests that the width probe REFUSES a slice whose panel accepted nothing.
 *
 * WHY THIS MATTERS. The repair lane edits accepted issues and nothing else, so
 * a slice whose critics filed claims the panel then threw out has no work in it
 * either. It looks different from a silent slice, though: claims were filed, a
 * panel round was bought, and the only thing separating the two is what the
 * panel decided. The refusal has to name THAT, because a reader of the probe's
 * rows is trying to tell a corpus with nothing wrong in it from a critic roster
 * whose claims never survive adjudication, and those are opposite findings.
 *
 * WHAT WAS MEASURED. On 2026-08-25, inverting the test that keeps only accepted
 * issues, so REJECTED ones are the ones an envelope may be cut from, failed no
 * test in this package. Under that inversion this slice stops being refused for
 * the reason it was refused, and the probe reports the wrong wall.
 *
 * NO NETWORK. The critics file one anchorable claim and every panelist votes it
 * unsupported. Any other stage is refused by name, so a guard that let rejected
 * issues through would be caught reaching for the editors.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
