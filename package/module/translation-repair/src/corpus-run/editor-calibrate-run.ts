//region Editor calibrate run
// WHICH OF THE ROSTER SHOULD EDIT, measured on the editor's own job.
//
// `producer-calibrate.ts` seated the three writers, and its instrument drives
// `runTranslateStage`: a model writing English from Chinese, with nothing in
// front of it but the source. An editor does something else. It is handed
// archive text, a set of adjudicated claims against it, and a window of
// neighbouring prose, and asked to repair what the claims name without
// disturbing what they do not. Seating an editor on a writer's standing is one
// step removed from the job, and this closes that step.
//
// IT DRIVES THE LANE RATHER THAN REPLAYING IT. `ChunkRepairOutcome.rounds`
// already carries every slate judges saw with each candidate's producer
// attached, plus every ballot, which is what a standing counts.
// `repair-selection-rounds.ts` re-shapes it. So the critics, the panel and the
// window are all real: the claims an editor works from here are claims models
// actually raised about that passage, not fixtures.
//
// EVERY MODEL EDITS EVERY SLICE, for the reason the writer calibration gives:
// a narrow slate compares only the models that happened to be seated, and a
// standing then means something different for each of them.
//
// CHECKERS SELF-CERTIFY HERE, AND ONLY HERE. Production forbids a checker from
// proving its own repair, so a full editor roster leaves nobody independent to
// check, whatever the roster's width (eight when this was written, nine since
// 2026-09-01). The alternative is rotating editors out, which
// re-introduces the survivorship the shape exists to avoid. The trade is safe
// for THIS measurement because checking runs after selection: a standing reads
// the envelope and chunk-patch ballots, which are cast before any checker is
// asked. What self-certification can move is how many rounds happen, not who
// won the ones that did.
//
// IT RUNS THE NATURALNESS LANE TOO, so the refiner seat is measured rather
// than assumed. `repairChunk` does NOT reach it: it takes `refinerModelIds`
// only to compute the union of models it must seat, sets `refined: false`, and
// returns. Refinement is a separate stage the document driver runs afterwards.
// This was found live, by a nine-slice run reporting zero refiner rounds and no
// refine activity in its log at all, against a module note here claiming the
// refiner standing came off the same spend. It did not; it now does.
//
// THE REFINER SEAT WAS RESEATED ON THE SAME WRITING EVIDENCE the editor seat
// was, so it is exactly as unmeasured, and leaving it that way while measuring
// the seat beside it would answer half the question this runner exists for.
//
// EMPTY DEFINITIONS, honestly. A drawn slice has no document-level glossary
// block behind it, so there is nothing to pass; that is a real value here, not
// an absence dressed as one.
//
// THE TWO SEATS ARE CREDITED SEPARATELY, which takes work because the lane
// unions them. `collectRefinedAuthors` merges the editors with any refiner
// whose rewrite won, so the refined outcome's authorship names both seats in
// one list that cannot be split back apart. The editor column is therefore read
// off the accuracy lane's own outcome, and the refiner column off
// `settleRefinedSlice`'s `refinedBy`.
//
// WHO IS MISSING FROM EACH TABLE IS REPORTED TOO, by `producer-silence.ts`, and
// the two reasons are separated rather than lumped: a model its provider
// refused wrote nothing, while a model whose wording every peer proposed word
// for word shipped without a ballot. The first is evidence nobody bought yet
// and the second is evidence already paid for.
//
// SPENDS QUOTA, and more per slice than the writer calibration does: a whole
// repair lane rather than one stage. Point `TRANSLATION_REPAIR_RUNS_DIR` at a
// throwaway directory.
//
// WHAT THE PROCESS HANDS IN, because this module reads neither the environment
// nor the command line itself: the overlap dial, the corpus draw, the two
// straggler windows and the client are each a function the entry file passes,
// called at the point of the run where the command used to reach for it, so
// the order of the output and of the refusals is the order the command had.
