// FAILURE TEXT FOR A STDOUT LINE. A class that declared its message quote-free
// says it, anything else is named and not quoted, since stdout is read,
// grepped, and pasted; capped after that so one runaway message
// cannot swallow the line a reader counts by.
//
// A CORPUS READ'S KIND AND REMEDY ARE NEVER CUT. The cap applies to what
// precedes them, the path and revision asked for, and the closing follows
// whole: it is one of four fixed sentences, so it cannot run away. Until
// 2026-10-06 a long entry id or picture name pushed the remedy, and for a
// longer one the kind, past the cap, and the line told the reader neither
// what was wrong nor what to do.
//
// A CUT OPENING ENDS ON A MARK (`CUT_MARK`), inside the cap, so a path cut
// short never reads as a whole one followed by advice to check it.
