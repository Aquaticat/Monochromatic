/**
 Tests for the warnings `score-attribution` prints beside its counts.

 Each warning prints nothing for a zero count, and each states its count with
 the noun, verb and pronoun that agree with it, so a case holds the zero, the
 one and the several of each.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
