// What the roster settled at each slice where the two lanes offer different
// wording, as the settled artifact records it.
//
// WHY THE VERDICT IS A KIND RATHER THAN THE STAGE`S RAW `choice`. The contest
// answers `neither` in two unrelated situations: a roster that heard enough
// voices and still backed no candidate, and a roster too few of whose voices
// arrived to settle anything at all. Recording the raw answer would merge them,
// so a reader asking how often the contest refused both lanes would be counting
// silence as refusal. They are kept apart here, and an unsettled slice lands on
// the same footing as a win, ballots included, for the same reason the repair
// lane records its declined rounds.
