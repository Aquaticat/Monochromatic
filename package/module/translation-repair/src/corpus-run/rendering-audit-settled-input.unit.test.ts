/**
 Tests for turning an archive of settled artifacts into audit subjects.

 What matters here is not that the reader parses. It is that every claim a
 persisted audit row will later make about its own provenance is true: that
 the text audited is the text the judges saw, that the corpus commit read is
 the artifact's own rather than whatever the pin says today, that a retained
 slice is marked as the archive's wording rather than a fresh rendering, and
 that a preparation which no longer matches is REPORTED rather than thrown.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention on a throwaway git repository. No corpus
 content appears here.
