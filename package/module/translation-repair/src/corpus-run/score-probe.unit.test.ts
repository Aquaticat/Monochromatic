/**
 Tests for the map that joins a graded sheet position to a probe verdict.

 This is the join the gate's probe comparison rests on: sheet position to
 issue id through the manifest, then issue id to reading here. A wrong answer
 does not fail, it mislabels, and every count downstream still looks ordinary.

 The defect this pins was live. The map used to be built from each reading's
 `regions[].issueIds`, which names every issue a region serves, and one
 replacement can serve several accepted issues. A shared envelope therefore
 appeared in the readings of every record it served, and the last one indexed
 won. Ownership now comes from the record itself.
