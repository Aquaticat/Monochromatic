// A slice whose ORIGINAL is structure rather than prose, which `#107` names as
// a known false donor.
//
// WHY IT MATTERS TO THE DISPLACEMENT SCREEN. That screen calls a slice a
// relocation candidate when a high-ratio slice sits beside a below-baseline
// neighbour, reading the pair as a passage that moved from one to the other. A
// slice that is entirely a photo component or an image block sits at a ratio
// near 1.00 whatever the translator did, because the same markup appears
// verbatim on both sides. It is below baseline for a reason that has nothing to
// do with giving text up, so it pairs with any high neighbour and always will.
//
// IT IS NAMED, NOT SUPPRESSED, which is this instrument's rule throughout: size
// cannot deliver a verdict, so every reading here says where to look. A reader
// subtracting a named subset knows what was subtracted; a screen that silently
// dropped pairs would report a smaller number nobody could audit.
