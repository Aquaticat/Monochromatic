//region Score verify run
// Joins the blind verification grades to the manifest that says which set each
// item came from, and reports what the unlabelled probe's flags are worth.
//
// The join is BY POSITION, the same as every other sheet here, because the
// sheet prints no ids on purpose. The manifest is written in the same instant
// as the sheet by `probe-verify.ts`, from one ordering, so position is exact
// rather than assumed.
//
// What the numbers mean. A flag on a region a reader already called damaged is
// the probe agreeing with a known answer, which measures little. A flag on a
// region nobody had read is the whole question: graded Y it is damage the
// sample missed, and graded N it is an invention, and the split between them is
// the precision any gating decision has to live with.
