// Who may re-examine an accepted issue, given who proposed it.

// WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT ESTABLISH, stated here because the number it feeds
// will be read by someone who did not run it. `RUN_MODELS` seats the SAME six
// models as critics, as adjudication panel, and as judges, and
// `mise run //package/module/translation-repair:model-catalog` confirmed on
// 2026-08-13 that the provider serves no seventh: six distinct models and four
// aliases onto four of them.
//
// So a judge can be independent of a claim's AUTHORSHIP and cannot be
// independent of its ADJUDICATION. Every candidate judge already voted on the
// issue. A crosscheck built on this measures whether a verdict survives being
// re-asked with the author removed. It does not measure precision, and calling
// it precision would be the confident wrong number this work exists to avoid.
//
// The one thing it must never do is quietly shrink. A claim nobody may judge is
// reported as such, because dropping it takes a row out of the denominator and
// lifts every rate above it while looking entirely ordinary. That exact defect
// was already found and fixed once in the attribution reader.
