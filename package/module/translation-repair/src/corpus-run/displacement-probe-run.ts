// Relocation: where the corpus carries a passage the translator MOVED across a
// section boundary, which a per-slice judge cannot tell from a fabrication,
// and what ELSE the same size reading turns up along the way.
//
// COSTS NOTHING AND DECIDES NOTHING. It reads two files per entry, counts
// characters, and prints. No model is asked, no artifact is written, and no lane
// reads its output.
//
// WHY IT REPORTS FOUR THINGS. Its first version reported one number, 44 moved
// pairs, and that number was a mixture: relocation, sections nobody translated,
// content that exists only in English, and arithmetic on slices too short to
// mean anything. Each wants a different remedy and a different ticket, so each
// is counted apart.
