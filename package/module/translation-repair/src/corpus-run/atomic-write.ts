//region Atomic write
// Writing a file that a CONCURRENT READER may list at any moment.
//
// The accumulation runs for days into a directory every rate-producing reader
// globs. A direct write is visible while it is still partial, and a partial
// artifact is worse than an unreadable one here: the census classifies it as
// malformed, the pool keeps malformed files deliberately so the reader that
// reports them still sees them, and a later reader then parses a
// now-complete file and counts it without the generation checks it should have
// faced. The window is small and the consequence is a silently wrong
// denominator, which is this package's recurring failure.
//
// Rename within one directory is atomic on every filesystem this runs on, so a
// reader sees the file either absent or whole.
//
// A WRITE THAT FAILS TAKES ITS TEMPORARY FILE WITH IT. A write the disk
// refused part way, or a rename refused by a directory standing at the path,
// used to leave `<path>.<pid>.partial` beside the target for good. Every
// reader steps over that name (`directory-listing.ts` and each reader's suffix
// filter), and none relies on finding one, so nothing was misread; the files
// only piled up. A process killed mid-write still leaves one, which nothing
// running can remove.
//
// ONE TEMPORARY NAME PER CALL, NOT PER PROCESS. Two writes of one path at
// once in one process shared `<path>.<pid>.partial`: both opened the same
// file, the later rename found it gone and rejected, and the two writes'
// bytes could interleave in it. Measured on 2026-10-05 over 100 such pairs:
// 100 rejected one write, and 8 left text at the path that was neither write
// whole. With a name per call, removing a failed write's file can never take
// a sibling write's file either.

 Removes the temporary file a failed write may have left, so the write's own

 A REMOVAL THAT FAILS TOO is said on a warning naming the file and the
 filesystem code, and the caller still sees the write's refusal: that is the
 failure the caller has to act on, and the file left over is one more
 `.partial` every reader steps over.

/**
 Writes a file so no reader can observe it half-written.

 The temporary name carries the process id and a name only this call knows,
 so no two writes of the same path, by two passes or by two calls in one
 process, share a temporary file. It sits beside the target rather than in a
 system temporary directory, because rename is only atomic within a
 filesystem and the two can differ.

 @param path - final path the content should appear at

 @param text - complete file content
