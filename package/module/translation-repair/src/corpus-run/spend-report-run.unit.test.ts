/**
 Tests for the spend report's procedure: which logs it reads, how it counts
 what they held and what it says when they cannot answer.

 A LOG WITH NO RECORDS IS NOT A RUN THAT SPENT NOTHING. A log written before
 the spend line existed carries none, so the report says it found nothing to
 total and prints no total at all: a zero total beside that sentence is the
 very figure it warns against reading.

 EVERY COUNT NOUN IS SHOWN IN THE SINGULAR AND THE PLURAL, and a count of lines
 is the lines a log holds, not the empty piece after its closing newline.

 Every log is written under a scratch directory and named by path, so nothing
 here reads a real run.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
