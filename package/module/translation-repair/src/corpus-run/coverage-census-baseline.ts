// Ledger T8: how a batch's run reads an earlier census, so the batch can prove
// it reached the stretches it claims.
//
// STRETCHES ARE MATCHED BY LINE, since a census records lines, and adding or
// removing one line renumbers the rest of the file. A source edited since the
// earlier census's commit keeps that census's stretches at lines that now
// hold other code, and matching them there read a moved stretch as run (B34's
// batch printed "ran 13" over sources it had edited). So an edited source is
// left out of the line match entirely and named with this run's own standing,
// which is all that speaks for it; the git comparison that names it is
// `sourcesEditedSince` in `coverage-census-commit.ts`.
//
// BOTH CENSUSES ARE READ, since each speaks for code the other does not: the
// baseline's stretches say what this run reached, and this run's stretches
// say what it left cold that the baseline did not (ledger B61).
