/**
 Tests for the slice census command at its boundary: the built command run in
 a child process whose environment carries no provider key, over a throwaway
 corpus repository the case builds and a scratch runs directory, so nothing
 reads the operator's corpus clone and nothing asks a model (the census asks
 none).

 The child is started by `runBuiltCommand`, which removes every variable whose
 name ends in `_API_KEY` and every one whose name starts `TRANSLATION_REPAIR_`
 before it adds the three the case names: the runs directory, the corpus clone
 and the corpus commit.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
