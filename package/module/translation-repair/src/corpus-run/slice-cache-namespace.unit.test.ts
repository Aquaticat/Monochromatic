/**
 Tests for how three lanes share one cache directory without deleting each
 other's files.

 WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The repair lane's namespace is defined by SUBTRACTION:
 it owns every file whose name is not claimed by a listed prefix. So a new
 lane that invents a prefix and forgets to register it is silently adopted by
 the repair lane, whose discard then deletes files it does not own while
 logging that it discarded its own. That error has now cost four times, most
 recently `picture.`, which was added to the store on 2026-08-19 and not to
 the list: opening the repair cache removed a picture reading and reported
 "discarding 1 cached slices".

 THE FIRST TEST WALKS THE PACKAGE'S OWN LIST, `EVERY_SLICE_NAMESPACE`, rather
 than a copy of it. It used to keep a copy, and the copy drifted exactly the
 way the registration it guards had: `contest.` and `pairing.` were missing
 from both, so a repair-lane generation change deleted an entry's contest
 ballots and its whole block pairing while reporting that it discarded its own
 slices. A guard maintained by hand fails the same way as the thing it guards,
 so it now reads the same array the store derives its claims from. The rest
 pin the containment in both directions, since a namespace that claims too
 much is as wrong as one that claims too little.

 THE `openNamespacedCache` SUITE PINS WHEN AND HOW A LANE RESTAMPS ITS
 MARKER: only when the marker does not already name the generation opening,
 and then by replacing the file, never by rewriting it in place. A marker
 cut short reads as another generation, and the open that reads it discards
 every slice the lane holds in that directory.
