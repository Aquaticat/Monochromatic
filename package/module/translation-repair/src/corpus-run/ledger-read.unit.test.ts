/**
 * Tests for reading the judged-contest ledger back.
 *
 * THE JOIN IS WHAT THESE CHECK. A ballot names a POSITION and the summary
 * speaks about MODELS, so every case here is built so a reader that lost the
 * `candidates[best - 1]` step would answer differently rather than merely
 * answer late.
 *
 * THE COMPOSITE CANDIDATE IS DELIBERATE. One candidate is written by two
 * models at once, so a ballot for it credits both, and a ballot cast BY either
 * of them is a self-vote for both. A reader crediting only the first author
 * would pass every single-author case and fail here.
 *
 * THE TWO BALLOT FAULTS ARE SEPARATED ON PURPOSE. One judge names nothing and
 * one names a fourth candidate on a three-candidate slate. Both are recorded
 * rather than corrected, and a reader folding them together would report one
 * count of two where the contest had one of each.
 *
 * THE DISINTERESTED DENOMINATOR IS CHECKED, not just the numerator. A seat
 * every judge could weigh and a seat most judges wrote are different, and only
 * the denominator tells them apart.
 *
 * Model identifiers come from the catalog. Passages are cat-themed invention,
 * so no corpus content appears here.
