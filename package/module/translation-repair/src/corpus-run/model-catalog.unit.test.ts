/**
 Boundary test for the model catalog command.

 The command asks the provider what it serves, so what is checked here is the
 one thing only the built command can show: launched with no provider key it
 refuses as stated, exits 6 and prints nothing to stdout, before any request.
 Its procedures have their own suites.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
