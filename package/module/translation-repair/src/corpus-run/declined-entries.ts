// WHAT A PASS LEAVES BEHIND FOR AN ENTRY IT DECLINED, and how the next pass
// reads it. Decided by the owner on 2026-09-08: an entry whose archive note
// says the whole page is the author's own English (`cheonwoomaeng`, the one in
// the pinned corpus) is not repaired. The pipeline's standing rule is that it
// always yields output (`doc/decision/translation-repair-always-yields-output.md`),
// and a decline keeps to its letter: the archive page stands as the output,
// untouched, and the decline is RECORDED rather than silent, which is the
// failure that rule exists to stop.
//
// BESIDE THE ARTIFACTS, NOT AMONG THEM. Every artifact reader treats a file in
// `artifacts/` as a settled two-lane artifact and refuses anything else, and
// `verify-published` expects a page for each; a decline record is neither, so
// it lives in its own directory and the scheduler's skip set is the union of
// the two.
