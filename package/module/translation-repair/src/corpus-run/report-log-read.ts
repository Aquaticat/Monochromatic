//region Report log read
// Reads the log files a report command was handed, the same way for every
// report that totals logs.
//
// A LOG THAT WILL NOT READ IS A STATED REFUSAL. A path mistyped on the command
// line is the operator's to mend, and it used to leave the command as a fault,
// with no word of which log or why, since the filesystem's own message quotes
// a path this package does not forward. The refusal names the path the
// operator typed and the filesystem's code, which carries no path.
//
// A LOG NAMED TWICE IS REFUSED where its lines would be totalled. Reading the
// same file twice counts every call, round and credit in it twice, and the
// total looks exactly like a run twice as large.
//
// THE FINAL NEWLINE IS NOT A LINE. A log a run wrote ends in a newline, and a
// split on it leaves an empty piece after the last line that a count of lines
// took for one more.
