//region Coverage bundle maps
// Ledger T8: which of the build's bundles carry a source map. The coverage
// census places cold code on source lines through the map beside each bundle,
// so a build with no map at all is the normal build, which it cannot read.
//
// A BUNDLE WITHOUT A MAP IS NOT A FAULT BY ITSELF. Rolldown writes no map for a
// chunk holding only import and export statements, since nothing in it maps
// to a source; the package's `index.mjs` became one on 2026-09-29, when the
// last small values rolldown had inlined into it left the package build
// (ledger B31), and the census, which then refused any bundle without a map,
// refused the whole build. The census now needs a map only where it places
// code, and refuses by name where one is missing there.

 Splits the bundles a build directory holds by whether a source map stands

 The census reads this before the suite runs, and it refuses only a build
 with no map at all. Before 6e631988b, which wrote this, the census refused
 any bundle without a map at the same point, before the suite. Whether such
 a bundle holds code no test ran is known only from the coverage, so that
 refusal (`requireMapFor`) now comes after the suite, and a build it refuses
 has cost one suite run. Unless rolldown leaves the map off a chunk holding
 code, such a bundle can only come from a build writing into the directory
 during the census, since the coverage build cleans the directory before it
 writes (`cleanDir` in `nodeConfig` of `@monochromatic-dev/config-rolldown`,
 which rolldown 1.2.9 documents as cleaning the output directory before
 emitting output).
