/**
 * Tests for the filter every reader applies between a directory listing and
 * the artifacts it opens.
 *
 * WHAT IT DECIDES. A reader lists the artifacts directory itself, asks the pool
 * which entries a draw may use, and then opens only the files those entries
 * own. `keepEligible` is that last step, and nothing tested it directly: four
 * readers call it, and every one of them reached the suite only through a real
 * pool over a throwaway directory, where an eligible entry and a malformed one
 * happened never to sit beside an excluded one.
 *
 * MALFORMED FILES ARE KEPT, which is the half worth pinning. The reader
 * downstream is the one that reports a corrupt artifact, so dropping it here
 * would make the file vanish from the failure list instead of appearing on it.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
