//region Settled rendering audit
// Runs the rendering audit over every decided slice of every settled version 2
// artifact in an archive, and keeps what it heard.
//
// THIS IS TELEMETRY AND NOTHING ELSE. The producing path does not change, and
// nothing this reports may gate what ships. The instrument's own production
// error rate is unmeasured: its false-negative half is open, and a measurement
// found one of the three checkers raises claims at a tenth the rate of
// the others. An instrument in that state can be believed about itself and not
// about the corpus.
//
// WHAT IT IS POINTED AT, measured rather than estimated and written up in
// `doc/audit/rendering-audit-settled-population.md`: 40 subjects across four
// artifacts, two entries settled twice. EVERY delivery row is `decided`.
//
// SIXTEEN OF THE FORTY AUDIT THE ARCHIVE'S OWN ENGLISH, because the judges
// preferred the incumbent there. The instrument was built for output with no
// BEFORE text, which is the other twenty-four. Both are worth auditing, since
// both are what the document carries, but reading them in ONE denominator would
// blur the first real measurement this produces. So every row says which it was
// and the two are reported apart.
//
// NOT A CENSUS, whatever "every artifact" suggests. Two entries cannot settle
// anything about a particular entry. The name of this probe says `settled`
// rather than `census` on purpose: a probe directory outlives the paragraph
// that qualifies it.
//
// READ `corroborated` AND `agreed` APART. The strict tier asks whether voices
// picked the same characters and the loose one asks whether they were talking
// about the same thing; four runs of `audit-sensitivity` now show the strict
// tier reporting a unanimous defect as nothing.
//
// THE RELOCATION RULE WAS FIXED BEFORE THE RUN. Per-slice judging
// cannot tell a relocation from a fabrication, so a passage the archive carried
// across a slice boundary reads as an omission on one slice and an unsupported
// addition on its neighbour. Paired omission and addition findings on ADJACENT
// slices of one entry count as ONE relocation. Written down here because
// deciding it after seeing the tally is a goalpost move.
