//region Directory listing
// Lists a directory's entries of the kind its reader takes, and names WHY a
// listing failed in the terms an operator acts on.
//
// EVERY LISTING TAKES ONE KIND (ledger B65). Each directory a run writes holds
// regular files or directories its own writer made, and nothing else: a
// symlink, a socket, a fifo or a device is never a record, and neither is a
// directory where the writer makes files. Readers that listed bare names and
// opened each took a directory named like a record as one (EISDIR out of the
// slice cache, ENOTDIR out of the published tree), read a record twice
// through a link, or read a write still in flight under its temporary name
// (`atomic-write.ts`). So a reader lists through `namesOfKind` and filters
// the names its writer gives records, and nothing else in the package calls
// `readdir` but the walkers `directory-listing-scan.unit.test.ts` names, each
// with why it must see every kind.
//
// LIFTED OUT OF TWO COPIES on 2026-08-25, following the same rule
// `error-name.ts` records: `verify-published.ts` returned an empty array and
// printed the absence, and `editor-standing-read.ts` carried its own
// `DirectoryReading` union for the identical job. A third caller was about to
// be written for the published-tree listing.
//
// NAMES THE FILESYSTEM REASON, NOT THE CLASS. Both copies reported
// `errorName`, which answers `Error` for every filesystem failure: a run
// directory that was never created and one whose permissions were changed read
// identically, while the remedies are "point at the right run" and "fix the
// mode". The `code` separates them and is a bounded token rather than a
// message, so it never quotes the path it failed on. A run directory path can
// name a person.

/**
 What listing one directory produced.

 ABSENCE IS A KIND rather than an empty list of names, because the two decide
 different things. A directory that holds nothing and a directory that is not
 there both yield nothing to work on, but only one of them says the caller
 was pointed somewhere real.

 TYPED BY THE NAMES A READER TAKES, so a listing of artifacts reads as
 artifact file names (`artifact-file-name.ts`) through the same union.

 @example
 ```ts
 const reading: DirectoryReading = { kind: 'read', names: [], };
 ```
