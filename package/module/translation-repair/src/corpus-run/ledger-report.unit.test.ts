/**
 Tests for the ledger report command at its boundary: the built command run in
 a child process over a ledger the case writes.

 The command spends no quota and asks no model, so what only the built command
 can show is what an operator meets: the whole report on stdout, the exit code
 each state leaves, and the refusal of a malformed flag as one line. The
 functions it prints with have their own files.

 THE CHILD CARRIES NO PROVIDER KEY. `runBuiltReport` removes every variable
 whose name ends in `_API_KEY` from the environment it hands the child and
 points the runs directory at a scratch directory, so nothing here reads a real
 run.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
