//region Insertion container deficit
// A CONTAINER THE ARCHIVE CARRIES SHORT OF BLOCKS. The whole-page budget
// corroborates an absent verdict by the page's size, and on a page whose
// translated part runs long it has nothing to spend: XingZ611 (2026-09-19)
// read the memorial disclosure block's third paragraph absent by a majority
// and refused it on an interior budget of zero, so it shipped as a recorded
// gap. The archive's block is a rendering of another revision of that
// memorial, three paragraphs where the original writes four, and the block's
// own shape is the deterministic second signal the budget could not give:
// inside one container the original has more blocks than the archive
// renders, so at least that many source blocks have no rendering of their
// own. An absent verdict inside such a container is admitted while the
// deficit lasts, in document order. A container the archive carries with as
// many blocks as the original admits nothing here: a merged rendering is
// what the roster's carried verdicts are for.
// THE DEFICIT DECIDES A SPLIT TOO (class sixty-nine, XingZ618, 2026-09-19):
// the rule first admitted absent verdicts alone, and the same third
// paragraph split on its next run, one voice anchoring a claim on an
// archive sentence the pairing never assigned, and stayed unresolved. A
// minority anchored claim is no majority, and a block the archive
// measurably lacks is the second signal; where a majority found the
// passage carried, the row stays out. The shape of class sixty in the tail.
//
// THE BLOCKS ARE THE PARSE'S (ledger B68), counted in
// `insertion-container-blocks.ts`, and a passage costs the blocks the
// container counted for its slice, so the deficit and what it is spent on
// are one measure.
