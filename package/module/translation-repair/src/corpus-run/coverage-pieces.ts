// Ledger T8: splits a cold stretch by the source each of its characters maps
// to, since a bundle chunk concatenates modules and one cold run can cross
// several. Every character is mapped, not only the first and last: V8's cold
// runs are merged across function and module boundaries, and nothing but the
// map says where one module ends.
//
// WHY EVERY CHARACTER (ledger M67). The census once mapped a stretch's two
// ends and recorded the whole under the first source; a subset census on
// 2026-09-29 put a stretch of 9,569 bundle characters, `repairChunk` among
// them, at one line of `src/select-candidate.ts`, and gave
// `src/repair-chunk.ts` no stretch at all. A subset run maps about 1.4 million
// cold characters, each one binary search in Node's map.
