//region Provider-aware judge seats
// WHICH JUDGES SIT, DECIDED FROM WHO WOULD SERVE THEM. The owner's decision of
// 2026-09-03 ("seat per provider reach"): a seat is withheld while the
// provider that would take its calls is one that serves it too slowly for the
// round window, or one the owner declined to pay that model's rate on, and
// seated otherwise.
//
// THE FIRST CASE. `hf:Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B` served by Hyper reasons past the 60 s
// round window in every judge role: cut in 30 of 34 translate-lane and 21 of
// 24 consolidation-slate select rounds on XIEPT2 with Hyper the only provider,
// and in 14 of 19, 11 of 19, 15 of 19 panel and 17 of 19 lane-contest rounds
// on Carena0442 (1,648 of 1,938 calls on Hyper). Served by Synthetic (Toka_ls,
// 2026-09-02) it answered 25 of 28 select rounds. The seat is lost to one
// provider's serving speed, not to the model, so dropping it outright (the
// 2026-09-03 morning's `4ad08d5dc`) threw away a judge Synthetic serves well.
//
// THE SECOND CASE. `hf:moonshotai/Kimi-K3` on OpenRouter costs 3 and 15 USD
// per million tokens, 52 to 61 percent of an entry's all-OpenRouter cost, and
// the owner decided on 2026-09-03 to withhold it wherever only OpenRouter
// would buy it (`doc/decision/translation-repair-openrouter-fallback.md`).
// That reaches its checker seat too, and a checker roster of two is below the
// hard floor `assertCheckerQuorumReachable` holds, so the next checker of the
// measured order (`RUN_CHECKER_ORDER`) a wet provider serves takes the seat.
//
// WHERE A MODEL WOULD BE SERVED is the router's own answer: the first provider
// in `PROVIDER_ORDER` that serves the model and reads wet, holds folded in
// (`providerServing`). The seat cannot follow every call, since a burst can
// overflow some of a wet Synthetic's calls to Hyper; it follows the state that
// decides most of them.
//
// READ AT EACH PHASE BOUNDARY (lanes, lane contest, consolidation), because a
// provider can run dry inside an entry: XIEPT2 read wet at 08:16 UTC on
// 2026-09-03, Synthetic ran dry at 08:19, and a once-per-entry reading left the Hyper-slow seat
// asked for three and a half hours, abandoned in 102 judge calls.
//
// AN UNREADABLE VIEW SEATS THE FULL BENCH. A budget read that fails is not
// evidence of dryness; the router will still route each call by what it
// learns at the wire, and a seat asked in vain costs one cut, while a seat
// withheld on a guess costs a voice.

 rounds when Synthetic served it (Toka_ls, 2026-09-02) and in 43 of 83 and 38
 of 101 when Hyper mostly or wholly did (XIEPT2 rerun5, 55 of its 61 cut
