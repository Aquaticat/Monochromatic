//region Coverage control
// Whether the coverage roster can vote absence AT ALL, asked before its
// unanimity is read as evidence of anything.
//
// One entry's ninety-six block-scale answers carried not one vote for
// absence. TWO DIFFERENT THINGS PRODUCE EXACTLY THAT READING: a translation
// that genuinely carries every passage, and a wire whose evidence rule admits
// any non-empty quote, so nothing can ever be found missing. Nothing recorded
// separates them, and the second would make the null an artifact of the
// instrument rather than a fact about the corpus.
//
// THE DAMAGE IS THE ROSTER'S OWN EVIDENCE. Coverage candidates are by
// construction the passages the aligners REFUSE to pair, so nothing outside the
// roster's own answer says which target text renders one. Asking first and then
// deleting exactly the spans it pointed at is the only cut known to remove the
// rendering, rather than some text that happened to sit near it.
//
// SPENDS QUOTA: two roster rounds per case.
//
// IT ASKS THE SHEET A PAGE WITH NO DECLARED NAMES GETS: its cases are cut from
// raw archives with no prepared identity, while production coverage has read
// the page's declared names since ledger B28.
