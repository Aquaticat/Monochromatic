// the sources the loaded bundles carry, and the bundles no test loaded with
// the sources only they carry. A bundle with no map is read only where code
// must be placed in it, and refused by name there (`coverage-bundle-maps.ts`).

// A stretch that is nothing but invariant throws is placed apart from the
// cold stretches, read from its own text in the bundle
// (`coverage-invariant-throw.ts`), so nothing built from the cold stretches,
// a row, a total or a baseline reading, counts a guard no honest input
// reaches as code a test should run (`coverage-census-invariant.ts`).
