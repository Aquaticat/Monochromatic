// WHICH SLICING THE SIZES DESCRIBE, said before any size is. A settled entry
// is carved through its artifact's recipe, so its slices are the ones the
// lanes judged; an entry no artifact records is carved by the deterministic
// aligner, which is a baseline the pass no longer runs, and a reader sizing a
// lane over these numbers needs to know how many rows are which.

/**
 Counts the rows whose sizes describe one carve.
