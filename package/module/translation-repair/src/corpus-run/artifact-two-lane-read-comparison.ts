//region Artifact version 2 recorded comparison
// Checking the comparison a version 2 artifact CARRIES against the one its own
// ledgers produce.
//
// The stored comparison is a claim about two ledgers stored beside it, so
// nothing has to trust it: a reader derives its own and refuses a disagreement.
// What makes that worth doing is the derivation being FROZEN. Recomputing with
// the live comparator would agree with itself under any later change to how a
// verdict is decided, while both disagreed with what the artifact meant when it
// was written; `compareLanes` is version 2's own rules over version 2's own
// rows, so a reader running it asks what this file meant rather than what the
// pipeline currently thinks.
//
// AND THE DERIVED COPY IS WHAT COMES BACK, not the recorded one. They are equal
// by the time this returns, so which one a caller gets cannot change an answer;
// returning the derived rows means a caller holds the reading this reader can
// account for.
