//region Score crosscheck run
// Reports the population a judge crosscheck would run over, WITHOUT spending a
// single call. The judging pass itself is expensive and contends with the
// corpus pass for the same per-model slots, so knowing in advance whether the
// population can carry a rate is worth more than starting one and finding out.
//
// Prints no corpus text. Claim ids are hashes and model ids are model ids, so
// this output is safe to paste anywhere the artifacts themselves are not.

 @param roster - models available to judge, which decides who may judge each claim

 @throws {@link StatedRefusalError} when the runs directory holds no readable
 `artifacts` directory, after the first line has named it
