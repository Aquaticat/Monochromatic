/**
 Tests for `coverage-control-probe` as an operator runs it: the built command
 in a child process that holds no provider key, over a throwaway corpus.

 THE COMMAND SPENDS QUOTA, so what is checked here is only what happens before
 any call: the key refusal, which the command makes before it reads its entry
 filter or the corpus, and a flag it does not read.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
