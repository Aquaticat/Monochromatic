/**
 Boundary test for the roster card command.

 The command reads a provider's live listing, so what is checked here is what
 only the built command can show: launched with no provider key it refuses as
 stated, exits 6 and prints nothing to stdout, before any request, and it
 names the key variable of the provider asked for. Its procedures have their
 own suites.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
