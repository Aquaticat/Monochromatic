/**
 Tests for the printed pair of standings of the editor calibration: the
 editor table and the refiner table, each fed from the rounds its seat was
 judged in and the models that shipped or were heard.

 CAPTURING `console.log` IS PROCESS-WIDE, which is why this file runs at
 `concurrency: 1`.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
