/**
 Tests for the run timing report's procedure: which logs it reads, what it
 prints about them and what it says when a log cannot answer.

 A LOG THAT CANNOT ANSWER IS SAID, NOT PASSED OVER. A log with no round line,
 a completion line with no duration, one with no stamp and a log with no timed
 call each name what is missing and that it is not the same as a run that
 never waited or made one call at a time, so each is a case here.

 EVERY COUNT NOUN IS SHOWN IN THE SINGULAR AND THE PLURAL, since the report
 once printed a count before a fixed plural.

 Every log is written under a scratch directory and named by path, so nothing
 here reads a real run.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
