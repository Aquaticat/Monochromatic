/**
 Tests for the driver that runs the editor calibration's slices: that it
 returns their rounds in sample order whatever order they finish in, numbers
 each progress line by position, and admits no more slices than the overlap.

 CAPTURING `console.log` IS PROCESS-WIDE, which is why this file runs at
 `concurrency: 1`.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
