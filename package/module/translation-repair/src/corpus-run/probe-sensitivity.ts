// Asks whether the introduced-defect probe can detect damage AT ALL.
//
// Run 007 reported no claims of any kind across its first eight regions: every
// prober cast an explicit negative and nothing was corroborated, contradicted,
// or even unanchored. Two readings fit that. The repairs may genuinely be
// clean, having already passed an editor ensemble, a judge selection, and a
// checker stage. Or the three defenses built into the prompt against reporting
// the pre-existing defect may have over-corrected into an instrument that never
// claims anything, in which case a whole round of zeros would be
// indistinguishable from a stage that is silently broken.
//
// Waiting for the round to end does not separate those. Injecting damage does:
// a probe that misses an obvious fabrication is not conservative, it is deaf.
//
// Probe inputs live in `probe-sensitivity-input.ts` and are cat-themed invention.
// NO corpus text, licensed or otherwise, takes part, and this writes nothing.
//
// THE ARMS LIVE IN `probe-sensitivity-arms.ts`, as data with a test,
// because this file once built its arms inline, and its `prior=shown` arm sent
// the same prompt as its `prior=absent` arm because it relied on a default
// that had flipped. Every arm now names the list it sends, and the test holds
// the name to the value before a run spends anything.
