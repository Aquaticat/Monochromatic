//region Coverage census reading
// Ledger T8: what the census does with a painted tally once the suite has
// run: places it on source lines, writes the census file, and prints the
// report, then the reading against each baseline. The two steps that touch
// the build and git are handed in, so a case scripts them.

/**
 Maps the tally to source lines, writes the census file and prints the
 report, then the baseline reading when one was asked for.

 @param asked - command line as read

 @param packageDirectory - package directory

 @param distDirectory - build directory

 @param bundleMaps - bundles the build holds, split by whether a map stands
 beside each

 @param head - commit built from

 @param clean - whether the files matched it

 @param passes - passing markers the suite printed

 @param tally - painted tally

 @param reportDirectory - where the census file goes

 @param baselines - earlier census files named, already read

 @param place - places the tally on source lines through the build's maps,
 passed in because it reads the build

 @param editedSince - asks git which files changed since a commit, passed in
 because it runs git

 @throws StatedRefusalError where the coverage names a bundle the build
 does not hold, finds code no test ran in a bundle with no map, or finds
 a bundle no test loaded that has no map to say which sources it carries,
 or where the census places an uncalled function outside its own source's
 stretches

 @example
 ```ts
 await reportCensus({ asked, packageDirectory, distDirectory, bundleMaps, head, clean, passes, tally, reportDirectory, baselines, place: placeTally, editedSince: sourcesEditedSince, },);
