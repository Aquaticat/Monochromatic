/**
 Guards ledger X14: the pass seams wire each phase's re-seat hook into its
 driver. The hooks and the drivers each have their own cases, but no case drove
 a seam, so a seam that dropped its hook survived every guard. Each case here
 runs a seam against a client whose dryness view changes after the phase's own
 reading, under a hold: only a wired hook seats the bench the second view
 seats. A control whose view never changes shows the seat the change removes
 would otherwise have been asked.

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
