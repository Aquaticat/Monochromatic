/**
 * Tests for the catalog report an operator reads before changing the roster.
 *
 * WHAT THESE PIN is which list each section is rendered from. The report has
 * three sections built from three arrays whose members are the same shape, so
 * rendering the aliases where the unlisted models belong produces a report that
 * reads perfectly and tells an operator to seat an alias. Its own comparison
 * says what that costs: one model would vote twice on a panel, and a single
 * opinion would read as two independent confirmations.
 *
 * SEPARATE FROM `model-catalog-compare.unit.test.ts` on purpose. `await
 * describe` throws, so a failing suite aborts its whole file, and a `GFP` round
 * over this report must not depend on the suites above it having passed.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention in the shape of provider ids. No corpus
 * content appears here.
