// What the walk has bought and refused so far, and the point at which a run of
// refusals ends it. Moved out of `window-trial-probe.ts`: each step takes the
// tally before a slice and returns the tally after it, so the walk holds no
// counter it mutates.
//
// A REFUSAL IS COUNTED AND WALKED PAST, never fatal to the run. A slice can
// refuse for reasons that are properties of the slice rather than of the
// trial: no neighbouring section to widen to, or a slice with no incumbent
// whose judges all declined. Aborting the walk on one of those would stop the
// run at the same slice on every resumption, and since the refusal is never
// recorded, no amount of restarting would ever get past it.

/**
 Refusals in a row that end the run.

 Small, because slices that genuinely cannot be tried do not cluster: the draw
 interleaves entries and classes, so several in a row is a provider or a
 roster, not a run of awkward slices.

 A REFUSAL IS NOT FREE: the slate is produced before any arm is judged, so a

 slice and leaves an empty ledger. Slices that genuinely cannot be tried are
 scattered through the draw, so a run of them says the fault is the run's
 rather than the slices'.
