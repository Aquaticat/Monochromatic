// THE PREPARATION'S ATTESTATION ROUND, split out of `preparePassEntry` so a

 Archive details a reference states, attested by the roster the hook hands
 over (class thirty-seven, 2026-09-16; ledger X12, 2026-09-28): the repair
 lane screens addition claims against them before the panel, and every sheet
 reads them as ATTESTED lines under the references.

 THE HOOK IS READ ONLY WHEN THE ROUND IS ASKED, since an original linking
 nowhere asks nobody and so has no bench to re-seat.

 @param client - injected model client

 @param modelIds - roster the preparation started on

 @param beforeItem - hook handing the round its roster, `keepBench` for a
 caller with none; required so no caller drops it by omission

 @param sourceText - the original

 @param archiveText - archive as the preparation reads it

 @param referenceLines - what the pages the original links say, empty when it
 links nowhere

 @param signal - entry deadline and caller abort

 @param exchangeTimeoutMs - per-call bound

 @param l - entry logger

 @returns Attested details, their sheet lines and the round's findings

 @example
 ```ts
 const attestation = await attestPassReferences({ client, modelIds, beforeItem, sourceText, archiveText, referenceLines, signal, exchangeTimeoutMs, l, },);
