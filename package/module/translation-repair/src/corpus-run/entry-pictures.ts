//region Entry pictures
// GATHERING ONE ENTRY'S PICTURES OFF THE PINNED CORPUS, which is the only step
// of reading a picture that knows where a corpus lives.
//
// THE LANE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT DISKS and must not. `readDocumentPictures` takes
// bytes and returns readings; this turns an entry id and a slicing into those
// bytes. Splitting them is what keeps the lane a function of its arguments and
// testable without a corpus checkout.
//
// AT THE PIN, not from a working tree, exactly as the page text is read. A
// picture read from a different commit than its page would be a different
// picture, and the mismatch would show up as a reading nobody could explain.
//
// AN UNREADABLE PICTURE IS SKIPPED RATHER THAN FATAL. Measured over the pinned
// corpus, 380 references resolve to 380 files present and none missing, so this
// path is not expected to run; if it ever does, one absent asset must not cost
// an entry that has 50 other slices to settle. The gap becomes a finding on the
// slices that show it, because `slicePictures` reports a picture with no reading
// as unread.
