//region Archive front matter authority
// WHOSE FRONT MATTER THE PAGE CARRIES, decided by the owner on 2026-09-08
// after the ninth hakureico pass renamed the person in slice zero (`name:
// Kagurazaka Chika`, six ballots to three, endorsed nine of nine) while the
// body kept the archive's `Hanasaka`, and a census of the shipped pages found
// nine of the last ten read pages rewriting `desc` or `alias` ("We're not
// supposed to change front matter though?"). The rule: the archive's front
// matter is published as it stands, and the lanes render it only where the
// archive never translated it, which is the #269 shape the publication guard
// already names: the visible name is the directory id while the source names
// the person, and neither the pinyin reading nor an alias makes the id stand.
//
// DECIDED BEFORE PREPARATION AND CHECKED AGAIN AT PUBLICATION. The
// preparation omits slice zero when the archive stands, so no lane spends on
// it and no judge is asked to prefer a rendering over the archive's editorial
// choice; the publication guard recomputes the same answer from the two
// documents and refuses a page whose front matter differs from the archive's
// where it stands, so a preparation that forgot the rule cannot ship.
