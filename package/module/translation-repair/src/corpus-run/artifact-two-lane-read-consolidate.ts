//region Artifact version 2 consolidation read
// Reading what the third rendering settled over one document.
//
// ITS OWN FILE for the reason the pairing read is: the whole-artifact reader
// has no room under the file-length limit, and this is a subject of its own,
// with an absence carrying two meanings and a payload that decides what a
// reader ships. Its leaf shapes sit in `artifact-two-lane-read-consolidate-parts.ts`.
//
// EVERY REFUSAL HERE MIRRORS AN INVARIANT THE PRODUCER ALREADY HOLDS, which is
// the only kind worth enforcing on a stored record: `describeConsolidateSlice`
// writes one record per contested slice, in comparison-row order, and carries
// text on exactly the consolidated terminal. The first two are checked against
// the contest the same artifact records, the way the contest itself is checked
// against the comparison; the third is checked per slice.

/**
 * What an artifact says about the third rendering over its document.
 *
 * THREE STATES, NOT TWO. `not-run` is a pass that chose not to ask; `unrecorded`
 * is an artifact written before the field existed, which is every artifact
 * settled before this landed. Collapsing them would let a census of how often
 * the stage declines count the whole earlier archive as declines.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const consolidation: ParsedConsolidation = { kind: 'unrecorded', };
 * ```

 * answered, so a record missing from that set, or naming a slice outside it,
 * or out of its order, was not written by this pipeline, and a consumer keying
 * by `sliceIndex` would otherwise read a missing slice as left with what the
 * contest settled. Measured before this was written: all 28 artifacts on this
 * machine carrying the field, across schema versions 2, 3 and 4, name exactly
 * their contest's slices in its order, one of them naming none at all.
 *
 * @param slices - records the stage carries

 * @param laneSelection - contest the same artifact records, already proven to
 * cover the eligible slices; a pending selection settled nothing
