/**
 Tests for `coverage-probe` as an operator runs it: the built command in a
 child process that holds no provider key, over a throwaway corpus and a
 throwaway runs directory.

 THE COMMAND SPENDS QUOTA, so what is checked here is only what happens before
 any call: the key refusal, which the command makes after it has read its own
 command line and before it reads the corpus, and the flags it does not accept.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
