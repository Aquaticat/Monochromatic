// EVERY MEMBER'S KEYS ARE LISTED, per member rather than per union, because
// that is the check the shape needs: `{ kind: 'not-evaluated', acceptedText }`
// is not a slice this version can describe, and a parser reading the
// discriminator and then taking whatever fields it recognizes would accept it
// and hand a reader an outcome carrying a wording nobody decided.
//
// AN UNKNOWN DISCRIMINATOR IS ALWAYS REFUSED, in both `unknownKeys` modes. It names a
// member this version cannot project into any of its own, so there is no
// tolerant reading of it: taking the row anyway would mean recording a slice
// under a name this reader made up.
