//region Destination renderings
// WHICH SOURCE DESTINATIONS A PAGE MAY LACK, given how the archive rendered them.
//
// THE OWNER'S DECISION OF 2026-09-04 ("Either rendering"): where the archive
// rendered a reference another way than the original (`twitter.com` moved to
// `x.com`, a Chinese Wikipedia article replaced by the English one), a text
// owes one rendering, taken from either side, never both and never neither.
// `translate-atom-rendering.ts` applies that per slice; this is the same rule
// over the whole would-ship page, so the publisher does not refuse the page
// the slice rule accepted. The luxuanwen3 re-run of 2026-09-04 (13:18 UTC)
// ended exactly there: every slice passed, and `DroppedDestinationError` read
// the source alone and refused the `x.com` page 56 minutes in.
//
// THE POOL IS THE WHOLE DOCUMENT'S. Source destinations the archive never
// carried and archive destinations the source never carried form one pool; the
// page owes the larger side's count from it. A destination both sides carry
// as written is owed outright, as before. With no archive, or one carrying
// nothing the source does not, this is the old rule: every source destination
// owed. The document pool is coarser than the slice pools, never stricter: a
// page assembled from slices each meeting its own pool meets this one.
//
// WHAT STAYS A SOURCE GUARD. An archive destination the page lost is not a
// source destination and is not reported here; the slice rule refuses that
// text before it ships.
