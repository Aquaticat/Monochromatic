// A CREDENTIAL THE REQUEST CARRIED NEVER LEAVES THIS READ IN A BODY. A provider
// may echo the key it was sent, an authentication failure's body being the
// plausible place, and both listing commands print what they read. The mask is
// applied here, to the text, before it is parsed, so no caller can parse,
// print, store or throw an unmasked body: the transport the caller hands in
// may be the live one, which masks too, or any other.

 How long one listing may take before it is abandoned, in milliseconds.

 A CHOICE, NOT A MEASUREMENT. The reads this replaced waited as long as the
 provider cared to, and the transport's own idle guard ends a stalled stream;
 this bounds a provider that answers slowly all the same, at the freshness
 window the budget meters use.

 @param apiKey - key sent as a bearer token, never printed

 @param transport - transport the request goes over: `fetchTransport` in a run

 @param timeoutMs - how long the request may run before it is abandoned

 @param statusRefusal - sentence the command refuses with when the provider
 answers with a status outside 200 to 299, built from the status alone since
 the reason phrase and the body are the provider's wording

 @returns The listing as parsed JSON, read from a body with every credential
 the request carried masked out of it

 @throws {@link StatedRefusalError} When the provider answers with a status
 outside 200 to 299, or with a body that is not JSON (neither refusal repeats
 the body)
