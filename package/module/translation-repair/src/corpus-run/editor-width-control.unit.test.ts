//region Editor width control cut
// What the positive control actually asks the panel about.
//
// The gate in front of the width draw damages a passage and checks the panel
// prefers the intact one. Everything downstream rests on the damage being real:
// a cut that returned the passage unchanged would let the gate pass on a blind
// panel, and a cut that returned blank on everything would fail a working one.
//
// Fixtures are invented cat prose, never corpus text.
