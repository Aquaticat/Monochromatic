// ONE pass at a time per runs directory.
//
// Nothing stopped two from sharing one. They would interleave on every durable
// thing the run owns, and each failure is silent in its own way:
//
//   `attempts.json` is read at startup and rewritten before each entry, so the
//   second pass writes counts derived from a map it read before the first pass
//   started. Attempts stop counting attempts, and attempts order the queue.
//
//   A slice cache is opened per entry, and opening one under a different
//   pipeline DELETES it. Two passes under different builds would take turns
//   destroying each other's finished slices, each recomputing what the other
//   just threw away, for as long as both ran.
//
//   Artifacts are written atomically, so neither is torn, but the later write
//   wins and the earlier entry's work is simply gone.
//
// The atomic rename in `writeFileAtomic` protects a READER from a half-written
// file. It says nothing about two writers, which is this. Who holds a lock and
// whether it still runs is `runs-lock-holder.ts`.
//
// THE LOCK APPEARS WITH ITS HOLDER ALREADY IN IT. It used to be created empty
// and written after, and a starter that finds a lock it cannot read takes it
// over, since a pass killed between the two leaves exactly that. So a second
// starter arriving between the create and the write read a live holder's
// empty lock as unreadable, moved it aside and claimed its own, and both
// passes went on: measured on 2026-10-05, two starters at once on a fresh
// directory in one process both held it in 28 of 200 rounds. The holder's
// text is now written to a name only this claim knows and hard-linked to the
// lock's name, which fails when anything stands there, so the claim and the
// text are one filesystem operation. A runs directory on a filesystem without
// hard links refuses the lock with that filesystem's own error.
