/**
 * Tests for one slice run at both editor widths.
 *
 * THREE ARMS RUN, NOT TWO, and that is the property the whole width probe rests
 * on. The third arm repeats the NARROW roster so the comparison has a null band
 * of its own: without it, the headline number, how often widening changed the
 * shipped text, cannot be told apart from the lane simply disagreeing with
 * itself run to run. A version that ran two arms and reported
 * `narrowRepeatAgreed: true` would not fail loudly. It would produce a confident
 * number from a comparison with no band under it, and every reading of `#186`
 * would tilt toward width mattering.
 *
 * SO THE COUNT IS THE ASSERTION. Both fixtures below count editor calls per
 * seat, and the seats are asymmetric on purpose: two narrow against three wide,
 * so three arms cost seven calls where two would cost five. A count is the only
 * evidence that separates them, because both shapes return a well-formed row.
 *
 * THE STUB CLIENT COSTS NO QUOTA. `runWidthSlice` takes its client, so every
 * call here is answered in-process, and the replies are validated against the
 * live request's own wire guard rather than assumed to fit it.
 *
 * A PANEL THAT ALWAYS PICKS THE FIRST SEAT IS REPORTED AS `position-decided`,
 * never as a win. That is the anti-laundering guard: the head-to-head runs both
 * seating orders precisely so a preference for the seat cannot be published as a
 * preference for the text, and the churning fixture drives exactly that case.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention, and the model identifiers are real catalog
 * seats because a roster is checked against the catalog.
