/**
 * Tests for the markup-only slice reading.

 * `#107` named this class by hand: a slice that is entirely a photo component
 * sits near ratio 1.00 whatever the translator did, so it is below baseline for
 * a reason unrelated to giving a passage up and pairs with any high neighbour.
 *
 * The cases that matter are the two NULLS. A screen that called ordinary prose
 * markup would suppress real relocation candidates, which is a worse failure
 * than the one it was built to fix, because a suppressed candidate leaves no
 * trace to audit.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
