//region Archive-original publication completeness
// THE PAGE CARRIES EVERY SEALED SPAN AS THE ARCHIVE HAS IT, checked at
// publication rather than trusted from the preparation, for the same reason
// the front-matter guard recomputes its answer: a preparation that sealed a
// span and a lane that wrote over it anyway would otherwise ship the rewrite
// under a record saying it was sealed. Decided by the owner on 2026-09-08
// after the twelfth hakureico pass rewrote Hanasaka's letter in five places
// under a note saying the English was the original.
//
// BYTE FOR BYTE, since the seal's whole meaning is that no lane, no typography
// pass and no wrap touched the span. A page that carries the span's bytes at
// least once passes; it need not carry them at the recorded offsets, since
// the slices before the span may have grown or shrunk.

 CARRIES WHAT IT NAMES (ledger F-12): the entry, the span's index and the
 span's archive offsets are fields, so a caller can find the span without
 parsing the message, as the sibling completeness errors allow.
