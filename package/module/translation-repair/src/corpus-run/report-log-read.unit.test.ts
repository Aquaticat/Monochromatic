/**
 Tests for reading the log files a report command was handed.

 A LOG THAT WILL NOT READ IS REFUSED IN WORDS. A path mistyped on the command
 line is the operator's to mend, so the refusal names the path they typed and
 the filesystem's code and says what to name instead; it quotes nothing the
 filesystem said, since a failure's own message repeats a path.

 A LOG NAMED TWICE IS REFUSED, including where two spellings reach one file,
 since totalling a log twice reads as a run twice as large.

 THE CLOSING NEWLINE IS NOT A LINE, and a blank line inside a log is one.

 Every file is written under a scratch directory. Fixtures are cat-themed
 invention. No corpus content appears here.
