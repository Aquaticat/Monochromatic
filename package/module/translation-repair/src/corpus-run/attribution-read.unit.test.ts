/**
 Tests for the parser that reads attribution out of settled artifacts.

 These exist because the report's own tests hand `sliceCritics` in by hand, so
 they exercise the FOLD and never the WIRING. The eligible-versus-ineligible
 decision the whole report rests on is not made there at all: it is made in
 `attributionEntryOf`, by OMITTING the key for an artifact that carries no
 attribution.

 The distinction these guard is ABSENT versus MALFORMED. Only an absent key
 means the entry predates attribution. A key that is present but corrupt must
 fail loudly, because letting it fall through to the same omission would move
 a broken artifact into the pre-feature population on the strength of its own
 breakage, and the population is what every number divides by.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention.
