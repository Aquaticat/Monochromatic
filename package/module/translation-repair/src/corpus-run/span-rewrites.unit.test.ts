/**
 Tests the one span-rewrite applier the page passes share (audit area six):
 rewrites applied in offset order whatever order they arrive in, and one that
 overlaps a rewrite kept before it withheld rather than spliced behind the
 cursor, which repeated text on the page.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention.
