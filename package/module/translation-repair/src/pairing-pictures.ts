// WHAT THE PAIRING SHEET IS SHOWN ABOUT A SECTION'S PICTURES (class
// thirty-four, 2026-09-16).
//
// ONE TRANSCRIPT PER PICTURE, the one the other readers carry most, the same
// choice the archive block review made on 2026-09-16: the pairing judge needs
// to recognise that an English block renders a picture, not to weigh six
// readings of it, and a sheet already carrying two whole sections is not the
// place to add five more.
//
// RENDERED BY `slicePictures` over the section as a one-slice window, so the
// PICTURE headings and the side legend read exactly as every other sheet has
// them.

 @param pictureReadings - what reading produced per asset name for this entry
