/**
 Guards class one hundred forty-eight (hulicaijia29, 2026-09-26): Bedrock
 served one Gemma model at 219 to 263 s a stream for fifty minutes while its
 other models kept their pace, and every round waited on that seat up to the
 360 s deadline. A call cut at its card's measured stream bound now holds
 that provider out for that model: the call is asked again of the next
 provider serving the model, a model no other provider serves reads
 unreachable without a call, and the provider's other models are served.
 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
