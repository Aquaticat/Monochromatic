//region Rendering audit invariant
// A state the rendering audit's own construction rules out, met anyway.
//
// ONE CLASS FOR EVERY SITE. Six places in the audit throw on a state their
// callers cannot produce: a canonicalization that changed a length, a category
// outside every anchoring rule, a group with no members, a delivered slice no
// comparison row names. Each was a bare `Error`, which the package's rule on
// refusals (PP4) asks to be a named class, so a reader of a stack or a log can
// tell an invariant from an operator refusal or a provider fault by name alone.
//
// UNMARKED ON PURPOSE. The class forwards each site's own sentence, and the
// inventory in `message-names-only.unit.test.ts` reserves the marker for
// classes that write theirs. The sentences name slice indexes, vocabulary words
// and the shape of a group, never text, so nothing is lost when
// `reportingRefusals` prints `refused by RenderingAuditInvariantError` and the
// frames, which is the right report for a fault in the command.
