/**
 Tests the wait a refused reply's own body names, read by one forward scan
 (`retry-stated-wait.ts`). The ladder that sleeps it is exercised in
 `transient-retry.unit.test.ts`; these cases pin what the scan reads out of a
 body, where a number runs to the end of it and where the parts of one wait
 are joined by the word "and". Fixtures are cat-themed invention.
