 Decides what a claim's anchors prove about one region.

 The differential runs in BOTH directions, because collateral damage comes in
 two shapes and only one of them can be quoted from the new text. Wording the
 edit ADDED is checkable as present in AFTER and absent from BEFORE. Wording
 the edit DROPPED cannot be quoted from AFTER at all, since its absence is the
 defect, and is checkable as present in BEFORE and absent from AFTER. Judging
 only the first direction would have made every omission claim unanchored,
 which is the failure mode worth guarding hardest against: dropping a clause
 while rewriting is among the likeliest ways an editor causes damage.

 A claim carrying BOTH anchors is a wire fault rather than a stronger claim.
 Screening each and taking the better answer would let a prober launder a
 contradicted anchor by attaching a second one.

 A side is an anchor when it shows a reader something, which is asked of
 `rendersAsNothing` and never of an empty-string comparison: a side holding
 only spaces, a zero-width space or a filler quotes nothing, and counting it
 made a one-sided claim read as anchored both ways (ledger B128).

/**
 Decides whether a claim is pointing at a defect that was already reported.

 This is the defence the PROMPT used to provide by listing the accepted issues
 and forbidding a prober from re-reporting them. Listing them measurably
 silenced the stage: with the list shown the probe raised 2 admissible claims
 across 45 verdicts on regions a reader called damaged, and with it withheld,
 18. Moving the same defence here keeps it while letting the prober look at
 the text without being told what to excuse, which is the split
 `screenNonTranslationVotes` already set as precedent: deterministic evidence
 dismisses a claim rather than a prompt preventing it.

 Containment is checked BOTH ways for ADDED wording, because those two quotes
 are cut by different parties. A critic quotes the phrase it objected to, and a
 prober quotes as much of the surrounding wording as it thinks damaged, so
 neither is reliably the longer one.

 REMOVAL CLAIMS TAKE ONLY ONE DIRECTION, and the difference is the whole point.
 A removal claim quotes the wording that DISAPPEARED, drawn from the before
 text, which is the same side the critic quoted, on a region that exists
 precisely because the critic quoted something in it. So containment is close
 to guaranteed, and which way it runs is the entire signal:

 - Dropped wording INSIDE the prior quote was licensed to disappear. Removing
   the objected-to phrase is what the repair was for, so a prober reporting its
   absence is restating the accepted issue. Discounted.
 - Dropped wording CONTAINING the prior quote means the edit took the
   objected-to phrase AND unrelated content with it. That is the over-deletion
   shape a human grader found as a deleted contributor credit, and it is a NEW
   defect the critic never asked for. It must survive.

 Checking both ways here suppressed exactly the second case. Measured:
 removal-corroborated ran 159 across the original 56-entry run and 0 across
 every run after this reclassification landed, while corroborated held its rate
 per region, because added-wording claims quote the AFTER text and never
 collided.

 Both quotes arrive as the differential read them, through `asScreened`
 (ledgers B24 and B128), and the claim's quote is the side the differential
 corroborated. A quote chosen here by any other rule can disagree with the
 verdict it is checked under: a claim corroborated on its evidence, with an
 omitted side of spaces, was once checked on those spaces and so restated
 nothing.

 @param quoted - side the differential corroborated the claim on, as
 `asScreened` returns it
