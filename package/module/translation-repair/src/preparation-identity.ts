// WHICH SLICING a result describes, as against which entry it names.

// Two lanes are compared slice by slice, joined on a global index. Equal slice
// counts, equal indices and equal incumbent text do not prove the two ran over
// one preparation: the same wording can cover different source passages, and
// every insertion anchor's incumbent is the empty string, so a document with
// several untranslated sections offers several rows that look identical. A
// comparison joining two slicings is undetectable afterwards, because every row
// it produces is individually well formed.
//
// So a preparation names itself, once, and everything derived from it records
// that name.
//
// WHAT IT COVERS is the preparation and nothing else: both documents, every
// slice's placement, offsets and exact text, the pairing between the two sides,
// the line-structured flag, and the identity context. What it deliberately
// EXCLUDES is everything about the run: the commit, the pipeline digest, the
// rosters, the call configuration, timings, cache state, and any lane's output.
// A resumed run over the same slicing must produce the same identity, or the
// field answers "was this the same attempt" rather than the question it is for.
//
// The target's PLACEMENT KIND is the field that earns this. Without it a
// content slice that happens to be blank and a place the archive never
// translated hash identically, which is the pair every other guard here exists
// to separate.
