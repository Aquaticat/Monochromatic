/**
 Guards class eighty (shi_Yumiaoya, 2026-09-22): the ORIGINAL quotes a film
 line in Chinese with the film's own English directly beside it, and its
 attribution the same way. The line floor counts such a pair as one line owed
 (class forty-seven) and the archive carries the English alone, but every
 line-structure wording on the sheets said "never drop a line" and the judges'
 criterion called a dropped line FAULTY, so the writers rendered the Chinese
 line a second time in English beside the film's own words (shi_Yumiaoya10)
 or kept it in Chinese on an English page (shi_Yumiaoya4 to 9), and the
 judges split between "omits the first quoted line" and "keeps the original
 English line after adding a new translation". The three wordings now say
 that such a pair is one line whose English is already its rendering.

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
