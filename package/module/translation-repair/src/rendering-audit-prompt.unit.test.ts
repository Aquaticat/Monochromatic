/**
 Tests for what one auditor is actually asked.

 WHY THESE ARE WORTH PINNING: the taxonomy in this prompt is what decides
 whether two voices describing one defect describe it the same way, and a
 vocabulary that grows without its definition growing too would fragment the
 labels silently. The drift cases in this file fail the moment a category is added to
 the wire and not defined here.

 THE FENCE CASE IS ADVERSARIAL: both texts are pasted into a fenced block, and
 a passage carrying its own fence run would otherwise close the block early
 and turn its own tail into instructions.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
