/**
 Guards the owner's answers of 2026-09-27 to the whole-package audit on two
 house rules every sheet reads.

 MEDICATION: the rule called "took medication" a method kept vague while
 class one hundred twenty-two let the page say that she had taken
 medication. The owner answered that "took medication" is fine because it
 is not replicable, and replicability is the test
 (`doc/decision/translation-repair-reader-protection-cause-of-death.md`).

 TITLES: the rule set a title in quotation marks while most archives set a
 work's title in italics and a page pass restores them. The owner chose
 italics for works (`doc/decision/translation-repair-title-style.md`).

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
