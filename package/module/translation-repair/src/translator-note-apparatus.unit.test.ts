/**
 Guards class one hundred forty-three (hulicaijia26, 2026-09-26). The
 archive's footnote 7 carried the translator's note explaining the wordplay
 between 晚安 (goodnight) and 金刚烷胺 (amantadine), which the English cannot
 carry by itself. deepseek-v4.1-flash filed it as accuracy/addition, the panel
 accepted it (minimax-m3 and gemma-4-26b-a4b-it for, Mercury 2.5 against), the
 acceptance disputed the archive under class one hundred seven, and four of
 five contest judges called the note "an addition the ORIGINAL never states".
 The critic and the panel sheets named citations, credits and identifying
 glosses as accurate translator detail, but no sheet named a note explaining
 wordplay, and the page-apparatus clause the writers and the contest read was
 on neither sheet that files and accepts the claim.

 The same clause said "only what the ORIGINAL contradicts is an addition",
 which is the wording a class one hundred eight gate ballot used to keep an
 invented overdose detail ("which the Chinese does not contradict"). The
 apparatus is what explains the text; what happened is never apparatus.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention.
