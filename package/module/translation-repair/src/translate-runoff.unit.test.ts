/**
 Guards class fifty-three (XingZ602 attempt 1, 2026-09-18): a slate judged
 at a slice with nothing to fall back on, whose judges split three ways at
 weight one, is challenged as a RUN-OFF over the candidates that drew a
 ballot rather than over the whole slate again. Slice 14 of XingZ60 carried
 an archive text the deterministic floor refused ("TA once said"), so the
 stage ran it as absent; five candidates, three ballots, three different
 picks, twice (here: three candidates, two named once each, one decline); the entry stopped ERROR after two hours and thirty-eight
 minutes and re-bought its translate lane. Cat-themed invention throughout;
 no corpus content appears here.
