// is back AND grounded in the Chinese. Wording may differ freely, so a
// terse but faithful re-translation counts as restored; a vocabulary-overlap
// grader under-credited exactly those, which is why this replaces it as the

- restored: the reference's information is fully present in the repaired translation AND supported by the ORIGINAL Chinese
- partial: some but not all of the reference's information is present and grounded
- absent: the information is missing from the repaired translation

Judge MEANING, not wording. Different phrasing, word order, or a terse-but-faithful rendering all count as restored. Do not require the exact words of the reference.
Information not supported by the ORIGINAL Chinese is never restored, even if it reads well.

Reply with ONLY a JSON object of shape {"judgments": [{"reference": 1, "verdict": "restored"}]}. No prose, no code fences.
Every reference number must appear exactly once.`;
