// TRANSLATES A ROSTER'S SECTION PAIRING INTO THE VOCABULARY `alignDocumentSections`
// ALREADY READS, so nothing downstream of alignment learns that a model was
// involved. `pair-blocks-steps.ts` does the same job one scale down.
//
// THE PAIRING IS WHAT PROVES AN INSERTION BOUNDARY. `#100` landing 5 can place
// an untranslated section only where every optimal alignment agrees it belongs,
// and measured over the pinned corpus the deterministic aligner never agrees
// with itself about anything: all 11 unpaired source sections come back
// `ambiguous`, so `may-pair` refuses every one and the insertion path emits
// nothing. Two paired sections either side of an unpaired one pin it to the
// span between them, and when that span is one boundary wide the anchor is
// PROVEN in exactly the sense the deterministic path meant by it.
//
// AFFINITY IS REPORTED, NOT INVENTED. A `paired` step carries the affinity of
// its pairing, and a roster pairing has whatever affinity the two headings
// actually share, which on these entries is 0.00. Recording the measurement is
// the point: it is why a model was asked.
