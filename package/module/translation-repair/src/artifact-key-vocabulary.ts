//region Artifact key vocabulary
// Which spelling of three keys a settled artifact uses, chosen by the
// generation the file records rather than guessed from what it contains.
//
// Generations 1 and 2 spelled these keys with `chunk`, in the same records that
// already spelled `sliceCount` and `withdrawnSliceCount` with `slice`, about
// the same things. Generation 4 spells all of them `slice`. Nothing else about
// the shape moved across any of it, which is why one table of four names covers
// the whole difference and there is no second reader family.
//
// GENERATION 3 IS A MIXTURE and needs its own row rather than a style name: it
// spells the three arrays the way generation 4 does and the per-slice index the
// way generation 2 did. The two moved separately because `sliceIndex` was
// already taken by a different concept, the POSITION in `prepared.slices`, and
// had to be freed before the stamped index could take the name.
//
// NO ARTIFACT IS EVER READ UNDER TWO SPELLINGS. The recorded version selects one
// table, and a file whose keys disagree with the table its own version selected
// fails to parse. That is the right answer rather than a harshness to soften: a
// version 3 file carrying `shippedChunkIndices` is not a version 3 file.
//
// THE TABLE IS TOTAL OVER GENERATIONS THIS PACKAGE KNOWS, and refuses anything
// else by name. `KNOWN_ARTIFACT_SCHEMA_VERSIONS` and this table can drift apart
// in exactly one direction, a version added there and forgotten here, and the
// refusal is what turns that into a stopped read instead of a key silently read
// under the wrong generation's spelling.

/**
 * Keys whose spelling moved between generations, under the names the rest of

 *
 * SPELLED OUT AS THREE FIELDS rather than carried as a map from new name to old
 * name, so a reader that names a key this table does not cover fails to compile
 * instead of reading `undefined` off a lookup and asking the artifact for a key
 * called `undefined`.
 *
 * THE FIELDS ARE PLAIN STRINGS rather than the literals themselves, because
 * every use here is a lookup or a path fragment. A WRITER cannot take its keys
 * from this table for that reason: `isolatedDeclarations` requires the
 * annotation, the annotation widens the literals, and a computed key of type
 * `string` builds an object with an index signature instead of named fields.
 * `artifact-build.ts` writes its keys out and names this table in a comment.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const keys: ArtifactKeyVocabulary = SLICE_SPELLED_KEYS;
 * ```
