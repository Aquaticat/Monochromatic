//region Channel marker tails
// A provider emits special tokens of the shape `<|word|>` and filters them out
// of streamed content. The filter is not atomic across event boundaries, so
// when a token straddles two deltas a TAIL of it survives and lands in front of
// otherwise correct JSON.
//
// Observed on `hf:moonshotai/Kimi-K3`: `|>` on 2026-08-12, then `p|>` and
// `ep|>` on 2026-08-13, all three being suffixes of the same `<|...|>` shape.
// The first fix matched the exact string `|>`, which is what survived on the
// first day, and therefore stopped working the moment the surviving tail grew
// by one character, which is how 21 of the 23 voices lost in the most recent
// run window were lost.
//
// SO THE RULE IS THE SHAPE, NOT A VOCABULARY. Matching a list of known tokens
// would require knowing the provider's special-token set, which we do not and
// cannot read from here; every tail of every marker is covered by checking that
// what sits in front of the JSON could only be the end of a `<|word|>`. The
// cost of the shape rule is that it also strips a fragment no real token ever
// produced, such as `xep|>`; that costs nothing, because the alternative to
// stripping it is failing to parse.
//
// The property the previous implementation protected is kept: this refuses to
// be a general "skip junk until the first opening brace" rule, which would
// swallow a model prefixing an apology or partial refusal and turn content the
// refusal detector must classify into a silent parse success. An apology
// carries spaces and does not close with `|>` inside a dozen characters, so it
// still fails to parse, loudly.
//
// DELIBERATELY OUT OF SCOPE: a leak of `>` alone, with the `|` also consumed.
// Every observed tail closes with `|>`, and accepting a bare `>` would also
// strip a Markdown blockquote marker ahead of JSON. Should it ever happen it
// arrives diagnosable rather than silent, because the caller logs the opening
// characters of anything that fails to parse.
