// THE DAMAGE EVERY OTHER INSTRUMENT HERE MISSES.
//
// On `saurikissa` slice 4 the repair lane replaced a hundred and thirty-six
// words with twenty-one, deleting what she wore and what she collected from a
// memorial page. The assembled document lost seventy characters of four
// thousand four hundred and seventy-nine, because generic prose went in where
// the detail had been.
//
// So the length looked right, the structure was intact, nothing repeated,
// nothing was severed, no footnote broke, and the page had stopped being about
// a particular person. Length, repetition, severing and footnote checks all
// read clean on it. `doc/audit/the-damage-no-instrument-was-catching.md` carries
// the measurement.
//
// REPAIR LANE ONLY, and that is a correctness requirement rather than a
// shortcut. The translate lane writes a fresh rendering from the source, so it
// may carry the same detail in different English words, and a rare-word test
// cannot tell re-wording from deletion. The repair lane EDITS the incumbent, so
// a distinctive word it drops really is a detail removed or blurred.
