/**
 * Tests for the one-line rendering of a deterministic verdict on a standing
 * text, written for the run log.
 *
 * WHAT THESE PIN: each of the verdict's three kinds renders on its own line,
 * so a consolidation warning names the rule that refused a standing rather
 * than saying only that it "fails publication eligibility", which is what
 * the 2026-09-04 luxuanwen3 log said about a link destination the archive
 * had rewritten.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
