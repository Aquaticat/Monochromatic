/**
 Guards ledger H8 and the probe half of S18: the introduced-defect prober
 reads the declared names, the community renderings and the page apparatus
 rule.

 The refinement probe's verdict can roll a whole slice back, and it read no
 declared names, so a refinement using a declared name the ORIGINAL spells
 otherwise could read as an introduced substitution. It read no community
 renderings, so an edit losing the community's word for a term read as a
 neutral rewording. And its rule "Dropping wording the ORIGINAL never had is a
 correct repair" called deleting the page's own apparatus a repair, against
 the clause every writer and judge reads.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention.
