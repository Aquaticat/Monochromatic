//region Preservation check
// A deterministic, model-free gate against the failure mode that actually
// damaged shipped repairs: the editor is asked to change one quoted fragment
// and replaces a much larger span, silently dropping content nobody complained
// about.
//
// The rule is one sentence: everything in the replaced text that no accepted
// issue quoted as defective must still be present afterwards. What an issue
// DID quote is licensed to disappear, because changing it is the entire point
// of the edit.
//
// CALIBRATED ON REAL GRADED REPAIRS rather than chosen by taste. Over the 50
// drawn repairs of round three, 34 of them graded: this gate rejects the two
// regions a human read as damage (the Acheron edit, drawn four times as items
// 2, 7, 11 and 15, and the contributor-line edit at item 21), rejects one
// wholesale deletion at item 48, and rejects NONE of the 29 repairs graded
// sound. The separation is not marginal: the worst sound repair loses 57% of
// its unlicensed tokens, and the rejected one loses 92%.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT CATCH, stated so nobody expects it to. Rewording is not
// deletion. Item 37 turned "reminiscing" into "pleading", which is real damage
// and passes this gate, because the sentence is still represented. Catching
// that needs a meaning comparison, which is not deterministic.
