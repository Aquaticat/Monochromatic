//region Consolidation wrap
// APPLIES THE SEMANTIC WRAP TO A CONSOLIDATION THAT SHIPS, which is the one
// producing path with no assembly step to do it.
//
// The repair lane wraps in `repair-assemble.ts` and the translate lane in
// `translate-assemble.ts`, each at the single point its consumers read from.
// The consolidation stage has neither, so nothing re-applied the rule and
// whether a shipped consolidation carried semantic line breaks depended on
// what the producing model happened to emit.
//
// MEASURED BEFORE THIS EXISTED, across both runs of the band pair: seven of
// eleven shipped consolidations in one run and seven of twelve in the other
// lost the wrapping both lanes had, and the two runs disagreed about the same
// slice on identical inputs. `doc/planning/the-third-rendering.md` records it.
//
// DEMOTION IS RE-DERIVED RATHER THAN CARRIED, for the reason
// `wrapTranslateRecords` gives: a consolidation differing from the standing
// text only in its wrapping IS the standing text once wrapped, and shipping it
// as a consolidation would report a change nobody decided on.

 text keeps that wording byte for byte: wrapping it would turn a decision to
 change nothing into a change, which is what `wrapReplacementText` refuses by
 contract and what the delivery coherence check refuses by measurement.
 
 NEVER APPLIED TO A LINE-STRUCTURED SLICE EITHER, at this site or at the two
 lane sites. The pipeline hands a governed producer `TRANSLATE_LINE_STRUCTURE_RULE`,
 one output line per original line, and then broke that work afterwards: over
 the 211 line-structured slices of the pinned corpus the wrap changed 189 and
 broke 470 of 1091 lines, after every decider had approved them.

     change (ledger B26).

/**
 Wraps every proposal on a slate, so both deciders judge the bytes that ship.
 
 THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES, measured 2026-08-22 over the two most recent runs of
 the band pair's six entries: 15 of the 16 consolidations that shipped had
 their bytes changed by {@link wrapConsolidation} AFTER the slate judges had
 chosen them and the gate had approved them, 9 of 9 in one run and 6 of 7 in
 the other. Both deciders were reading text the run does not publish.
 
 THE SAME WRAPPER, AND NO CONFIGURATION TO DRIFT. `wrapReplacementText` takes
 a text and nothing else, so this cannot fall out of step with what
 {@link wrapConsolidation} applies afterwards. If the two ever did disagree,
 the candidate dedup would collapse proposals against bytes that never ship,
 which inverts the point of wrapping them early at all.
 
 SAFE TO APPLY TWICE, and it is applied twice: a winner wrapped here reaches
 {@link wrapConsolidation} and is wrapped again. Measured rather than assumed
 over twelve representative passages, seven of which the first application
 moved and none of which a second application moved again, and again on
 2026-09-29 over the 7,462 distinct texts of the stored comparison rows, 1,876
 of which the first application moved and none the second (ledger B26).
 
 THE INCUMBENT IS NEITHER WRAPPED NOR PASSED HERE. Wrapping text a lane
 decided to keep would report a change nobody decided on, which
 `wrapReplacementText`'s own contract refuses. The slate's key (`wordingKey`,
 ledger B26) reads both sides through the wrap instead, so a proposal that is
 a pure re-wrapping of an UNWRAPPED archive standing text collapses into it
 on the slate, and {@link wrapConsolidation}'s demotion still catches it
 after the gate.
 
 A GOVERNED SLICE IS LEFT ALONE, on the same evidence that stops the shipping
 wrap touching one: over the 211 line-structured slices of the pinned corpus
 this rule changes 189 and breaks 470 of the 1091 lines they already carry.
 Wrapping their proposals would put text in front of the judges that breaks
 the very rule they were given to enforce.
 
 @param voices - proposals that passed the validity floor
 
 @param lineStructured - whether the verse rule governs this slice, which
 forbids the wrap outright rather than narrowing it
 
 @returns Same voices carrying proposals as they would ship, or that array
 untouched where the verse rule governs
 
 @example
 ```ts
 const onTheSlate = wrapConsolidationProposals({ voices, lineStructured, },);
 ```
