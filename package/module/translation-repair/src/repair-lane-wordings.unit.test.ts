/**
 * Tests for the repair lane's per-slice wordings.
 *
 * WHAT THESE PIN is that this lane's silence at a passage the archive never
 * translated is reported as silence. It mends existing English, so where there
 * is none it has no work to do and no opinion to record; its settled outcome
 * carries the empty string for want of anything else, and passing that through
 * as a decision said the lane chose the wording it found. A lane comparison
 * then read that against a translate lane that had actually filled the passage
 * and reported the two lanes choosing DIFFERENT wordings.
 *
 * The second thing they pin is the intersection. The blocked exit settles a
 * prefix and stops, so an anchor before the crossing was reached and one after
 * it was not, and naming every anchor in the preparation would report the lane
 * as having visited slices it never got to.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
