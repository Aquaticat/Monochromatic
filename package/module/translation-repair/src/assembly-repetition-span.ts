//region Assembly repetition span
// GROWING WINDOWS INTO THE SPAN THEY BELONG TO, which is the step
// `assembly-repetition.ts` did not have and `#183` measured the cost of.
//
// That file finds repeats by counting fixed-length windows, longest first, and
// suppresses any phrase CONTAINED IN one already reported. That rule handles
// shorter-inside-longer and nothing else. A duplicated passage longer than the
// longest window it considers produces one finding per window position, all of
// the same length, so no one of them contains another and none suppresses any
// other. Measured on `vub171-20260822`'s `Zha_Ke`: one duplicated span of about
// 877 words reported as 866 findings, every one exactly 12 words.
//
// WHY THAT IS WORTH A MODULE RATHER THAN A FILTER. Findings are scorecard-stable
// tokens that get counted and compared across runs. One entry contributing 866
// of the corpus-wide 947 made every aggregate over that token a statement about
// one slice of one entry, so any rate or threshold read off it described the
// reporting shape rather than the corpus.
//
// THE MERGE RULE IS ABOUT OCCURRENCES, NOT ADJACENCY, and that distinction is
// the whole correctness argument. Two windows sitting next to each other in the
// document are not evidence of one repeat: they could be two different repeated
// passages that happen to abut. What makes them one repeat is that the second
// window occurs in exactly the places the first does, each advanced by one
// word. Merging on adjacency alone would join unrelated repeats into a single
// invented span; merging on the occurrence sets cannot, because two unrelated
// repeats do not repeat in the same places.
