/**
 * Tests for the wire-format choice.
 *
 * THE SILENT FAILURE IS THE WHOLE POINT. Draining a stream with a reader that
 * does not understand its grammar produces no error and no warning. The
 * scanner simply matches nothing, the answer channel stays empty, and every
 * runaway guard downstream reads a call that behaved perfectly and produced
 * nothing. That is indistinguishable from a model that declined, so a
 * misrouted stream would surface as a lost voice and be blamed on a provider.
 *
 * The cases below therefore assert the WRONG reader sees nothing, not only
 * that the right one sees something. Only the pair proves the choice matters.
