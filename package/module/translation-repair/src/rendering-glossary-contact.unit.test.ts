/**
 Guards class one hundred fifty-eight (aiyysk2, 2026-09-26): under the
 owner's standing instruction of 2026-09-25 ("whenever you see anything that
 can be translated better do it"), 交往 joins the rendering glossary. A
 narrator who had never spent time with trans women, and was too shy to
 approach them, shipped as someone who had "never dated a trans woman", a
 romance the original never states. The glossary seeds English for ordinary
 social contact. It refused the dating reading until the glossary audit of
 2026-09-27, which dropped the refusal: 交往 does mean dating where the
 passage speaks of romance, so the entry's why carries the condition
 (`glossary-dictionary-terms.unit.test.ts` passes "dated" there).

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
