// WHY A VOICE WAS LOST, in a form a run log can be grouped by.
//
// Every abandonment used to read the same: `abandoned 180000ms after quorum`,
// followed by whatever the platform called its abort. That is one line for at
// least three situations which want OPPOSITE remedies, and no run log could
// separate them:
//
//   a call that never got a first byte is queueing or admission, and wants the
//   straggler dropped or replaced;
//
//   a call cut off part way through was working, and wants a longer window or a
//   smaller slate;
//
//   a call we ended ourselves had stopped saying anything new, and wants
//   neither, because waiting longer buys more of the same.
//
// `#118` made the evidence available by keeping what the stream delivered.
// This reads it. Without this the information exists on the error and nothing
// looks at it, which is the failure `#71` names: telemetry written and never
// read is worse than none, because it looks like the question is covered.
