/**
 Supplies factual support without making neighboring passages additional translation obligations.

 THE DECLARED NAMES AND THE REFERENCES ARE HERE TOO (ledger S14): the critic
 filed and the panel accepted issues with both on their sheets, and the
 judges choosing among the repairs of those issues had neither, so a repair
 respelling a declared name or stripping a detail a cited page states could
 win.

 @param neighbouringSourceText - local source evidence for interpreting current claims

 @param documentSourceText - same-entry original checking claims outside the local window

 @param identityContext - declared names and handles from both front matters

 @param referenceContext - what the pages the original cites say

 @returns Additional evidence blocks in the measured order

 @example
 ```ts
 const evidence = repairSelectionSourceEvidence({ neighbouringSourceText, documentSourceText });
 ```
