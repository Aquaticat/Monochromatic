/**
 * Tests that the repair slice driver FORWARDS `#107`'s neighbouring window to
 * the sheets its stages send.
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE FILE FROM `nearby-window-reaches-the-models.unit.test.ts`.
 * That one hands each builder a window directly and asserts the builder renders
 * it, which is the right test of a builder and says nothing about whether
 * anything ever hands one over. `repairChunk` builds the fragment those four
 * call sites spread, and its own forwarding is what this pins.
 *
 * WHAT WAS MEASURED. On 2026-08-25, inverting this driver's conditional spread
 * so the neighbouring ORIGINAL is forwarded only when it is ABSENT failed no
 * test in this package. Every builder case stayed green, because each is handed
 * its window by hand. A driver that dropped it would leave the critic reasoning
 * about a slice alone while the key that names its work claims a window: the
 * exact shape `#126` had, where the slice key mislabelled its window sides.
 *
 * THE CRITIC IS ENOUGH TO PIN IT. All four stages spread ONE fragment, built
 * once, which the module says is deliberate: a critic that can see next door
 * raises a relocation claim and a panel that cannot rejects it as unfounded. A
 * run whose critics report nothing settles right after that phase, so scripting
 * one stage exercises the forwarding without buying the other three.
 *
 * BOTH DIRECTIONS ARE PINNED, since a driver pasting the blocks unconditionally
 * would satisfy the first case alone.
 *
 * NO NETWORK. The client scripts every critic with an empty report and records
 * the sheet each was sent.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
