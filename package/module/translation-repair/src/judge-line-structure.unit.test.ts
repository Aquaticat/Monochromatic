/**
 Guards ledger S15 on the lane contest and the consolidate gate: a judge
 weighing candidates over a line-structured original is told what the line
 rule asks, and only there.

 The producers and editors were told to keep every original line and the
 translate slate carried the line criterion, but the two sheets deciding which
 rendering ships carried no line rule and no bilingual clause, so a candidate
 merging the lines a producer had been told to keep could win on wording.

 THE KEY NAMES THE RULE, since the question now differs: two slices with
 identical texts in different chunks can differ in whether the rule governs,
 and ballots bought without the clause must not answer for a sheet with it.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention.
