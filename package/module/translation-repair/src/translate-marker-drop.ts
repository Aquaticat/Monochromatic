// CLASS NINETY-TWO (XingZ626, 2026-09-23). The original's line about the
// rhythm-game song carries [^3], and the archive never rendered that note.
// The repair lane wrote the line from the archive's text without the marker,
// the contest chose that lane, the slate's proposals carrying the marker lost
// the gate 2 to 1, and no floor had asked for it. The definition, translated
// in the admitted tail (class fifty-nine), was then trimmed as an orphan at
// both assemblies and the note left the page, where XingZ625 had shipped it
// only because the translate lane won the same slice. A marker the ORIGINAL
// passage carries is the passage's structure, like its links and its hard
// breaks: a candidate without it is refused before any judge reads it, and
// the finding tells the writer to keep the marker and leave the definition
// out. The other direction stays open: the page may cite a note the original
// never had (the page's own apparatus, class eighty-five), so a marker the
// candidate carries beyond the original's is no fault here.
