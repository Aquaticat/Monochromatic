/**
 Tests for the Charm Hyper catalog.
 
 THIS FILE PINS MEASUREMENTS, not preferences. Every value it checks came from
 live calls, and each one is a value that a plausible reading of provider
 docs could get wrong: model answer ceiling can sit below bound `#156`,
 and provider-specific image input support must be read rather than inferred.
 
 A CHANGED VALUE HERE IS A PROVIDER CHANGE, so these cases are meant to fail
 loudly rather than be updated to match.
