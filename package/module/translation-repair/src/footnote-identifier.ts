//region Footnote identifier
// One spelling for one footnote, so the parser and the raw scanners agree.
//
// Markdown decides that `[^Note]` and `[^note]` name the SAME footnote, and
// mdast hands back the folded spelling on every node it builds. Everything this
// package finds by scanning text instead, unresolved references and the
// per-slice mention counts the assembly guard attributes with, sees the source
// spelling. Left alone, the two never meet: the guard looks up a finding about
// `note` in a mention map keyed `Note`, finds nothing, blames no slice, and
// withdraws every repair in the document. Measured on 2026-08-15 against a
// two-replacement fixture: both were withdrawn, including one that touched no
// footnote at all.
//
// The corpus at pin a41fc60 cannot trigger this. All 209 of its GFM markers are
// numeric, where folding is identity. A model writing `[^note]` into a
// replacement triggers it immediately, which is why this is not left to the
// corpus to decide.
