/**
 Guards that the provider's own words, kept on `SyntheticHttpError.bodyExcerpt`,
 are read only by the files that have a reason to.

 WHY IT MATTERS. The field holds the opening of a provider's reply body. It is
 withheld from a marked subclass's message so no refusal printer repeats it,
 and it reaches a log line only through `exchangeFailureLogText`. A new reader
 that copies it into a stored record, a thrown message or a printed report
 would undo both, so a file that names the field must be listed here with the
 reason it may.

 WHAT IT READS. The text of every production file, comments included, for the
 word `bodyExcerpt`; a mention in a comment is listed too, so the comment is
 read when the field's readers change. A reader that reaches the field through
 another name (a destructuring rename, a copy into another binding) still
 names it once, at the read. It cannot see a reader that receives the text
 from one of the listed files.

 THE FIXTURE CASE COMES FIRST, so the package-wide case is read against a scan
 shown able to find a reader. Fixtures are cat-themed.
