//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The first live pass with OpenRouter in the order
// (keyword233, 2026-09-03) cut `deepseek-v4-pro-0813` twice, gemma twice and
// `deepseek-v4-flash-0731` once, and answered 16 of 31 MiniMax M3 calls with
// an empty content channel, and nothing in the log said which of the model's
// seven zero-data-retention endpoints had served any of them. The MiniMax
// case took a per-endpoint probe to pin on Parasail; the cut streams are
// still unattributed. Every chat completion chunk the gateway sends carries
// the upstream's name at the top level (`"provider":"ModelRun"`, captured
// 2026-09-03), so the attribution was on the wire all along.
