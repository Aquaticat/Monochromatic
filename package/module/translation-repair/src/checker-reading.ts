// summed away.
//
// WHY THE BOOLEAN WAS NOT ENOUGH. `RepairIssueRecord.resolved` is the milestone's
// headline number and the input to candidate selection, and it is a majority
// verdict. A settled artifact carrying only the verdict cannot say whether that
// majority was unanimous or one vote wide, cannot say who dissented, and cannot
// be re-read at another roster width without buying the whole stage again. The
// introduced-defect probe already keeps its tallies and roster sizes per issue
// for exactly this reason; the stage that decides what ships kept less.
