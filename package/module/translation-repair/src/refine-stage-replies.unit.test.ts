/**
 Tests for what one heard rewriter's reply comes to before the judges see it:
 bound to the sheet, read by the atom gate, applied to the slice, and ordered
 by the roster.

 The stage's own cases (`refine-stage.unit.test.ts`) reach these through a
 whole run; these hold the refusals the patch can give a hand-built reply,
 which no run produces.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention.
