 its offset; one in the shared text after it moves by the difference in the

 Finds the withdrawal that moves the first strict-grammar refusal furthest

 The parser names where it stopped; a withdrawal after which it stops later
 removed the break it named, and the guard's next round reads what is left.
 Nothing is chosen when the page parses already or when no withdrawal moves
 the refusal.

 BOTH OFFSETS ARE READ ON THE PAGE AS ASSEMBLED (ledger B85). The page with a
 replacement withdrawn is another text, longer or shorter by what the
 withdrawal changed, so a break after the withdrawn slice sits at another
 offset there without having moved; read raw, a whole replacement much
 shorter than its archive text ranked as moving a break it never touched,
 above the withdrawal that removed it. A withdrawal after which the grammar
 accepts the page outranks every one that only moves the refusal.
