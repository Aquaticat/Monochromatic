/**
 Guards class one hundred twenty-two (shi_Yumiaoya23, 2026-09-25): the
 reader-protection rule was on every sheet and the page still said she took
 "three bottles of some kind of sedative-hypnotic" before she died, and that
 she went up to "the rooftop of a tall building" to end her life. The judges
 read a drug class as vague because it named no drug, read the rule as
 covering only the medication that was the means, and marked down the one
 candidate that wrote "a large amount of medication" as over-vague. The owner
 answered on 2026-09-25 that not showing suicide methods is expected. The
 rule now says that a class of drug is a substance and a count is a dose
 whether or not the drug is the means, and that a place which is itself the
 means is a method.

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
