//region Writer grace override
// Gives the WRITER rounds a longer straggler window than the reader rounds,
// built in since 2026-09-06, and lets one invocation move it without a
// rebuild.
//
// A WRITER ROUND LOSES A CANDIDATE; A READER ROUND LOSES A BALLOT. The editor,
// refiner, translate and consolidate gathers ask each seat for text, and every
// voice the window cuts is one fewer candidate for the judges to choose among.
// The critic, panel, judge, checker and probe gathers ask eight or so seats for
// a reading of text that already exists, and the last voice to arrive adds one
// ballot to seven. The two are not the same wait, and the 2026-09-01 seating
// showed why one window cannot serve both: the editor calibration seated the
// two slowest models as editors on their text, and the four-entry pass then
// ran under `TRANSLATION_REPAIR_STRAGGLER_GRACE_MS=60000` for the reader
// rounds' sake, which cut the top editor mid-reply in the pass's first editor
// round. A window sized for the eight-wide rounds unseats the writers the
// three-wide rounds were seated on.
//
// A BUILT-IN OF ITS OWN SINCE 2026-09-06. The dial landed on 2026-09-02 as a
// launch-time setting so the round window's decision record stayed unchanged,
// and every page that shipped afterwards ran its writers at 180000 ms through
// it while the round window was the owner's 120000 ms of 2026-09-03. A
// production launch that depended on an operator remembering the variable was
// the same defect the pass overlap fallback had, so the owner made the figure
// the built-in (`doc/decision/translation-repair-straggler-grace.md`, decision
// of 2026-09-06). Writers never wait less than every other round: when the
// round window is the longer one, as under the editor calibration's 300000 ms,
// the writers follow it.
//
// UNSET AND BLANK BOTH MEAN "the built-in, or the round window when that is
// longer", and anything else unreadable refuses as a stated refusal, by the
// rule `readWindowDial` holds for both dials.
