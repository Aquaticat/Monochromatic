//region Slice record agreement
// Whether a slice record's changed flag agrees with its own text, checked
// wherever a record is accepted: on the way out of a stage, and on the way back
// in from a cache.
//
// Both lanes store a decided text beside a boolean saying whether that text
// differs from the archive's, and those two can contradict each other. From a
// CACHE it is a truncated write that still parses, a hand edit, or a slicing
// that moved while the key did not. From a STAGE it is a derivation reading
// something other than the text, which is what both lanes did until they were
// changed to read the text itself.
//
// CHECKED WHERE THE RECORD IS ACCEPTED rather than only at assembly, and the
// two cases want opposite answers. A cached record is DISCARDED and the slice
// recomputed: one bad file should cost one slice rather than the whole document
// after every other slice has been bought. A fresh record is REFUSED outright,
// because recomputing it would ask the same code the same question.
//
// WHAT ASSEMBLY CATCHES IS ONLY HALF OF IT, which is why this exists at all. A
// record claiming a change it did not make becomes a replacement carrying the
// archive wording, and `assertReplacementsChange` refuses it. A record DENYING a
// change it did make never becomes a replacement, so assembly sees nothing at
// all: the text is dropped in silence while the per-slice ledger still reports
// it. That direction has no other check anywhere.
