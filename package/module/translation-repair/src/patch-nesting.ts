//region Patch nesting
// A PATCH IS REFUSED FOR WHAT THE TEXT WOULD BE, not for what the editor wrote: the
// text the patch leaves is read against the nesting bound as the parser will
// read it, so the refusal of an unreadable edit belongs to the voice that wrote
// it and no later parse of the chunk can raise it again.

/**
 Reads the text an edit leaves, written beside the edits already accepted,
 against the nesting bound.

 THE WHOLE TEXT IS READ, not the replacement alone, since a replacement that
 reads on its own can still nest past the bound inside the markers around it.
 Plain markdown is the grammar asked: the document parse downgrades to it, so
 a text it refuses is a text nothing reads.

 @param targetText - text the edits are written into

 @param accepted - edits already accepted, disjoint from the candidate

 @param candidate - the edit being judged

 @returns Where the text the edits leave first passes the bound, or that it
 stays within

 @example
 ```ts
 const reading = nestingWithEdit({ targetText: 'A cat.', accepted: [], candidate: { start: 0, end: 6, text: 'A kitten.', }, },);
 // => { kind: 'within', }
 ```
