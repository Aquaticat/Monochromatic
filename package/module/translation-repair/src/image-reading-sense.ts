// WHETHER A MODEL'S READING OF A PICTURE IS ABOUT THE RIGHT PICTURE AT ALL.
//
// The pipeline supplies the image so a transcribed passage has a source that can be
// checked, and falls back to protecting the block structurally "whenever an
// image's OCR doesn't make sense". The rule is written out in
// `doc/planning/when-an-image-reading-makes-no-sense.md`; this is that rule and
// nothing more.
//
// THE BRANCHES ARE NOT SYMMETRIC, and the asymmetry sets the threshold.
// Trusting a bad reading licenses replacing a human's careful transcription
// with something derived from a misreading, and the judges cannot tell, because
// the reading is the only evidence they are given about the picture. Falling
// back costs nothing that exists today: the block is protected and left alone,
// which is where every transcript already stands. So a reading has to earn its
// use, which is the opposite of how a defect detector should be tuned and
// follows from the costs rather than from taste.
//
// THIS DOES NOT JUDGE TRANSLATION QUALITY. Whether the reading renders the
// picture well is the judges' question and they are equipped for it. This
// decides only whether the reading is a reading at all.
//
// WHETHER IT IS THE RIGHT PICTURE IS DECIDED ELSEWHERE, in
// `reading-corroboration.ts`, by comparing the two readers' readings to each
// other. A clause here used to compare the reading against the transcript the
// archive already carried, and real traffic on 2026-08-19 measured it refusing
// correct readings: every reading of `Mio/7`'s two pictures was refused while
// the two readers agreed with each other at 0.967 and 1.000 character overlap.
// It also could not work in principle, since a reading comes back in the
// picture's language and the transcript is English, so the two can share only
// names, handles and numbers. What survives here is per-reading and needs no
// second text.

 Shortest reading worth having, in solid characters: non-whitespace code
 points, counted by `solidCharacters`.

 An image nobody could read comes back as an apology or as nothing, and both
 are shorter than any transcript.

 ONE LINE, ONE COUNT. A model's reading and the deterministic reader's text
 are both held to this line by `solidCharacters` and by nothing else, so a
 picture is never short by one measure and long by the other: inner whitespace
 adds nothing to a reading, and an astral character (two UTF-16 units) is one.

 Counts what is left of a text once whitespace is dropped.

 A LINEAR SCAN rather than a pattern, per `RG1`: the rule is "characters that

 backtrack. It walks code points, so an astral character counts once.

 THE COUNT `MIN_READING_CHARS` IS MEASURED IN, beside the constant for that
 reason: the reading screen here and the deterministic reader's presence line
 in `image-ocr.ts` ask the same question of the same count.
