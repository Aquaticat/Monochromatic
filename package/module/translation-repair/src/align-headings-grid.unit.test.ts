/**
 * Tests for where the heading-affinity grid draws its trust line.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `#71` recorded what a wrong section pairing costs: on
 * one entry every critic call compared the wrong original against the wrong
 * translation, so every issue filed was noise and every repair damaged correct
 * text. The grid is what stops that, and the type's own words are "pairings AT
 * OR ABOVE threshold". On 2026-08-25 moving the comparison so that a pairing
 * landing exactly ON the threshold became untrusted failed no test here.
 *
 * HALF IS NOT A CORNER CASE. Affinity is shared Latin runs over the smaller
 * heading's run count, so a Chinese heading carrying a romanised name beside
 * one other run, matched against an English heading carrying that name beside
 * one other, scores exactly one half. That is the ordinary shape of a memorial
 * page's section heading, not a constructed edge.
 *
 * BOTH SIDES OF THE LINE ARE PINNED, since a grid trusting everything would
 * satisfy the first case alone.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
