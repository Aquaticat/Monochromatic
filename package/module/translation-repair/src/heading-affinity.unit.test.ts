/**
 * Tests for the heading affinity that drives section alignment.
 *
 * These moved here from `align-sections-order.unit.test.ts` when that
 * prototype was deleted. The functions under test are LIVE, reached through
 * `align-headings-grid.ts` and so through the shipped forced aligner; only the
 * prototype that shared their old test file was superseded. Leaving them in a
 * file named for deleted code is how live coverage gets thrown away with dead
 * code one day.
 *
 * Fixtures mirror the corpus shape that motivated the aligner; names are the
 * real ones, since the whole point is that handles survive translation.
