// missing information even PRESENT in the Chinese source? A sentence the
// original translator embellished beyond the Chinese can never be fully
// restored by a faithful zh-anchored editor, so "partial" is its correct
// ceiling and the strict rate under-reports the pipeline. The probe reuses
// the numbered-judgment-sheet wire shape of the restoration judge; only the
// question, the verdict vocabulary, and the resolution differ.

- derivable: every piece of the candidate's information is stated in, or directly inferable from, the ORIGINAL
- partially-derivable: some of the candidate's information is grounded in the ORIGINAL, but some is not (translator embellishment)
- not-derivable: the candidate's information is mostly absent from the ORIGINAL

Judge INFORMATION, not wording. Style, word order, and phrasing never matter; only whether the facts and details are grounded.

Reply with ONLY a JSON object of shape {"judgments": [{"reference": 1, "verdict": "derivable"}]}. No prose, no code fences.
