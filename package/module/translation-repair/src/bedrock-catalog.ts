//region Bedrock catalog
// What Amazon Bedrock serves for this pipeline, how it spells it, where it
// routes it and what it charges.
//
// WHY THIS PROVIDER EXISTS IN THE PIPELINE. The owner, 2026-09-07: "I have
// 200USD of credits in my Amazon Bedrock account. With ZDR enabled, only these
// models are usable (and approved): Claude Sonnet 5, Gemma 4 E2B, Gemma 4 31B,
// Gemma 4 26B-A4B, GPT OSS 120B"; then "The credits in my Amazon Bedrock
// account will expire early next year, so you're allowed to use it as much as
// you like. But I will NEVER top it up"; then "I retract Sonnet 5. Looks like
// Amazon didn't properly display it as not supporting ZDR." It is the fourth
// provider in `PROVIDER_ORDER`, ahead of OpenRouter, since its credits are
// prepaid and expiring where OpenRouter's are the owner's to top up.
//
// RAW FETCH, NO SDK. The owner, 2026-09-07: "Please do not introduce Amazon
// Bedrock SDK, Anthropic SDK, OpenAI SDK because these are poorly written. Use
// raw fetch." The client rides the same transport seam as the other three.
//
// TWO ROUTES ON ONE HOST, MEASURED 2026-09-07 with the bearer key in us-east-1
// (probes under `~/temp/agent`, recorded in
// `doc/planning/translation-repair-openrouter-2026-09-03.md`). The three Gemma
// 4 sizes answer only under `/openai/v1/chat/completions`; the default
// `/v1/chat/completions` says "model isn't supported on this route", and each
// model card says "On bedrock-mantle, this model is served at /openai/v1".
// gpt-oss-120b answers only under `/v1/chat/completions` and its card gives
// that base. Both stream, both report `usage` on the last chunk, and both
// honoured a json_schema `response_format`. The Gemma streams end on
// `data: [DONE]`; the gpt-oss stream ends on its usage chunk with no sentinel,
// so the terminator is a per-model fact here.
//
// CLAUDE SONNET 5 IS NOT SERVED, by measurement before the owner's retraction:
// mantle listed it but its chat, responses and messages routes refused it, and
// bedrock-runtime answered 403 "not available for this account".
//
// THE ACCOUNT IS IN DATA-RETENTION MODE `none`: every listed model reported
// `data_retention.mode: "none", source: "account"` on `/v1/models`, and a
// request carrying `store` answered "This account requires store=false for
// this model". Chat completions store nothing and the client sends no `store`.
//
// PRICES ARE THE PUBLIC PRICING PAGE'S, read 2026-09-07, US regions: Gemma 4
// E2B 0.04 in and 0.08 out per million tokens, Gemma 4 31B 0.14 and 0.40,
// Gemma 4 26B-A4B 0.13 and 0.40; gpt-oss-120b 0.1545 and 0.618 as the page
// listed for Sydney, the one region it showed. The ledger meters the owner's
// 200 USD off these, since the account exposes no balance endpoint to a
// bearer key.
//
// THE GEMMA 4 CARDS REPORT IMAGE INPUT AND THE CATALOG SAID FALSE until a
// transcription through this serving stack was measured, for the reason the
// OpenRouter catalog gives for the same model. Measured 2026-09-08 02:20 UTC
// over nine pictures the seated readers had corroborated (planning log,
// "The three Gemma sizes against the seated readers"): 26B-A4B and 31B
// produced eight readings each and every one was corroborated by every
// seated reader, so both read pictures here; E2B produced two readings no
// seated reader corroborated and stays a text seat. gpt-oss-120b reads no
// pictures anywhere. A 1.27 MB picture came back as an empty stream from all
// three sizes; the reader stage records that reader as `empty-reply`.
//
// NO PUBLISHED OUTPUT CEILING FOR GEMMA 4. The model cards give context
// windows (128K for E2B, 256K for the other two) and no maximum output; the
// context window stands in and the measured answer bound applies as it does
// everywhere else. gpt-oss-120b's card says 16K.
