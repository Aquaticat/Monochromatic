// change: destinations, identifiers, code, numbers, and foreign-language runs.
//
// They are compared as an ORDERED SEQUENCE, never as a multiset. A multiset
// admits swaps that pass the gate while changing what the text says: "3 cats
// and 5 dogs" becoming "5 cats and 3 dogs", two links exchanging destinations,
// two names exchanging positions. Order is what makes those fail.
//
// Numbers and foreign runs are NOT mdast nodes, so they are scanned out of text
// leaves only, never out of Markdown syntax. Scanning the raw source would find
// digits inside link destinations and inline code and report changes that never
// happened.
