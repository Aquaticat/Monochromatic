/**
 Tests for the final polish's configuration.

 WHAT THIS FILE PINS: a roster with refiners, which every corpus run seats
 (`RunRepairModels`), configures the polish from its refiners and judges, the
 gate bench and the prepared document. A roster without refiners has no
 builder: the one that answered it with a disabled kind lost its last
 production caller when the pass began building through this one (ledger T8).

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
