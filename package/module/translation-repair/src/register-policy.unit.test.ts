/**
 Guards class one hundred twenty-eight (owner, 2026-09-25: "I'm not sure why
 you allowed the very informal terms like OD to go through."): the house
 policy said how to render community vocabulary and told the bench to keep
 "an abbreviation local to the person's world", but said nothing about the
 register of the English itself, so chat shorthand the ORIGINAL writes (OD,
 jk, TGT) reached the page as "ODing", "jk skirt" and "the TGT series", and
 no judge held it against a candidate. The rule now says the page is plain
 written English whatever the ORIGINAL's register, spells out shorthand, and
 reaches the writers' and the judges' sheets.

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
