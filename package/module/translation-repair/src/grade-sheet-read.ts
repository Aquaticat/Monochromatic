//region Graded sheet reading
// Reading a human's filled-in detection sheet back into verdicts.
//
// Built for calibration: the plan of record is to pre-grade a round BLIND, hand
// the untouched sheet to the human, and derive an agreement rate from the two
// sets of grades afterwards. The pre-grades deliberately never appear ON the
// sheet. Printing them there would anchor the human toward agreeing, and the
// precision number that same sheet produces is the milestone gate, so the
// calibration would be bought by corrupting the measurement it calibrates
// against. Nothing is lost by keeping them apart, because the agreed plan only
// starts filtering items a round LATER anyway.
//
// The parsing rules come from the two sheets already graded, not from a format
// anyone specified. They differ from each other and both must be read:
//
//   ### 3. grade: Y  (Y = real defect ...)          round one, bare
//   ### 2. grade: N. <rationale>  (Y = ...)         round one, verdict then prose
//   ### 4. grade: [Y]  (Y = ...)                    round two, bracketed
//   ### 7. grade: [Y, <rationale>]  (Y = ...)       round two, bracketed with prose
//   ### 10. grade: [Not enough context to grade]    neither verdict
//
// That last shape is why a verdict letter is only a verdict when a delimiter
// follows it. "Not enough context to grade" begins with N, and reading it as a
// false positive would silently move a real measurement into the denominator on
// the strength of one letter.
