/**
 Tests the wall-clock stub (ledger B78, M100): a case that sets the clock
 reads its own reading through its awaits, and a case the suite runs beside it
 reads the real clock. The first form of the stub replaced `Date.now` for the
 whole process, and a pacer in a sibling case read the stepped clock and
 slept on it.

 THE REAL CLOCK IS READ WITH `new Date()`, which takes the current time from
 the engine rather than through the `Date.now` property (ECMA-262, the `Date`
 constructor called with no arguments), so its stamps bracket a reading of
 `Date.now` whatever the stub does. This file and the stub are the two that
 `wall-clock-reads.unit.test.ts` lets name the wall clock.
