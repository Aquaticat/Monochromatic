//region Refusal text
// Renders a caught value as text that carries no quoted content.
//
// V8 GIVES A `JSON.parse` REFUSAL A MESSAGE THAT QUOTES THE TEXT IT REFUSED,
// ten characters of it, so forwarding a caught error's message is a disclosure
// decision and not a formatting one. `#220` was this same mechanism reaching a
// terminal past an absent catch; `#224` is it reaching one through a catch that
// repeats the message.
//
// NOT A SECOND `caughtValueText`. That function answers "what does this value
// say". This one answers "may this value's message be repeated". The house rule
// prefers `caughtValueText` wherever the first question is the one being asked,
// and a site forwarding a parse failure into a log or a stored record is asking
// the second.
//
// A DECLARED FIELD RATHER THAN A SYMBOL. A symbol key would refuse a forged
// marker outright, but `--isolatedDeclarations` cannot emit a computed
// property name (TS9038), and the `Error.isError` gate already rejects every
// plain object a run file could carry. What remains is an Error someone wrote
// the field onto deliberately, which is the same trust a symbol import gives.
//
// A MARKER RATHER THAN A LIST OF TRUSTED CLASSES. A central list has to be
// edited by whoever adds an error class, and the cost of forgetting is that a
// quoting message ships. A class that opts in states the property beside the
// message it builds, where the two can be read against each other.
//
// FAILS CLOSED. An unmarked class, a foreign Error, and a thrown non-Error all
// take the naming branch, so the only way to leak through here is to mark a
// class whose message quotes. Two copies of this module would not share a
// symbol, which costs a message rather than disclosing one.
