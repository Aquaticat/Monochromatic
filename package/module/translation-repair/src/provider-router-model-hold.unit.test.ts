/**
 Guards class sixty-four (XingZ613, 2026-09-19): a model whose upstream
 endpoint rate-limited it (class sixty-two's passed-on 429) was asked again
 on every round, and every round waited its five-attempt ladder out in grace;
 the repair lane took 1h39m against XingZ608's 35m. The router now holds
 that one model out for the rate-limit backoff and refuses it at call time
 as unreachable, so a round neither asks nor waits for it, while every other
 model on the same provider is served and the provider's own budget is
 untouched. Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
