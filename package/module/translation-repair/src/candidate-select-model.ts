/**
 * Weight a judge's ballot carries when it names a candidate that judge helped
 * write.
 *
 * Self-judging is ALWAYS allowed, by user decision on 2026-08-14: these models
 * have different blind spots, and a producer's reading of its own text is a
 * weaker instrument than a disinterested reading, not a worthless one. Barring
 * producers threw that reading away and, on a six-model roster with three
 * producers, halved the panel to do it.
 *
 * What the discount corrects is a TILT rather than a declared preference. The
 * judge sheet is anonymized and says so, so a producer does not know which
 * candidate is its own and cannot set out to back it; it is only somewhat more
 * likely to land there. Sizing this as though every self-vote were deliberate
 * would overcorrect a bias nobody has measured on this roster yet, which is
 * what `#84` is for.
 *
 * A half rather than some tuned fraction, and the arithmetic is the argument:
 * one author draws at most this much for its own text and three authors at most
 * three halves, both short of {@link MIN_SELECTION_WEIGHT}, while FOUR reach it
 * exactly. So up to three stakeholders a candidate needs a judge with no stake
 * in it, and at four it does not.
 *
 * That four-stakeholder case is reached by COLLAPSE rather than by a wide
 * producing role: models returning byte-identical text merge into one candidate
 * carrying every author, so four models writing the same sentence can ship it
 * between themselves. Kept deliberately, because independent models agreeing to
 * the byte is itself the corroboration an outside judge would supply. Both it
 * and the three-author case that falls short are pinned by
 * `runCollapsedSelection` in `candidate-select.unit.test.ts`, so retuning either
 * weight fails there rather than moving the bound in silence.
 *
 * STATED PRECISELY, because a looser version of this sentence was written into
 * four documents and was wrong: the discount attaches to a JUDGE AND CANDIDATE
 * PAIR, not to a judge. A producer voting for someone else's candidate carries
 * full weight, which is the whole point of seating it.
 *
 * Exactly representable in binary floating point, which the tie comparison
 * depends on: two halves sum to one with no residue, so a tie between a
 * self-supported candidate and an equally supported rival still reads as a tie.

 * every contributor still has a stake in it.
 *

 * independently produced the SAME text and their candidates were collapsed:
 * more than one model has a stake either way, and every one of them holds it.
 * What the variant means precisely is "more than one model has a stake in this

 *
 * The incumbent variant is text that was ALREADY THERE: a human translation the
 * translate lane offers as one candidate among the fresh ones. Nobody on the
 * roster wrote it, so no judge is discounted for it, and the alternative of
 * giving it a stand-in model id would both discount a model that never saw it
