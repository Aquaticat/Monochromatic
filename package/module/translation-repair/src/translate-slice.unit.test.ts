/**
 * Tests for the hop between one settled slice and the stage that settles it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS EXISTS TO CATCH, and why a test rather than a check at run time.
 * `#108` compares one slice judged twice, differing only in whether the judges
 * were shown the neighbouring original. `translate-stage.unit.test.ts` proves
 * the stage renders that window into its sheets, and
 * `translate-slice-key.unit.test.ts` proves the cache separates the two arms.
 * Neither proves that {@link settleTranslateSlice} passes the window ON. A
 * parameter that silently went nowhere would produce two identical arms, and
 * the measurement would report a confident null after fifteen hundred calls.
 * That is the failure this file makes impossible.
 *
 * IT ALSO PINS WHO SEES IT. The window is context for the judges; the
 * translators are not shown it and must not be, since a translator that read
 * the neighbouring original might render it and earn a coverage complaint for
 * content that was never its slice.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention mirroring corpus structure only.
