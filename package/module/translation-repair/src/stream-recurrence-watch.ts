//region Stream recurrence watch
// CATCHES A PERIOD THE RATIO DETECTOR CANNOT SEE. `watchForDegeneration`
// samples fixed-width windows every WINDOW_STRIDE characters, so its
// sensitivity depends on gcd(period, WINDOW_STRIDE) rather than on how
// repetitive the text actually is: a model looping a 501-character
// paragraph forever reads as healthy at 0.1223 distinct, one character
// shorter reads as degenerate, and nothing about the text differs in kind.
// Probed directly against the built detector with no rebuild and no quota,
// the predicted window count matched the observed one in all fifteen cases
// tried.
//
// THIS DOES NOT DEPEND ON THE PERIOD'S ARITHMETIC. It keeps the trailing
// text itself, in a bounded buffer, and asks whether the most recent
// characters occur earlier in it. A stream looping with any period shorter
// than the buffer answers yes eventually, whatever the period, and ordinary
// prose never repeats a block that long verbatim. It complements the ratio
// rather than replacing it: the ratio catches short cycling on a small
// sample, this catches the longer periods the ratio's sampling arithmetic
// is blind to.
//
// ONE HIT MUST NOT BE A VERDICT. Reasoning traces in this pipeline restate
// whole source slices and whole candidates verbatim, so a model quoting a
// long candidate a second time inside one thinking trace is ordinary work,
// and a single recurrence reading as a loop would cost a voice for doing
// its job. The verdict requires the recurrence to persist across several
// consecutive checks as the stream grows, which a genuine loop does forever
// and a bounded quotation cannot.
//
// GATED BEHIND THE SAME LENGTH BAR THE RATIO DETECTOR USES, per
// `MIN_CHARS_FOR_VERDICT`. A genuine loop never stops, so it always crosses
// the bar eventually; every legitimate reply, verse refrains included,
// stays under it and is never judged by this detector any more than by the
// ratio one.

 * A QUARTER OF {@link BUFFER_CHARS}, not half, and that headroom is

 * `earlier` is long enough to let the match slide to the right offset: with
 * `earlier` fixed at `BUFFER_CHARS - TAIL_CHARS`, the room to slide is
 * `earlier.length - tail.length`, which is `BUFFER_CHARS - 2 * TAIL_CHARS`.
 * At half the buffer that room is zero, so `.includes()` can only match at
 * one exact offset, which requires that offset to be a multiple of the
 * period by coincidence rather than by construction, missing most periods
 * including 501. At a quarter it is 2048, which is at least as wide as any
 * period up to 2048 characters, so the sliding search is guaranteed to land
 * on a matching offset somewhere in range for any period that short,
 * covering the 410 to 1001-character periods the ratio detector's window
 * arithmetic misses. Periods longer than this room stay out of reach of any
 * buffer this size, which this package's own decision record accepts: "any
 * period shorter than the buffer."
 *
 * THE SAME HEADROOM ALSO BOUNDS A BACK-TO-BACK DUPLICATION'S FALSE-POSITIVE
 * REACH. A block of length L recurring immediately back-to-back is only
 * findable while L is at least TAIL_CHARS (so the checked slice sits
 * entirely inside repeated content) and at most `BUFFER_CHARS - TAIL_CHARS`
 * (so the earlier copy has not yet scrolled out of the buffer), a window
 * `BUFFER_CHARS - 2 * TAIL_CHARS` wide. Whatever period detection needs that
 * window to be, a single re-quoted block that length or shorter costs at
 * most that many consecutive checks before the match ends, documented
 * precisely on {@link REQUIRED_CONSECUTIVE_HITS}.
