// The footnote integrity signal, kept beside `downgradeCount` because the two
// answer the same question about different damage.
//
// A repair that breaks a footnote leaves the grammar perfectly valid, so the
// downgrade signal cannot see it. Measured over 56 settled entries, four
// shipped with footnote damage the pipeline had already detected and never
// consulted: a definition invented, a definition duplicated, a reference and a
// definition dropped from different footnotes, and a reference invented in a
// document that carried no footnotes at all.
//
// Counted rather than compared in detail, because the gate asks only whether a
// patch made things WORSE. An input translation is free to arrive with dangling
// references, and one does; that is a defect to repair, not a reason to refuse
// every repair of the chunk holding it.
