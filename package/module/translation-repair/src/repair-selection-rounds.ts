//region Repair selection rounds
// Projects the repair lane's recorded rounds into the shape
// `producer-standing.ts` counts, so an EDITOR can be ranked by the same
// instrument that ranks a writer.
//
// `#200` was opened believing this needed either a schema change or a replay
// path, because a settled artifact exposes neither the envelopes nor the
// issues an editor worked from. Reading the contracts says otherwise:
// `ChunkRepairOutcome.rounds` already carries, per round, the slate judges saw
// with each candidate's producer attached, and every ballot cast over it. That
// is exactly `SelectionRound`, one re-shape away, and both types name the same
// `CandidateProducer` and `SelectionBallot` out of `candidate-select-model.ts`.
//
// SO THE CALIBRATION DRIVES THE LANE LIVE AND READS ITS ROUNDS. Nothing is
// replayed, nothing is stored, and no artifact field changes.
//
// A DECLINED ROUND COUNTS. Judges saw that slate and cast those ballots, and a
// standing counts votes rather than wins: dropping the rounds that failed to
// resolve would keep only the slates judges found easy, and would flatter
// whichever model happened to write in them. A judge that named nothing is
// recorded as `CANDIDATE_NONE`, so it lands in the denominator and gives no
// one a vote, which is the honest reading of an abstention.
//
// STAGES ARE SEPARATED, because they are different jobs. The envelope and
// chunk-patch rounds are the editor's; the refine rounds belong to the
// naturalness lane. Seating one on the other's evidence is the mistake this
// file exists to make impossible.
