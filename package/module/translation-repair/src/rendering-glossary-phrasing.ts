// CLASS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-NINE (shi_Yumiaoya30, 2026-09-25): 摆烂 shipped as
// "turned to one of giving up" and 万千世界 as "this myriad world". lxy writes
// 偶尔摆烂 for taking it easy. Kept beside `rendering-glossary.ts`, which
// spreads these entries into `RENDERING_GLOSSARY`, so neither file outgrows
// the line budget.
//
// THE GLOSSARY AUDIT OF 2026-09-27 took out the entries here that were keyed
// on one sentence's construction rather than on a word (原因是多方面的, 特例,
// 陷入癫狂, 环境的问题, kigurumi的记忆结束); their lessons are the idiomatic
// English, grammatical English and kept-subject rules of
// `english-usage-policy.ts`, on every sheet. 交往 stays as a word but refuses
// nothing, since "dated" is its English wherever the passage speaks of romance.
