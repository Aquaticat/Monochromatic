//region Stage recovery round
// ONE RECOVERY ROUND, OUTSIDE THE QUORUM LOOP AND AFTER IT (`stage-quorum.ts`
// runs it once its quorum rounds are done).
//
// The quorum loop stops the moment quorum stands, which is correct for what
// it is for and is why nothing it re-asks has ever been re-asked: measured
// over 109 rounds of a ten-model roster on 2026-08-25, the first fan-out
// met quorum every time, 1054 voices of 1090 were heard, 31 rounds lost at
// least one, and zero retry rounds ran.
//
// Thirteen of those 36 losses were the model ANSWERING in a shape nothing
// could read, spread over 7 distinct slices of 15 with at most 2 on any
// one, so no input reliably breaks a model. The other 23 were silence,
// which `doc/audit/where-a-round-spends-its-wall-clock.md` measures to be a
// model still thinking. Re-asking both would spend the expensive half to
// recover the cheap half, so only the answered half is re-asked here.
//
// ONE ROUND, NEVER A LADDER. A model that formats badly twice is telling us
// something about itself rather than about the weather, and the calibration
// is what answers that.
//
// ITS OWN MODULE since ledger B109, when counting its log lines' nouns took
// `stage-quorum.ts` past the line budget; the round was already the one
// self-contained step of the gather.

   straggler window: `heardNeeded: 0` leaves
   `runGatherRound` with nothing to wait for, which opens the grace window
   at once and abandons whatever has not arrived when it closes. Asking

   gather for a full exchange deadline, which is six minutes in a run and
   the opposite of what a recovery is for.

   prompt, and each group's prompt names what happened to it; both open
   their windows at once, so the pair costs one window, not two.

   A voice that comes back promptly is still collected: the window
