/**
 Tests for reading a lane producer back out of an artifact (class forty,
 2026-09-17).

 A consolidation slate may carry a lane text as a candidate, and a settled
 artifact records who produced each candidate; the reader must give the
 lane back as it was written and refuse a lane name the contest never had.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
