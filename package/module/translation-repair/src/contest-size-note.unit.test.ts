/**
 * Tests for the size evidence a contest judge is shown, and for the policy that
 * teaches how to read it.
 *
 * WHY THE FAR-LONGER DIRECTION IS TESTED FOR EVIDENCE RATHER THAN FOR A FAULT.
 * `CONTEST_POLICY` tells judges that keeping page-only content is correct where
 * the Chinese is silent, so a candidate preserving a long page-only region is
 * far longer than its original AND is the right candidate. A test asserting a
 * fault there would be pinning the wrong behaviour in place.
 *
 * WHY A BLOCK GAP IS TESTED FOR SILENCE. That reason describes the PAIRING
 * rather than the rendering, and it was the sole cause for 20 of 36 flagged
 * slices on the corpus. Showing a judge a ratio the pairing does not support
 * would be showing it noise, so the exclusion is load-bearing rather than
 * incidental.
 *
 * Fixtures are invented cat text sized to exact character counts, not corpus
 * passages.
