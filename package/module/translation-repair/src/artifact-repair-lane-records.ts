//region Repair lane records
// Where the repair lane's own records live, said once, for every reader that
// wants them.
//
// THE PATH MOVED AND NOTHING NOTICED. Every reader of these records keyed on a
// top-level `artifact.issues` and `artifact.findings` that version 1 wrote and
// version 2 does not. The records did not go away. Across the 47 settled
// artifacts they sit at `lanes.repair.result`: 1546 issue records, 827 of them
// carrying a `shipped` disposition, and 2809 findings. At the keys the readers
// used there are none of either.
//
// What made the move invisible is that the readers walked RAW parsed JSON, so
// a wrong key was never a type error, only an `undefined`. One reader answered
// that `undefined` with an empty list and reported zero shipped records over a
// whole corpus, which reads exactly like a run that shipped nothing. Another
// refused, which at least said something was wrong. Neither could say the KEY
// was wrong.
//
// The findings case is the sharper one: that list exists, by its own reader's
// comment, to notice a stage going quiet. It has reported every stage quiet on
// every artifact since the path moved.
//
// The cure is not a corrected string. It is going through the version 2 parser,
// so the walk to the lane is type-checked and a later move breaks the build
// instead of returning a confident zero.

/**
 * Reads the repair lane's records out of one settled artifact.
 *
 * VERSION 2 OWNS THE ENVELOPE AND THE LANE OWNS ITS CONTENTS, which is why this
 * is split across a parse and two guards. `parseSettledArtifactV2` proves the
 * walk as far as the lane's `result` record and hands it back unread, because
 * version 2 deliberately says nothing about what a result holds. The two arrays
 * inside it are the repair lane's own schema, so they are checked here.
 *
 * BOTH LISTS ARE READ IN ONE PARSE. Version 2 recomputes the comparison and
 * checks it against the copy on file, so asking twice pays for that twice and
 * invites the two answers to come from different reads of the same artifact.
 *
 * ABSENCE REFUSES rather than reading as an empty corpus. On every settled
 * artifact both paths hold an array, an empty one included: an entry that files
 * no issue still writes `issues: []`. So a missing array does not mean a quiet
 * run, it means this reader and the writer disagree, and answering that with an
 * empty list is what hid the moved path in the first place.
 *
 * @param value - parsed artifact JSON, unread
 *
 * @param path - dotted path naming this artifact in error messages
 *
 * @returns Both record lists as written, each element still unread
 *
 * @throws {@link ArtifactParseError} when version 2 refuses the artifact, or
 * when the repair lane's result carries either name as something else
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const { issues, } = repairLaneRecordsOf({ value, path: 'Kitten', },);
