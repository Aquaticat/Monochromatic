//region Repair replacements
// The repair lane's answer to "what text goes where", which is the only thing
// assembly needs from it.
//
// Kept out of `splice-slices.ts` so assembly stays lane-neutral: this is where
// the repair lane's notion of a change, an outcome carrying `changed` and
// `repairedText`, becomes the neutral instruction to write text over a span.

/**
 * Turns repair outcomes into the replacements assembly applies.
 *
 * Outcomes that changed nothing are dropped rather than passed with their
 * original text: writing a slice back over itself is a no-op that still reads,
 * in every later diff and count, as a slice this lane touched.
 *
 * @param outcomes - per-slice repair outcomes in any order
 *
 * @returns One replacement per changed slice
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const replacements = repairReplacements({ outcomes, },);
 * ```
