/**
 Tests for the resolution checker stage.

 `runCheckerStage` had no test, and it produces `tallies`, which decide
 `resolvedIssueIds`. Those feed candidate selection AND the milestone's
 headline resolution rate, so a defect here does not break a run; it moves the
 number the milestone is judged on.

 The stage's own arithmetic lives in `tallyResolutionChecks`, which is tested
 separately. What is untested here is the wiring: that every heard checker
 becomes exactly one ballot, that a lost voice reduces the count rather than
 silently counting as agreement, and that ballot irregularities reach the
 findings rather than being dropped between the two halves.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention.
