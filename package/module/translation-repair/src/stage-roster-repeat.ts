// A STAGE ROSTER IS A SET OF SEATS, and every stage that gathers voices keys
// what it reads back by model id (the panel's ballots, the checkers' ballots,
// the critics' attributions, the page title bench's rows). A roster that seats
// one model twice would count that model's replies as separate voices toward
// quorum while those readers collapse them into one, so a quorum could be met
// on voices that are one model. The editors and the checkers were refused a
// repeated id where their rosters are composed; the panel, the critics and the
// page title bench never were. `gatherStageVoices` is the one place every
// role's round goes through, so the refusal lives there.
