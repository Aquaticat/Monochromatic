/**
 Guards the package's comments against a backtick written with a backslash
 before it. A comment is Markdown to every reader that renders it (TSDoc in an
 editor's hover, the docs a TSDoc tool builds), and Markdown keeps a backslash
 before a backtick inside a code span or a fenced block as the character it is:
 an example fence written with a backslash before each backtick renders as
 three escaped backticks and no fence, and a template literal written with
 escaped backticks inside an example shows code that does not compile. The
 habit comes from writing a comment's text inside a template literal, where
 the escape is needed.

 To show a backtick inside a code span, the span is delimited by a longer run
 of backticks (``` `` a `b` `` ```); inside a fenced example, the code is
 written as it is. The one form kept is a code span that holds nothing but
 backslashes (`` `\` ``, or `` `\\` `` for the JSON escape of one), where the
 backslashes are the span's text and the backtick after them closes the span.

 WHAT THE SCAN READS. Every comment of every TypeScript file under `src`,
 tests included, as the parser reports them: a backslash followed by a
 backtick is a finding unless the run of backslashes it ends has a backtick
 just before it.

 THE FIXTURE CASE COMES FIRST, so the package-wide case is read against a
 scan shown able to find each form (ledger M21). Fixtures are cat-themed.
