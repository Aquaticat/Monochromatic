/**
 Guards the decision-only seat (owner, 2026-09-18: `typesafe/jev-1.13`
 approved on OpenRouter): a model served by OpenRouter's decisions endpoint
 alone sits on the roster with no chat reach, so no chat catalog, cap or
 bench ever asks it for a completion, and it reaches the select judges only
 through its own list once the judge fidelity probe seats it. Cat-themed
 invention where any text is needed; no corpus content appears here.
