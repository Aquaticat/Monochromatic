/**
 Guards class sixty-six (XingZ615, 2026-09-19): the translate lane's slate
 carried a candidate the deterministic publication rule refused after its
 repair turn (the closing poem's attribution moved out of the quote, three
 blocks against the original's two), the judges chose it over two valid
 renderings, the lane contest flagged the winner "retryable" and moved on,
 and the consolidation withheld it as the standing. A candidate the rule
 refuses cannot ship, so it is withheld from the judges after its turn and
 kept as a finding. Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content
 appears here.
