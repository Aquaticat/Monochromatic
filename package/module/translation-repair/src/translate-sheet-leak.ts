//region Sheet evidence copied into a candidate
// MEASURED ON MIO27 (2026-09-17): of 68 translate slate candidates, four
// carried the writer sheet's own WHAT THE PICTURES HERE SAY block, copied
// under the picture component with the readers' transcript inside, and on
// both slices that had one the judges chose it (three of four on slice 11,
// praising it for "all transcribed text exactly as in the ORIGINAL"). The
// contest chose the poem slice's carrier five of five; the consolidation
// replaced it because it was 10.9 times the original's size, not because
// anyone named the block. A sheet's evidence blocks are shown to a writer and
// are never part of the passage, so a candidate carrying one of their labels
// is not a rendering of the original and never reaches a judge.
//
// LEDGER F-8 AND E7 (2026-09-27). `SHEET_LABELS` had fallen behind the
// sheets: six consolidation-writer and polish headers and the translate
// sheet's REJECTED CANDIDATE N were missing, so a candidate carrying one
// passed. A list kept by hand will fall behind again, so every fenced header
// line (a run of at least `PROMPT_FENCE_MIN` fence characters, a label, and
// another run) is refused whatever its label, unless the original or the page
// carries the same line; the list stays for a head copied without its fence.
