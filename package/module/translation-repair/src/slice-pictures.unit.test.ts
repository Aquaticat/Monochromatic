/**
 * Tests for which pictures one slice is shown, and what a stage is told about
 * a picture nobody could corroborate.
 *
 * WHAT THESE PIN is two claims bolted together. First, that
 * `slicePictureNames` takes one section each way exactly the way
 * `fidelity-window.ts`'s `neighbouringSource` does, including its RangeError
 * contract: an index that is not a position in `slices` must never silently
 * name no pictures, because that reads as a slice that shows none rather than
 * the mistake it is. Second, that `slicePictures` keeps a picture nobody could
 * corroborate out of the rendered prompt entirely and names it in `findings`
 * instead, since a stage handed a hedge it cannot weigh is worse off than one
 * simply not told the picture existed.
 *
 * BOTH READINGS TRAVEL for a picture that was corroborated, labelled by
 * model, which one case here asserts on an exact rendered block: the shorter
 * reading vouches for what it carries and the longer carries more, so a stage
 * shown only one of them loses either the vouching or the content.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
