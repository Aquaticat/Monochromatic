/**
 * Tests for the recurrence watch, asked directly rather than through the
 * runaway watch that composes it.
 *
 * WHAT `stream-runaway-watch.unit.test.ts` ALREADY PROVES, and is not repeated
 * here: that a long-period loop past the length bar ends the stream, that the
 * same loop under the bar finishes, and that a candidate quoted twice back to
 * back finishes, including at the length most prone to a false positive. Those
 * are the detector's headline claims and they are covered.
 *
 * WHAT NOTHING COVERED, found by mutation rather than by reading: the BOUNDED
 * BUFFER. Removing the trim that keeps only the trailing `BUFFER_CHARS` left
 * the whole suite green. That trim is load-bearing twice over. It is what makes
 * the cost of watching a stream that never ends constant, which is the only
 * reason this detector can run on the streams it exists to stop. And it is what
 * decides how far apart two copies of a passage may be before the earlier one
 * stops counting, which is a correctness rule and not an optimisation: a
 * reasoning trace in this pipeline restates whole candidates verbatim, so one
 * quoted near the start and again near the end is ordinary work, and without
 * the trim the early copy stays findable forever and the second quotation reads
 * as a loop.
 *
 * SO THE CENTRAL CASE HERE IS A PAIR OF DISTANT QUOTATIONS. The same passage
 * appears twice, far enough apart that the first has scrolled out, with unique
 * text between and around. It must finish. With the trim removed it does not.
 *
 * THE EMPTY-TEXT EARLY RETURN IS NOT A BRANCH worth a case: without it the
 * counters advance by zero and the buffer gains nothing, so no input can tell
 * the two apart. It is a shortcut, and it is left uncovered on purpose.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
