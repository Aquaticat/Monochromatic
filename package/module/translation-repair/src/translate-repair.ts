// User decision, 2026-08-15. The alternatives were dropping an invalid
// candidate, showing judges everything, and dropping only on reference damage;
// all three were rejected in favour of asking the model that wrote it. What
// comes back is one of three answers, and the interesting one is the third: a
// model can say the finding is a fact about the passage rather than about its
// work, which no filter could ever have collected.

// being defended, so a validator that could drop it would be a validator that

 @param signal - caller abort honored by every exchange

 @param perCallTimeoutMs - deadline per exchange

 @param lineStructured - whether the line-structure rule governs this slice,
