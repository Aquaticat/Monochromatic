//region Twin memo
// In-run memoization of slices asking the same question, safe under overlap.
//
// WHAT THE SEQUENTIAL DRIVERS HAD. Two slices carrying identical text ask one
// question, and since their keys said so each driver memoized what it
// PERSISTED so the second twin reused it: a cold run then settled what a warm
// run resumes. The memo held persisted records only, on purpose: a record the
// driver refused to store (nobody heard, an unfilled passage) was not
// memoized, so the twin asked again, exactly as a warm run would (`#238`).
//
// WHAT OVERLAP ADDS. The twin may arrive while the first is still buying. It
// must neither buy the same question twice nor reuse what will not be stored,
// so the memo holds a PROMISE of the persisted record: a twin waits for it,
// reuses the record if one was stored, and buys its own otherwise. The buyer
// withdraws its entry before resolving to nothing, so a third twin that wakes
// finds either the second's entry to wait on or no entry, and registers.
//
// REGISTERED WITHOUT AN AWAIT BETWEEN LOOKING AND SETTING. Two twins that
// both looked, both found nothing, and both yielded before registering would
// both buy; the lookup loop exits, the buy starts and the entry is set in one
// synchronous run.

 * @param buy - starts this slice's own purchase; called at most once, and only

 *
 * @param persistedOf - reads the persisted record off a purchase, answering
 * `nothing` when the purchase was deliberately not stored

 *
 * @returns Twin's record, or the purchase
 *
 * @throws Whatever `buy` throws; a waiting twin sees nothing stored and buys
 * its own, or throws under the same abort

 * ```ts
 * const asked = await reuseTwinOrBuy({
 *   key,
 *   memo: twins,
 *   buy: async function buyThisSlice() {
