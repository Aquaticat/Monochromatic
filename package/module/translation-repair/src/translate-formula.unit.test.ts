/**
 Guards ledger X22 (2026-09-29): the site compiles every page with
 remark-math, so text between dollar signs is a formula there. A translate
 candidate in XingZ616 wrote a TeX command between dollar signs where the
 original has no formula, and nothing refused it; a pair of dollar amounts in
 one paragraph forms a formula the same way. A candidate forming more
 formulas than the original is refused before any judge reads it; one that
 keeps the original's formula, escapes its dollar signs, or keeps them inside
 a JSX attribute is not.

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
