//region Self-preference
// Whether a producer judging its own work actually favours it, measured rather
// than assumed.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Selection discounts a producer's ballot for its own
// candidate to half. The half was CHOSEN, on consistency with nothing, and
// question 4 was answered knowing that: `doc/decision/translation-repair-
// question-answers.md` records it as a stated preference open to revision by
// exactly this measurement.
//
// THE COMPARISON HAS TO BE PAIRED, and that is the whole design. Counting how
// often a producer votes for its own candidate says nothing on its own: a model
// whose translations are genuinely better would do that without any
// self-preference at all. So each candidate is scored against ITSELF: the
// producer's own vote on one side, and the rate among judges with no stake in
// that same candidate on the other. Same text, same slice, same sheet. What
// remains after subtracting is preference for one's own work rather than
// agreement about its quality.
//
// WHAT IT STILL CANNOT SEE: a producer that writes to its own taste rather than
// to the criteria would show up here as self-preference, and so would a roster
// whose members simply agree with themselves across runs. Neither is
// distinguishable from favouritism by ballots alone.
