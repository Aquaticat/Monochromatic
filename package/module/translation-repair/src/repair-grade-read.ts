//
// Separate from the detection reader because the sheets differ in shape as well
// as in question. Detection puts its answer on the item heading; repair puts it
// on a bullet under one, so a grade has to be associated with the heading above
// it rather than read off the same line.
//
// FENCES ARE TRACKED, and that is the whole reason this cannot be a line
// filter. Repair sheets quote corpus prose and model output inside fenced
// blocks, and `repair-sheet.ts` fences them precisely because such text may
// contain a literal `- repair grade: [Y]` or a `### 99.` heading. The sheet is
// safe to LOOK at because the fence is chosen against the content; the sheet is
// only safe to PARSE if the parser honors that fence. A reader that did not
// would let a quoted line fabricate a human verdict, which is worse than
// dropping one: an invented grade cannot be noticed downstream.
