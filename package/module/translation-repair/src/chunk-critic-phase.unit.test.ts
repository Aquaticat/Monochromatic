/**
 * Tests for the critic phase: the fan-out and the deterministic screen over its
 * non-translation votes, together.
 *
 * This module was extracted from the chunk driver for the file-size budget and
 * never covered. Its two halves are each tested elsewhere; what is untested is
 * the WIRING, and the wiring is the reason the module exists. The comment at
 * its head says so: a vote count that has not been screened is not something
 * any caller may act on, and keeping the two adjacent is what stops a later
 * caller reading `nonTranslationVotes` straight off the critic result and
 * blocking a slice on votes the evidence already contradicted.
 *
 * A block is expensive in one direction only. Blocking a faithful translation
 * discards the whole slice unrepaired; failing to block a genuinely
 * untranslated pair leaves its issues surfaced. So the cases below check that
 * `votesStand` is true only when the threshold is met AND nothing contradicted
 * it.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention.
