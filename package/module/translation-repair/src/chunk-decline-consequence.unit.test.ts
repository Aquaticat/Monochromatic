/**
 Tests that the chunk selection tells its judges what a decline does
 (ledger L14(c)).

 WHY. The shared selection sheet says "the caller keeps text it already
 trusts when you decline", and for the chunk selection that holds only when
 EVERY judge declines. A decline names no candidate and counts as no vote, so
 when the judges who named one reach no decision the round is indecision, and
 the repair that landed the most operations goes on to the checkers
 (`selectChunkPatch`, `pickFallbackCandidate`). Over every artifact, 14 of
 2,476 chunk rounds had declines outnumbering the ballots that named a
 candidate, 10 of them read as indecision, and TianqiChen66621 chunk 17 was
 one (4 declined, 1 named); no round had every judge decline. The judges were
 told a cost of declining that the round did not pay.

 THE RULE ITSELF STAYS: a decline as an abstention that does not count is the
 measured policy for the consolidation gate's `neither`
 (`doc/planning/the-third-rendering.md`), and the fallback repairs because
 the panel ruled its issues real (`editor-candidates.ts`). The sheet now says
 what the round does, and both behaviours it states are pinned here.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention.
