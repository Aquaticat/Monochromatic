/**
 Guards class one hundred nineteen (shi_Yumiaoya19, 2026-09-24): the
 community term 药娘 (and 小药娘, which carries it) shipped in Han where
 two earlier runs wrote "little HRT girl" and "little yaoniang". The owner
 answered on 2026-09-24 that the word is disrespectful, used neutrally by
 only some of the community, and that the neutrality does not carry into
 English: the page says "trans woman" or "trans girl". The glossary seeds
 the term with those renderings, and a candidate that keeps a glossary
 term in Han, or writes a form the entry refuses (the pinyin), is refused
 before any judge reads it. A rendering in English, a term the page itself
 keeps, and a term standing inside an HTML comment are left alone.
 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
