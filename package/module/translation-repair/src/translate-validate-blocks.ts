/**
 Findings for a block skeleton that does not carry the floor's.
 
 THE PAGE IS A FLOOR, NOT A CEILING, and two references are why. Measured over
 68 settled slice records, the archive and the Chinese carry the same block
 sequence at 48, the archive carries more at 11 and fewer at 7, and those
 seven are two different things: an archive that MERGED Chinese paragraphs
 into a better shape, and an archive simply MISSING blocks the Chinese
 carries. Anchoring to either alone breaks the other case, so a candidate has
 to carry the floor's blocks and may add one only where the Chinese has more.
 
 WITH THE ORIGINAL AS THE FLOOR THIS IS TODAY'S EXACT MATCH. A floor of the
 original with a ceiling of the original's own length admits one sequence, the
 original's.
 EITHER RENDERING, the owner's decision of 2026-09-07
 (`doc/decision/translation-repair-block-floor.md`): a candidate shaped
 exactly as the original is a faithful rendering of it whatever shape the
 archive chose, so it passes beside one shaped as the page. The Huasheng poem
 is two `<br/>` paragraphs in the source and five paragraphs in the archive,
 every producer followed the source, and the entry stopped with nothing
 valid; 34 of the 92 archives carry more top-level blocks than their source.
 What stays refused is a shape that is neither reference's, which is what a
 dropped passage looks like. THE ORIGINAL'S SHAPE COUNTS ONLY WHERE THE PAGE'S
 SURPLUS IS MORE BLOCKS OF THE ORIGINAL'S OWN KINDS, a split: a page whose
 extra blocks are of a kind the original lacks (the sixth consolidation bed's
 html and blockquote against one paragraph, an archive's blockquote that says
 a passage was left by someone) is carrying something a split cannot explain,
 and a candidate shaped as the original would drop it.
 
 THE PAGE'S SUBSTITUTE AND THE ORIGINAL'S OWN KIND (class thirty-two,
 2026-09-16): Mio's archive ends with a farewell paragraph where the original
 ends with a poem in a block quote, the pairing set the two against each
 other, and a ceiling of max(page, original) left room for one block. The
 consolidation sheet asks a producer to add a block to carry what the
 original has and the archive left out, and the quote is exactly that, so
 the ceiling also admits the page's blocks plus every original block of a
 kind the page has no block of. What the page rendered in a kind of its own
 is kept; what it has no block of the kind for may follow.
 
 @param floor - blocks the candidate has to carry, the page's where there is
 one and the original's where there is not
 
 @param floorName - what a finding calls that sequence
 
 @param source - original's blocks, which set the ceiling with the floor
 
 @param candidate - candidate's blocks
 
 @returns One finding per rule the candidate's shape breaks

 const findings = compareBlocks({ floor, floorName, source, candidate, },);
