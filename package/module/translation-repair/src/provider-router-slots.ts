//region Provider router slots
// HOW MANY CALLS ARE IN FLIGHT PER MODEL ON EACH PROVIDER THAT LIMITS THEM.
//
// COUNTED HERE RATHER THAN ASKED OF THE CLIENT, because saturation is what
// the routing policy calls the state of every slot being busy, and the client
// that owns those slots does not expose their occupancy. The router is the
// layer that dispatches, so it is the one that knows.
//
// ONLY A PROVIDER WITH A PER-MODEL LIMIT IS EVER SATURATED. Synthetic grants
// five concurrent calls per model (`SYNTHETIC_PER_MODEL_CONCURRENCY`); Charm
// Hyper has no such ceiling by owner confirmation, and OpenRouter routes each
// call to one of many upstreams and states none. A provider without a limit
// takes no slot and always reads as having room.
//
// SPLIT FROM `provider-router.ts` at its line budget, along the seam the
// saturation race of 2026-08-24 made visible: the count must move in the same
// synchronous step as the routing decision, so the ledger is a synchronous
// object the router reads and writes with nothing awaited in between.
