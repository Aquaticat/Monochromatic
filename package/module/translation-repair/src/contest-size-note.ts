//region Contest size note
// Size evidence handed to a contest judge when one rendering of a passage is
// far out of proportion to the Chinese it renders.
//
// EVIDENCE, NOT A FAULT NAME, and that distinction is the whole design. A named
// fault in the FAR LONGER direction would contradict `CONTEST_POLICY` itself,
// which already tells judges that where the Chinese is silent rather than
// contradicting, keeping page apparatus or a whole page region the archive
// carries is CORRECT. A candidate preserving a
// long page-only region is far longer than the Chinese AND is the right
// candidate, so a name there would instruct a judge to penalise exactly the
// behaviour that rule protects. That is the shape of a criterion once
// removed: one that licenses the wrong outcome.
//
// MEASURED BEFORE IT WAS BUILT, over all 11 settled artifacts, 184 rows and 116
// eligible after the floor. No slice any lane actually PRODUCED trips a tail:
// 0 of 92, with produced ratios reaching 9.27 against a 10 endpoint and the
// translate lane never passing 4.59. Every trip is a slice where a lane handed
// back the archive unchanged. Both far-longer trips proved to be page-only
// content rather than displacement, established by profiling the whole document
// and finding NO DONOR SLICE: on `dogesir_` slice 3 the archive runs 15.49
// times its Chinese while every other slice runs 0.88 to 6.10 against a
// document of 2.75, so no other slice is starved of the text this one holds.
//
// THE FLOOR IS ONE-DIRECTIONAL, and it did not start that way. A single
// source-length floor guarded both directions until a census over every
// settled artifact showed it inverting the instrument: 40 far-longer
// candidates exist, the note reported 3, and the floor silenced 37. The three
// it reported ran 15.5, 15.5 and 10.1; among those it hid were 185.4, 137.0,
// 100.8, 99.1 and 94.5. The largest, a translate candidate of 10381 characters
// against a 56-character original, is a lane looping rather than a rendering,
// and the judges deciding that passage were told nothing about it.
//
// WHY NO DOCUMENT BASELINE IS THREADED HERE. `PLAUSIBLE_BASELINE_MIN` of 1.9
// and `PLAUSIBLE_BASELINE_MAX` of 4.5 sit strictly inside the 0.8 and 10
// endpoints, so a slice tripping an absolute tail is already outside every
// document norm the estimator will accept. Reading the document's own baseline
// could not change whether the note appears, and threading it would put
// document state through two wire builders for nothing.
//
// WHY NO VERSE MARKER IS THREADED EITHER. A fault name would have needed one,
// because a line-structured original expands unusually and a judge told
// "this is a fault" has no way to discount it. Evidence needs no such guard:
// the policy states outright that a large ratio can be innocent and names verse
// as one reason. Revisit if judges are measured misreading verse ratios.

/**
 Reasons a short original cannot support, because over a twenty-character
 line the ratio reports rounding rather than a rendering.
 
 ONLY THE SHORTER DIRECTION, and the asymmetry is the whole point. A
 20-character original against a 12-character rendering is noise, and reading
 it as a shortfall would fire the note on every short line in the corpus. A
 56-character original against a 10381-character rendering is not rounding in
 either direction: it is a runaway, and it is exactly what this note exists
 to put in front of a judge.

 RATIO TAILS ONLY, read off character counts. A block-count gap says the two
 sides may not be the same passage, which makes a ratio meaningless rather
 than extreme, and it was the sole cause for 20 of 36 flagged slices while
 being the thing a re-pairing moves; showing a judge a ratio the pairing does
 not support would be showing it noise. Reading no blocks also means parsing
 no rendering, so a rendering the slice grammar refuses still gets its note
 (ledger B68).

 knows the note is about this passage rather than boilerplate it can skim. On
 the settled corpus that is 2 of 116 eligible rows.
 
 A SHORTFALL against an original shorter than {@link MIN_RATIO_SOURCE_CHARS}
 is passed over, because a ratio over a twenty-character line reports
 rounding. A SURPLUS is reported at any original length, and
 {@link FLOORED_REASONS} carries the measurement behind that split.
 
 A rendering of zero length raises nothing here, because
 {@link ratioImplausibility} reports no reason when either side is empty. An
 empty candidate is a different failure, and the stage guards name it.
