/**
 Refuses a body whose event stream did not end the way a whole message does:
 with a `message_stop` frame, and with no error event anywhere in it.

 SPLIT OUT SO THE RETRY LADDER CAN ASK IT TOO. A body that stops before
 `message_stop` is a transport failure wearing a success status: the HTTP
 exchange returned 200 and the message inside it is not whole. Reading it
 only after the retry had already returned meant the one failure this file
 calls a transport failure was the only one that never retried.

 ONE RULE IN ONE PLACE. `extractAnthropicCompletion` calls this rather than
 carrying its own copy, so the retry and the parse can never disagree about
 what a finished message looks like.

 THE TERMINATOR IS A FRAME OF THAT TYPE, read off the parse (ledger B87).
 Looking for the quoted word anywhere in a payload passed a body cut inside
 its last frame, after `{"type":"message_stop"` and before the closing
 brace, so the ladder returned it and the fold then refused it as not JSON,
 with no retry left to spend. It also passed any frame holding that word as
 a value, a tool's name for one.

 AN ERROR EVENT REFUSES THE MESSAGE even when a terminator follows it, and
 the refusal names its type. The provider said why it stopped; calling that
 a cut connection sent a reader to the network. Refused here, it is retried
 like a cut stream, which suits an overloaded or internal error. An error
 event naming a request the provider refuses (`REFUSED_REQUEST_STATUS`) is
 a {@link StreamErrorEventError} instead, carrying the status the same
 refusal has over plain HTTP, which the retry ladder does not retry.

 ONLY THE ENDING IS READ. A frame elsewhere in the body that does not parse
 is the fold's to refuse, after the ladder: a body whose terminator arrived
 was delivered whole, and a frame inside it that cannot be read is read here
 as a formatting defect a retry would repeat and pay for again (an
 inference, not measured). `requireStreamTerminator`, the OpenAI-shaped
 sibling, reads the same scope.

 @param bodyText - whole drained body, as the transport returned it

 @throws {@link StreamErrorEventError} when an error event names a request the provider refuses
