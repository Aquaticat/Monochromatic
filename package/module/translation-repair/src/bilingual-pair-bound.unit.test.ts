/**
 Guards the second arm of class eighty (2026-09-22). The
 sheet clause of `bilingual-line-clause.ts` reached every wording and the
 judges still chose the candidate that rendered the film quote's Chinese line
 a second time in English, calling the candidate carrying the English alone
 "a dropped line ... ineligible" under the line criterion, and one judge
 reasoning that the Chinese line "is a literal translation of the sentiment,
 which is distinct from the actual English quote". A judge without the film
 cannot see that the two lines are one, so the question is settled where the
 evidence is: the EXISTING TRANSLATION, a human's, carried the pair as one
 line, and a rendering carrying more lines than that on a slice with such a
 pair has invented one. Without page text, or where the page itself keeps the
 two lines apart (an introduction then a quoted poem, on ten other entries),
 nothing is refused and the judges decide.

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
