// ONE TARGET NAMED BY TWO SOURCES that no voice named together. The first
// `noname` pass of 2026-09-09 paired the original's `## 简介` heading with the
// archive's opening paragraph and dropped the paragraph-to-paragraph pair as
// "non-monotone", because agreement walked the sources in order and the later
// source's claim on the same target could only be a merge or a run-back. The
// heading then had no slice of its own, the paragraph became an insertion the
// page already carried, and the page shipped without the heading 84 of 86
// archives carry.
//
// A target two sources claim without corroboration is a CONTEST, the mirror of
// one source named against two targets, and `bestVoted` already decides that
// one by votes. So does this: the better-voted claim keeps the target, a tie
// keeps neither, and the finding says which.
