// an injected function.
//
// The runaway guards, the idle and straggler windows and the answer-volume
// bound all read a `DeltaScanner`, and every threshold in them was measured.
// Two providers speak two grammars, and letting a caller pass any scanner would
// make it possible to drain a stream with a reader that does not understand it,
// which fails silently: the guards would see an empty answer channel and a
// perfectly well-behaved call.
//
// A NAMED FORMAT INSTEAD, so the set of readable grammars is the set of
// grammars somebody wrote a reader for.
