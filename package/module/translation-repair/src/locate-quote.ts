//region Quote location
// Deterministic evidence anchoring: find a critic's quote in the document,
// reject absence and ambiguity, and bind the located region to block nodes.
// Block-crossing regions split into one span per touched block, because models
// quote across paragraph boundaries no matter what the prompt demands.
//
// ONE SEARCH OVER THE BROADEST ACCEPTED FORM, rather than a chain of passes
// from strict to loose. Both normalizations replace one UTF-16 unit with one,
// so offsets found in the normalized text index the stored document unchanged.
//
// WHY IT IS NOT A CHAIN, which is what it was until a review found the hole.
// Each pass used to check ambiguity WITHIN ITS OWN CLASS and return on its
// first hit, so a document holding `bad\nword` early and `bad word` late
// answered the quote `bad word` with the late one: unique among byte-exact
// matches, and the earlier occurrence just as valid under the wrapping rule the
// next pass would have applied. Whitespace and punctuation in a model's quote
// are not evidence of WHICH occurrence it meant, since a model normalizes both
// when it copies, so uniqueness has to be judged over every form treated as
// equal. Measured before changing it, over three corpus passes and 16,479
// anchored quotes checked against the slice each was anchored in: NOT ONE would
// be refused by the stricter rule. The same count against whole pages, which is
// the wrong scope but proves the probe can see ambiguity, reports 566.
