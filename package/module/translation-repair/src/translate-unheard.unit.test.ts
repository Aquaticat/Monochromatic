/**
 * Tests for what a settled record means when no translator was heard.

 * WHAT THESE PIN is a property three other places already rest on: the driver
 * refusing to cache such a slice, the wording builder reporting it as the
 * archive standing by default, and the artifact reader that will read both. All
 * three assume the record left the archive alone, and nothing checked it.
 *
 * A stage that heard nobody and returned a change would travel: the lane's
 * shipped set is built from `changed`, so the document would carry a
 * replacement while the wording ledger reported that nobody produced one.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
