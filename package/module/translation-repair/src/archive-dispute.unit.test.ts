/**
 Guards class one hundred seven (owner answer 2026-09-24, "Not eligible;
 fall back to the repair text"): CuspariaKLSY10 slice 3's archive rendering
 named a suicide method the original never states, the repair lane's
 adjudicators accepted the `accuracy/addition` claims against it and removed
 the detail, the translate slate backed nobody, and the archive stood because
 an eligible standing keeps its single round. The reading here names such a
 slice a dispute and hands the repair lane's text over as the archive's
 stand-in. Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
