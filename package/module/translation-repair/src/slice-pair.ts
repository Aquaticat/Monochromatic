/**
 Subdivides one aligned section pair into paragraph-bound slice pairs.
 A section whose target is an insertion is sliced by the source alone, one
 slice per budget run, all written at the insertion boundary. Every other
 pair carries blocks on both sides, and a monotone alignment decides which
 block partners which, and may leave a block unpartnered rather than force it
 onto a neighbour. Pairing by shared index was tried and is wrong: equal node
 counts do NOT imply one-to-one correspondence, so a translation that drops
 one block and gains another elsewhere kept its total while every pairing
 after the drop compared a block against its neighbour. Paragraph-count
 mismatch within a section is ordinary translation freedom, so subdivision
 emits no findings.
 
 @param pair - aligned section pair to subdivide
 
 @param sourceText - whole original document text for slice extraction
 
 @param targetText - whole translation document text for slice extraction
 
 @param baseIndex - global slice index of this pair's first slice
 
 @param budget - target-side characters one slice aims for;
 defaults to {@link SLICE_CHAR_BUDGET}
 
 @param blockPairing - correspondences a roster agreed on, chunk-local; absent
 when the roster agreed none, so the scorer pairs the blocks
 
 @param sealed - ids of translation blocks the archive's note seals, which
 reach no slice and take the originals paired to them along
 
 @returns Slice pairs covering both sides of the section completely but for
 the sealed blocks, beside the ids of the originals sealed with them
 
 @example
 ```ts
 const { slices, sealedSourceIds, } = subdivideSealedChunkPair({
   pair,
   sourceText,

   the larger the translation call, which is exactly backwards for a lane
   that exists to translate what nobody translated.
