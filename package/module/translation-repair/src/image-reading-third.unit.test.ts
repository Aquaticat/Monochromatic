/**
 Guards class fifty-two (XingZ601, 2026-09-17): a picture read by three
 readers is corroborated when ANY two of them agree, not only when the first
 two do. The corroboration compared only the first two readings, a rule
 written when the vision sub-roster was exactly two models; on a bench of
 five, a score screenshot read by three models stopped the entry at overlap
 0.297 between the two it compared while the third reading agreed with both
 of them (0.586 and 0.326). Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus
 content appears here.
