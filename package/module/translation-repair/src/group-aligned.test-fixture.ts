 Test-only grouping of an aligned block pair with nothing sealed, through
 the grouper the slicing calls (ledger B30). A wrapper doing this shipped as
 package source, and the tests called it while production always passes the
 archive's seals to `groupNodesSealed`; the tests now read that function.

 Runs `groupNodesSealed` makes of an aligned pair when the archive's note
 seals nothing.

 @param sourceNodes - original blocks in document order

 @param targetNodes - translation blocks in document order

 @param sourceBudget - original-side character budget per slice

 @param targetBudget - translation-side character budget per slice

 @param steps - roster's pairing as steps, when the case has one

 @returns Runs covering every block on both sides exactly once

 @throws {@link Error} when the grouper reports an original sealed away
