 Places blocks held from one-sided runs, never emitting a run with an empty
 side and never dropping one.

 TWO SIDES MAKE A SLICE AND ONE SIDE FOLDS. Held blocks on both sides are a
 reviewable slice of their own. A single side is not: `runToChunk` builds a
 span from a run's first and last node, so a run with an empty side has no
 span and throws. Dropping it instead is the opposite failure, and it defeats
 `declinedTargetIds` refusing to decline a block precisely so it stays in
 review.

 THE TWO SIDES FOLD DIFFERENTLY, because an insertion run carries originals
 and a translation OFFSET rather than translation blocks. Held translations
 may fold back past an insertion, which contributes none of them. Held
 originals may not: that insertion's own originals sit between, so reaching
 past them would report the two groups out of document order. They join the
 insertion instead, which is where the nearest place for a rendering is.

 NEITHER SIDE FOLDS PAST A SEAL. A held translation looks for a host after
 the last sealed run, since folding it backwards would stretch a span over
 the sealed bytes; held originals behind a sealed run become an insertion
 written at the seal's end, which is the page shape a footnote definition
 after a sealed letter needs.

/**
 Folds runs that ended up with nothing on one side into a neighbour, EXCEPT
 the ones holding originals nothing rendered, and EXCEPT across a seal.

 A run of purely unpartnered TRANSLATION blocks has no original to compare
 against and nothing to write, so it joins the run beside it rather than
 becoming a slice nobody can review. It merges backwards when a previous run
 exists and forwards otherwise, which keeps a leading run of skips attached to
 the first reviewable slice.

 A run of unplaced ORIGINALS is the opposite case, and block-scale insertion
 stops folding it. Those blocks have something to write and nowhere yet to write it;
 folding them into a neighbour puts them inside that slice's span, where no
 later stage can tell them apart from the passage they were folded into.

 A SEALED RUN stands where it is: nothing folds into it and it folds into
 nothing, and the runs either side of it never meet.

 @param runs - runs as grouped, possibly one-sided

 @returns Runs that all carry blocks on both sides, sealed runs among them,

 reported rather than dropped: the caller keeps their bytes as the archive
 has them, as it does for text outside the alignment

  // blocks, no paired run after the last seal), the blocks stay held. Held
  // originals are then left out of the runs, saying nothing. A section one side
  // of which has no blocks is that case (`group-aligned.unit.test.ts` pins it),
  // and `subdivideSealedChunkPair` never groups one: an empty translation side
  // is an insertion it slices by the original, and every aligned chunk holds a
  // block. NO CALLER FALLS BACK ANY MORE: the one-slice fallback
  // `subdivideSealedChunkPair` kept for such a section went in T8's
  // seventeenth batch (its own comment says so). A caller of
  // `subdivideChunkPair` alone has no coverage check for the originals.
  //
  // A HELD TRANSLATION BLOCK THAT REMAINS IS REPORTED, NEVER DROPPED. An archive
  // block ahead of a sealing note with no paired run before it has nothing to
  // join: the sealed run takes nothing in, and every block after the note is
  // sealed with it, so none follows to take it either. This used to throw
  // `UnplacedTranslationBlocksError`, which stopped the whole page where the
  // archive's own bytes could be kept. A bounded probe over generated archive
  // pages (a span note at a random place, scorer and supplied walks) reached it
  // for 115 of 3000 sections. The caller now carries the ids the way text
  // outside the alignment is carried (`preparation-unclaimed.ts`): in no slice,
  // byte for byte as the archive has them, and handed to the block correction
