 Guards class forty-nine (shi_Yumiaoya3, 2026-09-17): a candidate that
 defines a footnote the original passage only refers to is refused before
 any judge reads it, since the definition lives in another slice and a
 second one makes the assembly withdraw both carriers. Cat-themed invention
 throughout; no corpus content appears here.
