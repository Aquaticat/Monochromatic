//region Container unwrapping
// Corpus pages wrap material in disclosure elements: an `en` page collapses a
// whole trailing gallery into one `<details>`, while its `zh` counterpart
// carries the same blocks at top level. Because chunking and alignment walk
// TOP-LEVEL blocks only, that page counted 17 blocks against the original's 25,
// alignment degraded to proportional merging, and critics were handed
// non-corresponding material. The graded milestone-three sample scored the
// result as omissions of content that was present all along, merely nested.
//
// Flattening promotes a container's block children to peers so both sides
// expose comparable structure. Offsets are untouched: a promoted child keeps
// its own absolute span, and the container's opening and closing tags fall
// outside every promoted span.
//
// THOSE TAGS THEN BELONG TO NO BLOCK, which is why this walk also reports them.
// Surviving as inter-block text is safe only while both tags sit on the same
// side of every slice boundary. `Zha_Ke` showed what happens otherwise: a slice
// range held the `<details>` opener and stopped eleven characters before its
// closer, so assembly replaced the opener away and copied the closer through,
// losing 3708 characters of will and leaving markup that closes nothing. No
// invariant could see it, because all of them reason over blocks and a tag in
// no block is not one. `#154` has the measurements.
//
// Thirty of the pinned corpus's pages carry a disclosure element, so this is
// ordinary structure rather than one document's quirk.
