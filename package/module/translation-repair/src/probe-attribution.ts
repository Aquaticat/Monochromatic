//region Probe attribution
// The shape a probe reading has once it has been READ BACK from an artifact,
// which is deliberately smaller than the shape that was written.
//
// A screened claim carries who said it, what the deterministic check made of
// it, and the wording it quoted. The quotes are UNLICENSED corpus text. The
// reader that feeds `score-probe` exists to produce counts that are safe to
// paste into a verdict or a message, so it parses attribution and drops every
// quote field.
//
// Before these types existed the reader satisfied `ScreenedDefectClaim` by
// filling `evidence`, `omittedText`, `reason`, `category` and `severity` with
// the empty string. That is a claim shaped exactly like a complete one, and
// nothing in the type said otherwise: a caller reading `claim.evidence` got
// `''` and had no way to tell "this reader does not parse quotes" from "the
// prober quoted nothing". The first reading is always right and the second is
// impossible, since the screen cannot admit a claim with no anchor as
// corroborated.
//
// So the reduced shape is named instead of faked. A full claim remains
// assignable to the reduced one, which is what lets the same telemetry
// functions summarize readings straight from the pipeline and readings lifted
// off disk.
