//region Translate alignment guard
// Whether a slice's pairing is trustworthy enough to REPLACE the archive text.
//
// The lane translates a source slice and lets judges compare the result against
// the translation already there. That question is only meaningful if the two
// sides are the same passage. When the aligner pairs a heading against a whole
// section, the judges are asked which of two unrelated texts is the better
// rendering of the heading, and they answer correctly: the rendering of the
// heading. The archive section is then replaced by a sentence.
//
// MEASURED, not supposed. On the roster bench, slice `windward0032#10` paired a
// 3-character source, "其一：", against a 226-character English passage, and the
// lane replaced the passage at every roster width tried.
//
// This guard runs AFTER the stage, never before it: the lane must translate
// every slice unconditionally, and what the judges decided is evidence worth
// recording even when the decision is refused.
