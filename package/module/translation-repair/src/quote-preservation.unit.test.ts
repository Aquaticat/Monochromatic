/**
 Tests for the guard that stops an edit deleting a quoted passage.

 WHY THIS QUESTION AND NOT THE OTHER ONE. The harm is that a lane writing from
 the source alone deletes English the source cannot account for, and the
 obvious response is to work out which passages those are. That is not cheaply
 decidable: translation changes bytes by construction, so no exact match
 separates an unpaired passage from an ordinary translated one. Deletion, on
 the other hand, is decidable from the two texts alone, and measured over both
 settled pools it caught four real losses and nothing else in sixty-nine
 natural rows.

 THE COUNT IS THE PARSER'S (ledger B42). It was the number of
 blank-line-separated chunks opening with `>`, which refused a replacement
 keeping every quote where a quote opened on the line after a paragraph's,
 and saw no quote inside a container tag. The cases for both read the counts
 the old splitter got wrong.

 THE CARRIAGE-RETURN CASE IS NOT DEFENSIVENESS. One of the 184 markdown files
 in the pinned corpus uses CRLF throughout. A splitter looking for two bytes
 `\n\n` finds no boundary there and reads the whole document as one block.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
