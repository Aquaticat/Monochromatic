// WHETHER TWO MODELS READ THE SAME PICTURE, which is the only check on a
// reading that neither script nor subject matter can starve.
//
// WHAT THIS REPLACED. The screen used to compare a reading against the
// transcript the archive already carried, requiring two shared anchors. Real
// traffic on 2026-08-19 refused every reading of `Mio/7`'s two pictures, four
// attempts across two assets and two readers, while those same readings agreed
// with EACH OTHER at 0.967 and 1.000 character overlap. The clause assumed a
// slice's target-only English transcribes that slice's pictures, and where it is
// some other kind of addition every correct reading there fails.
//
// IT WAS ALSO STRUCTURALLY STARVED. A reading comes back in the picture's own
// language and the archive transcript is English, so the only tokens that can be
// shared are names, handles and numbers. Measured overlap was 2, 2, 4, 5, 5, 5
// against a floor of 2: two of six sat exactly on it, and a picture of pure
// Chinese prose could never clear it however correctly it was read.
//
// TRIGRAMS RATHER THAN ANCHORS OR CHARACTERS. Anchors are Latin words, digit
// runs and handles, so two readings of a Chinese picture carry none. Single
// characters fail the other way: two unrelated English texts share most of the
// alphabet, so single-character overlap runs near one on a wrong pair. Trigrams
// are starved by neither, which is why the threshold below is stated over them.
//
// MEASURED, WITH ITS CONTROL. Over five pictures each read by both models, and
// every cross-pair as the control:
//
//   same picture, different models      5 pairs   0.643 to 1.000
//   different pictures                 40 pairs   0.000 to 0.129
//
// The threshold sits between them with about a factor of two of margin each way.
// Full evidence in `doc/audit/reading-a-picture-at-the-user-boundary.md`; the
// stated rule is `doc/planning/when-an-image-reading-makes-no-sense.md`.
//
// NO REGEX, per `RG1`: collapsing whitespace and cutting trigrams are both
// single linear passes, which a scan states more plainly than a pattern does.
