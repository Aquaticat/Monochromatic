//region Container extents
// A block's extent used to be its mdast position and nothing else, and that is
// the whole of `#154`: a container's opening and closing tags belong to no
// node, so every range minted from a first node's start and a last node's end
// drew its boundary straight through them. TWO independent sites mint such
// ranges, section chunking in `chunk-document.ts` and slice carving in
// `slice-pair.ts`, and a repair at either one leaves the other cutting tags.
// Measured on the corpus: eight refused entries are cut by the slice site and
// three (`SevenBird`, `mikaela_khara`, `XingZ60`) by the chunk site, whose
// closing tag lands in the gap between two chunks.
//
// So the correction lands where the package first writes an extent rather than
// at either consumer. A block carrying a container's opening tag OWNS that
// tag, and a block carrying its closing tag owns that one. Every consumer
// reading a start and an end inherits the correction without ever learning
// that containers exist.
//
// This also DISSOLVES the atomicity requirement rather than implementing it.
// When a container's blocks fall in different slices, the first slice carries
// the opening tag inside its own text and the last carries the closing tag
// inside its own, so each tag is wholly held by some slice and neither is half
// held. Keeping a container's blocks together stops being necessary.
//
// Safe because it was measured first, not because it reads safe: across both
// sides of the whole corpus there are 53 containers and not one whose tag
// region overlaps any block node, so widening cannot reach a neighbour's text.
