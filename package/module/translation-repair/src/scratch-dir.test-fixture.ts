/**
 Throwaway directories for tests that write files, removed when their scope
 ends.

 ONE COPY. Test files that kept their own copy of this helper, under names
 such as `throwawayCacheDir` or `scratchDirectory`, with only the directory
 prefix and the field name on the returned handle differing, now import it
 from here. Helpers that make a directory and never remove it are a different
 behaviour and stay in their files until they gain a disposer of their own.

 `scratchDirWith` is for a helper whose setup runs more than the one call
 that makes the directory: `git init`, a write, a commit, each its own
 `await` the directory must survive a throw from, until the helper's own
 return. Binding `scratchDir`'s result with `await using` inside such a
 helper is wrong, since it disposes before the caller ever sees the
 directory; `scratchDirWith` runs the setup under a `try` instead, so a
 throw partway through still removes the directory before it escapes.
 `scratchDirPrepared` is the same for a setup that hands back no fields of
 its own, so no caller spells an empty result type.

 Makes a fresh directory under the platform temp root, runs `setup` against
 it, and carries `setup`'s own result alongside the directory, removed on
 scope exit; a throw anywhere in `setup` removes the directory before it
 escapes, since nothing outside this function ever held a reference to it
 yet.

 REFUSED AT THE TYPE LEVEL: `setup`'s result may not declare `path` or
 `[Symbol.asyncDispose]` of its own. Both come from the directory this
 function already made, and a `setup` that redeclared either would have its
 own value silently overwritten by one call ordered after the spread; a
 runtime refusal could only catch this once a case actually ran, where a
 compile error catches it at the one place this helper is itself edited.

 @param prefix - start of the directory's name, so a leftover shows which
 test made it

 @param setup - fills the directory, reading only its path, never its
 disposer, so it cannot remove the directory ahead of its own caller; returns
 the fields a caller reads alongside that path
