/**
 Guards the owner's answer of 2026-09-27 ("Adjudicated", seventeenth addendum
 of `doc/decision/translation-repair-ineligible-standing.md`): the
 major-or-worse dispute rule reads the severity the panel settled on the
 issue, not the severity a critic filed on one claim. On XingZ6014 slice 66
 a claim filed major disputed the archive though the panel settled the issue
 minor, and slice 19 went undisputed though the panel settled its issue
 major.

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
