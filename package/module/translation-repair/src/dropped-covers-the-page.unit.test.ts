/**
 * Tests that a judge is told deleting page-only content is a fault.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE EXISTS TO STOP, measured on the sixth consolidation bed. One
 * slice's ORIGINAL is a single parenthetical note; its archive page is that note
 * followed by an entire will. A consolidation rendered the note alone and the
 * gate voted six to nil to ship it, deleting the will from the page.
 *
 * TWO BALLOTS ON THAT SLICE REASONED IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS, and both were
 * correct under the rules they had. One objected that rival candidates add a
 * whole document "not present in the ORIGINAL". Another objected that rival
 * candidates "omit the body of the will". Nothing said which reading governs.
 *
 * THE GAP WAS NARROWER THAN IT LOOKED. The policy already said a detail the
 * archive supplies is not unsupported, so keeping was licensed. But DROPPED was
 * defined purely as omitting something THE CHINESE says, so deleting page-only
 * content was not a fault of any named kind, and its examples were all small: a
 * name, a spelled-out referent. Facing a whole will, a judge did not read them
 * as covering it.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention.
