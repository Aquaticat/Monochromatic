/**
 * Tests for reading one region tally out of a probe artifact.
 *
 * THE COUNTS ARE DERIVED AND THE PARSER SAYS SO. The screen computes every
 * declared count from the claim list, so the two are one fact written twice,
 * and a tally where they disagree is a malformed artifact rather than a
 * different answer. The reader refuses it, because downstream the CLAIMS report
 * sums the counts while the majority rule reads the claims, and a disagreement
 * would make one region report a corroboration and flag nothing.
 *
 * ATTRIBUTION ONLY. A claim carries evidence and reasons quoted from corpus
 * text; the tally this reader returns carries who said it and how the screen
 * judged it, and nothing else, which the control case pins by handing it a
 * claim with those fields and reading back the keys.
 *
 * `readArtifactProbe` was the only caller and reached this through whole probe
 * files, so no case named these refusals before.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
