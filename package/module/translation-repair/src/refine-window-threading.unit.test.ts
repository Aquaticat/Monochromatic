/**
 * Tests that the naturalness PHASE computes `#107`'s neighbouring window and
 * hands it to the damage probe inside each slice's settlement.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS SEPARATE FROM THE SHEET TEST. `introduced-defect-wire` already
 * renders a window it is HANDED, and the accuracy lane already hands it one.
 * Whether the REFINEMENT lane computes one and passes it over is a different
 * question, and it is the one `#68` records going wrong: this lane's probe was
 * called with no window at all for as long as it existed, so the naturalness
 * lane's auditor reasoned about a slice alone while the accuracy lane's auditor
 * reasoned about one in context, and their findings were never comparable.
 *
 * The failure mode is invisible to every other kind of test. The window is an
 * optional property spread into an object literal, TypeScript does not
 * excess-property-check a spread, and the probe decides nothing, so a lane that
 * never passed it compiled, linted, and passed its own suite while asking the
 * models a strictly smaller question.
 *
 * NO NETWORK. The client is a stub scripting the rewriter, the judges, the
 * retention recheck and the probe, and recording every probe sheet.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention mirroring corpus structure only.
