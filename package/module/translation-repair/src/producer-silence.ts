//region Producer silence
// WHO IS MISSING FROM A STANDING TABLE, and which of the reasons it is.
//
// `producerStandings` counts ballots, so it carries a row only for a model that
// wrote a candidate somebody voted on. Every other seated model vanishes, and an
// absent row reads exactly like a model that wrote and lost. Three times that
// has been the wrong reading: a provider out of credit takes half the roster
// off the table; a slate where every producer proposed the same wording ships
// without a ballot being cast over it; and a rewriter that answers every ask
// and leaves the paragraph as it stands never reaches a slate at all, which
// `#263` found reported as provider silence beside a SEAT line saying the seat
// had answered 31 of 31.
//
// THE REASONS CALL FOR DIFFERENT ACTIONS, which is why they are separated
// rather than reported as one absence. A model that answered nothing is
// evidence nobody has bought yet, and re-running those seats buys it. A model
// that answered and was never slated has been paid for and will answer the
// same way again; only slices with something to rewrite would seat it. A model
// that wrote text nobody voted on has already been paid for, and only more
// slices separate it from a model that lost.
//
// WHO ANSWERED IS KNOWN ONLY WHERE THE STAGE CARRIES IT OUT. The refine stage
// does; the editor stage carries only a count out of the chunk outcome. A seat
// that cannot say who answered says so in its line rather than folding the
// unknown into "wrote nothing", because that fold is exactly the misreport.
//
// SEATED ROSTER IN, so this file names no roster of its own. Both calibrations
// pass the seats they filled, and a table describing seats a run never filled is
// refused rather than reported.
