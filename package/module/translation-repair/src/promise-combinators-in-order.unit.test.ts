/**
 Guards the family of defect where an outcome a reader sees is decided by
 which of several concurrent operations happens to end first.

 `Promise.all`, `Promise.race` and `Promise.any` settle on whichever member
 ends first, so where several members can fail with failures a reader tells
 apart, one input printed different refusals on different runs. The package's
 answer is one helper, `allInInputOrder` (`all-in-input-order.ts`), which
 reports the failure of the first failing member in input order. THIS SCAN
 KEEPS THE FAMILY CLOSED: production code calls `Promise.all`,
 `Promise.allSettled`, `Promise.race` and `Promise.any` only where this file
 lists the call, the helper's own one or a site with the reason it is outside
 the family.

 WHAT THE SCAN READS, in package source (not tests and fixtures): the parsed
 program, so a mention in a comment or a string is none. A call it follows is
 one whose callee is a member of the identifier `Promise` named plainly or by
 a string literal, through any wrapper a callee can wear (optional, non-null,
 parentheses), and that name is the combinator called. Every other way it
 sees to reach a combinator is a finding. `Promise` read other than as such a
 callee, a type, `new Promise` or a member that is no combinator: a
 combinator read but not called, `Promise` bound to another name,
 destructured (in a declaration, an assignment or a parameter's default),
 read by a computed key that is no string literal (a variable, a template, an
 expression), cast, or handed on whole. `globalThis` or `global` read other
 than by a named member. A member named `Promise` read off any value, which
 reaches `Promise` off the global object, a chain of its members or a
 namespace import. A member named `constructor` read off any value, which
 reaches `Promise` from any promise. A member named like a combinator read off
 anything but `Promise`, which may be `Promise` reached another way, save
 `AbortSignal.any`, which settles no promise. And any of those names taken by
 destructuring a value other than `Promise` or the global object, whose own
 read is the finding there. A member named plainly that is none of those
 (`Promise.resolve`) reaches no combinator and passes.

 EACH CALL IS KEYED `path#function`, by the function holding it: its own
 name, the name it is bound to (by a declaration, an assignment, a default or
 an object key), or its class and method (`Cat.groom`); `<module>` outside
 any function. A call in a function with no name, or in one whose name
 another function of the same file carries, is a finding, so two sites of
 one file never share a key unsaid. No site is keyed by its line.

 THE LIST IS THIS FILE'S, and each reason was read against the code it
 excuses. The entries of one site excuse its calls of their combinator one
 each, the first entry the first call in source order. A site holding more
 or fewer calls than it has entries is a finding naming every call it holds,
 and none of its entries is checked then, since none can be paired with the
 call it was read against. Each entry names what its reason rests on, and the
 scan holds that to THE CALL IT EXCUSES. `catch` is every catch clause inside
 the call, at least one, each throwing nothing, calling no function named as
 the package names a helper that throws (`assert`, `require`, `rethrow`,
 `throw`), binding its error to a name rather than taking it apart, and
 reading that name only to hand it to a named reader, whole or as an object
 argument's property. A name must stand in the innermost statement making the
 call, or in code that feeds it a variable, directly or through other such
 code: an earlier statement of each block on the way out to the function, or
 the head of a loop whose body holds the call; for a reason resting on how
 settled results are read, also in a later statement of the call's own block
 reading a variable the call's statement declares. A name written as
 `{ inHandler }` must stand in the handler of a `try` whose block holds the
 call, for a reason resting on what that catch does with a rejection. An
 entry whose call no longer holds what it rests on is a finding. The helper's
 own call is listed like any other, counted and resting on nothing the scan
 reads. A tripwire, not a proof: what a named function does is read by hand
 when the entry is written.

 OUT OF THE SCAN'S REACH: `Promise` reached through text the parser does not
 read as code (`eval`, `Function`, a combinator called inside that text);
 through a computed key that is no string literal, or a reflective read
 (`Reflect.get(p, 'constructor')`), off any value but `Promise` and the
 global object, since every such read in the package would otherwise be a
 finding; through an alias another module exports that is handed on or read
 by such a key (one read by a combinator's name is found); combinators of
 other libraries; concurrency that is no `Promise` combinator
 (`mapOverlapped` throws the lowest position's failure by its own
 construction, `p-limit` only bounds); a pair of promises started by hand and
 awaited in turn, which is searched for by reading; a call in a class field's
 initializer or a static block, which is keyed by the function or module
 around the class; and what a function an anchor names actually does.

 THE FIXTURE CASES COME FIRST, so the package-wide case is read against a
 scan shown able to find each form (ledger M21). Fixtures are cat-themed; the
 package case reads this package's own source.
