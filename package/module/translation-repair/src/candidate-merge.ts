// Collapsing candidates that render the same text, keeping every author.
//
// Two things break when identical proposals stand as separate candidates. The
// ballot SPLITS, so text every producer agreed on can lose to a lone dissenter;
// and the pair-based self-vote discount stops applying, because each copy is
// credited to one model and the others look disinterested in it.
//
// The translate lane does this inline while assembling its slate, since it also
// has an incumbent to fold in. This is the plain version for lanes that only
// have model proposals.

/**
 * Merges candidates rendering identical text, crediting every producer.
 *
 * Order is preserved and the FIRST copy holds the position, so a lane that
 * assembles candidates in roster order keeps that order.
 *
 * @param candidates - proposals as their producers made them
 *
 * @returns Distinct proposals, each carrying every model that wrote it
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const distinct = mergeIdenticalCandidates({ candidates, },);
 * ```
