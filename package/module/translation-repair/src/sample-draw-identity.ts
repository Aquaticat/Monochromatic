//region Sample draw identity
// One draw's fingerprint, so a graded sheet can be proved to belong to the
// manifest it is scored against.
//
// The seed alone cannot do this. The draw is deterministic in its SEED but not
// in its POOL, and the pool grows with every entry that settles, so the same
// seed at the same corpus commit yields a DIFFERENT set of items once another
// entry lands. Two draws can therefore agree on seed, on corpus pin, and on
// item count while describing different issues, and the scorers join sheet to
// manifest BY POSITION. That join would then mislabel every verdict, silently,
// and produce a precision figure with no error anywhere in it.
//
// The digest covers identities only: which issue sat at which position, plus
// the seed and pin that name the draw. Never the rendered sheet body. The whole
// purpose of a sheet is that a human writes grades into it, so a digest over
// its text would break the moment it was used for what it is for.
