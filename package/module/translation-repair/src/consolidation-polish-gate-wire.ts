 PROSE LINE BREAKS ARE THE PAGE'S WRAP. Class one hundred fifty-two
 (yingying12, 2026-09-26): both candidates on a prose slice are wrapped at
 their semantic boundaries by the same rule before the gate
 (`consolidation-polish-round.ts`), so where they break lines follows from
 the wording and is nobody's choice; the sheet named "line structure" among
 what the polish may not change, and the polish replacing the calque "It is
 a pity that all this stopped abruptly" tied 2 to 2 with both base ballots
 citing it.

 SHOWN ONE LINE A PARAGRAPH. Class one hundred fifty-three (XingZ6014,

 "both candidates by the same rule" was false on slices 36, 61 and 64 and three
 ballots still weighed the polish's added breaks. The sheet now shows both
 candidates folded (`soft-break-fold.ts`), and the policy says so.
