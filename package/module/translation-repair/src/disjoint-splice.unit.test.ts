/**
 Tests for writing disjoint edits into a text in one pass (ledger B70).

 THE REFERENCE IS THE OLD WAY: every edit spliced in one at a time, last first
 so earlier offsets held. The one-pass writer must give the same text for any
 disjoint edits, in any order they are given.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention.
