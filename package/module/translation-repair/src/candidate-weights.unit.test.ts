/**
 * Tests for what a candidate is recorded as having drawn.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. A decline has to say by how much the leader fell short
 * and against what, so every candidate gets a row even when nobody named it,
 * and a row counts only ballots that actually carried weight. Measured on
 * 2026-08-25, counting weightless ballots as well failed no case.
 *
 * WHEN A WEIGHTLESS BALLOT CAN NAME A CANDIDATE. Not today: the producer sets
 * `best` and weight together, so a ballot naming a candidate in range always
 * carries `FULL_VOTE_WEIGHT` or `SELF_VOTE_WEIGHT`, and both are above zero.
 * It becomes reachable the moment `SELF_VOTE_WEIGHT` is tuned to zero, which
 * is a knob rather than a constant, and the counts would then credit a judge`s
 * vote for its own work as a ballot while the weight it contributed stayed
 * nothing. That is the reading this case pins.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
