/**
 Guards class one hundred fifty-six (2026-09-26): under the
 owner's standing instruction of 2026-09-25 ("whenever you see anything that
 can be translated better do it"), three words from a student's life join the
 rendering glossary. 初中 shipped as "junior middle school" where four of the
 five archive passages that render it write "junior high school"; 自考 as
 "self-taught exams", which names no examination in English; 压力话 as
 "pressured remarks". The glossary seeds the English each should take and
 refuses the calques.

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
