//region Sheet binding
// The one check both scorers run before joining a graded sheet to a manifest.
//
// Kept in one place because the two scorers ask the same question and had two
// copies of half the answer: `score-probe` compared seed and corpus pin, and
// `score-agreement` compared nothing at all, so it would happily score any
// sheet against whatever pre-grades sat under the default seed.
//
// The join is BY POSITION. Nothing in a sheet names an issue: the sheets print
// no issue ids, deliberately, because a 64-hex string is noise a human has to
// read past. So the sheet's header is the only evidence available that these
// grades are about these items, and everything this module can check lives
// there.

 Refuses a sheet and manifest that do not describe one draw.

 Seed and corpus pin are checked first and always, because a disagreement
 there is unambiguous. They are not sufficient on their own: the draw is
 deterministic in its seed but not in its POOL, and the pool grows with every
 entry that settles, so one seed at one corpus commit names different item
 sets at different times. Equal item counts do not help either, since two
 unrelated draws of the same size match on count and mislabel every verdict.
