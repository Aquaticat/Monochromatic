//region Image OCR
// READING A PICTURE WITHOUT ASKING A MODEL, which is the first thing to try and
// on this corpus usually the last.
//
// THREE REASONS IT COMES FIRST, and the owner's ruling named the third.
//
// MOST PICTURES HAVE NOTHING TO READ. Measured with `tesseract` over all 191
// distinct source-referenced assets: 119 carry no text at all. They are
// photographs of people. A reader declining those is the RIGHT answer, not a
// miss, and asking two vision models about them spends quota to be told so.
//
// IT AGREES WITH THE MODELS. On the six assets where a model reading is on
// record, six of six agree in both directions: tesseract read the three they
// read, at 205, 388 and 540 characters against their 390/394, 448/454 and
// 590/632, and found nothing in the three they declined.
//
// IT IS DETERMINISTIC, which the models are not. `wangzihao980/Word1.webp`
// corroborated at 0.643 in one probe and disagreed at 0.087 in a corpus pass,
// same bytes and same two models. Putting a party that cannot vary on one side
// of the comparison removes half that variance.
//
// IT HAS NO CONTEXT CAP EITHER. 45 of the 191 assets are past the smaller
// reader's byte allowance and cannot be sent to a model at all without
// re-encoding. Tesseract reads them as they are.
//
// THIS MAKES `tesseract` A DEPLOYMENT DEPENDENCY. It is reported as a named
// unavailable reason rather than silently skipped, because a run that quietly
// stopped reading pictures would look exactly like a corpus that stopped
// carrying them.

/**
 How the OCR reader is invoked, including the language data it needs.

 handles, dates and place names inside otherwise Chinese text.

// THE TEXTLESS LINE IS `MIN_READING_CHARS`, IMPORTED rather than copied: the
// copy this replaced was a literal 16 that could drift from the value it
// claimed to be drawn from.
// Shortest OCR yield treated as text rather than as noise, in characters after
// whitespace is removed.
//
// STATED AS A CHOICE, because the measurement does not make it for us. The
// yield over 191 assets runs 0, then 1, 2, 4 and up through 2965 with no gap
// anywhere: 119 assets return nothing and the remaining 72 form a continuum. So
// there is no boundary to discover, only a line to draw.
//
// DRAWN AT `MIN_READING_CHARS`, the value `image-reading-sense.ts` already uses
// for a model reading too short to be a reading. Reusing it keeps ONE notion of
// "too short to be a transcription" rather than inventing a second that would
// drift from it. At this line 60 assets read and 12 low-yield ones are called
// textless.
//
// THE ERRORS ARE NOT SYMMETRIC, which is why the line sits where it does rather
// than lower. Calling a caption textless loses a little evidence about a
// picture that 79 of 1260 slices mention. Calling noise text spends model calls
// on nothing and, worse, offers the corroboration stage two pieces of garbage
// that may agree with each other.

// THE PROGRAMS ARE RUN THROUGH A FUNCTION THE CALLER HANDS IN, never reached
// for. A decoder and an OCR reader are programs on a machine, so a function
// that starts them by itself can be tested only on a machine that carries
// them and their language data, and its tests then say what that machine
// does. The runner is REQUIRED (ledger M70): a default would be the
// production value, and a test that left it out would start the real
// programs. A run names the real runner, `runInstalledProgram`, once, where
// it builds its picture sources (`corpus-run/pass-visual-evidence.ts`).
