/**
 Guards class one hundred forty-five (XingZ6013, 2026-09-26). The original
 credits a song as 《[title](url)》, the title the link's text. The
 consolidated candidate wrote an English title the web lookup offered and
 kept the Han as the link's text in parentheses after it, so the class
 ninety-eight floor read the Han as a gloss beside its English and let it
 through; the title pass then rewrote the Han link text into the heading's
 rendering, and the page credited one song under two English titles. A
 link's text is what the reader sees as the work's name, so a Han title
 standing as a link's whole text is never a gloss. Cat-themed invention
 throughout; no corpus content appears here.
