/**
 * Tests for the lexicographic order that decides which candidate ships.
 *
 * `selectRepairCandidate` is already covered, and it exercises these branches
 * indirectly, but nothing asserted the ORDER OF THE TIERS themselves. That
 * order is a design decision rather than an implementation detail: it encodes
 * what the pipeline is willing to trade for what, and issue #53 is an open
 * question about exactly that. A test that pins each tier against every tier
 * below it turns a future reordering into a deliberate act instead of a silent
 * one.
 *
 * Each case holds every HIGHER tier equal and makes every LOWER tier favor the
 * loser, so passing can only mean the tier under test decided the comparison.
 * Every candidate states all five measurements rather than overriding a shared
 * base: the comparison IS the five numbers, and a reader should see both sides
 * without merging anything in their head.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention.
