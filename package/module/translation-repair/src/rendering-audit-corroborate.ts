// When two auditors are talking about the SAME DEFECT, as against the same
// sentence.
//
// ON FOCUS INTERVALS, not on quoted text. Two voices pointing at one dropped
// negation will not type the same characters: one quotes the clause, the other
// quotes the two words that carry it. What they have in common is a position in
// a document, so that is what this compares.
//
// EXACT INTERVALS CORROBORATE, AND NOTHING ELSE DOES. Overlap is reported and
// never merged, because a merge on overlap is a false claim of agreement: one
// sentence can carry two changed numbers, and two voices each finding a
// different one overlap perfectly while agreeing on nothing. A near miss says
// what it is, which is two claims about neighbouring text whose relationship a
// human or a later rule has to decide.
//
// NO TRANSITIVE CLUSTERING. If A overlaps B and B overlaps C, that does not put
// A and C in one defect: a single wide span would otherwise bridge two narrow
// findings that share no text at all. Every relation here is pairwise, and
// membership comes only from an exact key.
//
// EVERY MEMBER IS KEPT. A defect reports the claims it was built from, one per
// voice per claim, because the aggregate is what a later calibration re-reads,
// and a summary that discarded the voices could not answer a question nobody
// has asked yet.

 * How many distinct voices must find one defect for it to count as
 * corroborated.

 * question this instrument answers first is whether a defect is THERE, and a

 * tally keeps the count, so a stricter rule can be applied later without
