// CLASS NINETY-FIVE (hulicaijia14, 2026-09-23). The roster paired 14 of 15
// blocks and left one original definition unpaired, so the map read off the
// definitions alone landed on an archive label while one original label stood
// unaccounted for; the archive's labels stood, the lanes wrote the original's
// labels into a page keyed by the archive's, the class ninety-two floor
// refused the archive's own paragraph for "dropping" the original's marker
// and the entry stopped. The paired slices carried the missing relation the
// whole time (the paragraph citing the note pairs with its rendering, marker
// beside marker). WHERE THE DEFINITIONS ALONE DO NOT CLOSE, THE SLICES ARE
// READ BESIDE THEM: both readings' relations go through the one consistency
// check, so a slice that contradicts a definition pair still leaves the
// archive standing, and a slice that only confirms or completes one closes
// the map.
