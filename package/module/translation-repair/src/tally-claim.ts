// One claim's arithmetic, split out of `tally-votes.ts` so the reading that
// records the ballots has somewhere to live beside the sums it produces.
//
// `tally-votes.ts` decides; this file counts. The split follows the line cap
// rather than preceding it, but the boundary is the honest one: nothing here
// reads a cluster, a severity or a status.
