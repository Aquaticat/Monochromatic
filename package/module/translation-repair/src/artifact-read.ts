// skipped, because silently dropping one would shrink the accepted population
// and bias the graded precision. Non-accepted issues (rejected, needs-human)
// are legitimately excluded -- they are not accepted, so not in the
// denominator. Category and severity stay plain display strings, so no
// off-taxonomy value is ever a reason to drop an issue.
