//region Artifact dispatch
// Choosing which generation's reader an artifact belongs to, and nothing else.
//
// EVERY GENERATION GETS ITS OWN READER, and this file holds none of them. A
// single reader that tried to cover all three would have to decide, per field,
// whether a missing value means an older file or a malformed one, which is the
// reading that made version 1's optional fields ambiguous in the first place.
//
// THE RESULT IS DISCRIMINATED BY GENERATION rather than merged into one shape.
// Version 1 answers with one status, one output and one issue list; version 2
// has two lanes, no singular anything, and a comparison. Flattening the second
// into the first would pick a lane, which is the question nobody has decided,
// and a caller that cannot say which generation it is holding cannot ask a
// question either one can answer.
