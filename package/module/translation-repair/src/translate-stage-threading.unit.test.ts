/**
 Guards what the translate stage hands each round and how a round leaves
 when judging fails for a reason that is not an absence.

 THE CITED REFERENCES AND THE ATTESTED LINES travel from `runTranslateStage`
 through `runTranslateRepairs` into both halves of a round: the judges are
 shown what the pages the original cites say, and the translators are shown
 the archive details a cited page states. No stage case passed either, so
 nothing proved they arrive; each is named on the sheet it belongs to.

 AN ABORT while the judges are asked leaves the round as the caller's abort
 reason, by identity. A fault that is not an absence cannot be sent through
 a stage round from outside, since a provider's fault reaches judging as a
 lost voice (`stage-call.ts`); the narrowing that passes one on is tested on
 its own (`translate-absence-narrow.unit.test.ts`).

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
