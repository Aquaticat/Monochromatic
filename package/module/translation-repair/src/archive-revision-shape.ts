//region Archive revision shape
// THE SEVENTY-SEVENTH CLASS (zheermao2, 2026-09-21). The archive block review
// asks reviewers to revise one archive-only block and admits any revision
// that keeps the contributor identities. On the one-line label introducing
// the English rendering of an email exchange ("English translation of the
// preceding email conversation:"), one reviewer answered with a four-block
// letter, its third paragraph cut mid-sentence, and the selection judges
// chose it over the label as "the actual email translation content required
// for the block". The block's own shape is the deterministic bound the lanes
// already hold their candidates to (`translate-validate.ts`): a revision of
// one paragraph is one paragraph, a revised blockquote is a blockquote. A
// removal (an empty revision) is a shape of its own the review allows.
//
// A QUOTED PASSAGE NESTED BELOW THE TOP LEVEL IS COMPARED TOO (ledger B110).
// `sameShape` reads only the top-level block sequence, so a revision keeping
// the block's own shape could still turn a blockquote nested inside a
// container tag, a list, a footnote, or another blockquote into prose;
// `quotedPassageRevisionFindings` reads the parse's own any-depth count.

 Findings for a revision that carries fewer quoted passages, at every depth,

 only the top-level block sequence, so a revision may keep it kind for kind
 while a blockquote nested inside a container tag, a list, a footnote, or
 another blockquote is turned into prose underneath it (ledger B110, the
 twin of the translate floor's `quotedPassageFloorFindings`); a revision of
 another shape is already withheld for its shape.

 to the judges as before. A revision the grammar refuses is withheld, since
 it could not be published either way.
