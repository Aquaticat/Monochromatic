/**
 * Tests for the finding a driver files when it refuses a cached slice.
 *
 * WHY THIS SITS APART from `translate-unheard.unit.test.ts`: `await describe`
 * throws, so a failure in that file`s suite would abort this one before it ran,
 * and a GFP round pointed at either could then prove nothing about the other.
 *
 * WHAT IT PINS is the slice this finding names. A cached record that heard no
 * translator was written by another build, and the driver asks the slice again
 * rather than settling on a wording nobody produced. Measured on 2026-08-25,
 * shifting the index by one failed no case, so a corpus reader chasing the
 * refusal would have opened the neighbouring slice and found nothing wrong with
 * it.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
