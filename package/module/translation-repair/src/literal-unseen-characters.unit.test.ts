/**
 Guards against a character a reader cannot see, or cannot tell from a space,
 standing literally in the package's TypeScript: a soft hyphen, a zero-width
 space or joiner, a bidirectional control, a byte order mark, a variation
 selector or tag character, a no-break or ideographic space, a control
 character. In a test such a character is invisible fixture data, so a reader
 cannot see what the case feeds; in production code it is an invisible member
 of a set or a pattern, so a reader cannot see what the code matches; and a
 diff shows neither. Each is written as its escape instead, which a reader
 can see and a search can find.

 HOW THEY GOT IN. A tool that writes a file from a model's parameters decoded a
 backslash-u escape the model wrote into the character it names (measured on
 2026-10-06 UTC: an edit meant to write the escape of a hyphen wrote a hyphen,
 and a message draft got a byte order mark), so an escape written through such
 a tool can land as the character itself. The scan reads the file, not the
 intent.

 WHAT THE SCAN READS. Every TypeScript file under `src`, tests included, code
 point by code point: a code point with the Unicode property
 `Default_Ignorable_Code_Point`, `White_Space` or the general category `Cc` is
 a finding, except the four a source file is written with (space, tab, line
 feed, carriage return).

 THE FIXTURE CASE COMES FIRST, so the package-wide case is read against a
 scan shown able to find each class (ledger M21). Fixtures are cat-themed;
 every unseen character in them is made with `String.fromCodePoint`, so this
 file holds none.
