/**
 Guards class seventy-nine (shi_Yumiaoya, 2026-09-22): a suicide attempt the
 person SURVIVED shipped as "she ended her life by taking a large amount of
 medication", two sentences before the ORIGINAL has her wake in the ICU after
 six days, on two consecutive runs, with every candidate writing it and every
 ballot approving it as reader protection. The reader-protection rule itself
 prescribed the words: its sample sentence read "the page says that she ended
 her life", so 自杀 was rendered as a death whatever the ORIGINAL went on to
 say. The rule now says that 自杀 names the act and not its outcome, and that
 where the ORIGINAL goes on to a rescue or a waking the English says an
 attempt.

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
