/**
 Tests the retry ladder when the caller aborts while it sleeps a backoff after
 a transport failure, where no reply stands to be reported and the failure
 itself is what the ladder surfaces. The cases of a rate-limit reply and of an
 abort tripped by the transport itself are in `transient-retry.unit.test.ts`.
 Fixtures are cat-themed invention.
