// LEDGER P13 (the whole-package audit, 2026-09-28): OpenRouter's decisions
// reference documents a 413 for an oversized payload and says nothing of a
// state past the model's context. Probed that day with a cat-themed state of
// 45,046 characters, the evidence first and then last: both came back HTTP
// 400 with the error type `max_tokens_exceeded`, so the endpoint refuses a
// state it cannot hold and never decides on a truncated one. The endpoint is
// therefore the only tokenizer this package needs: nothing estimates a
// state's size before it is sent.
//
// WHY IT CAN HAPPEN: `ce824d933` put the house rules in every select state,
// 4,085 tokens on the same probe, and 4 of the 13,878 Jev prompts in the run
// logs (largest 30,203) would now pass the 32,000-token context.
