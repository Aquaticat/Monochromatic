// WHERE THE PAGE RENDERS A REFERENCE ANOTHER WAY, a candidate owes one
// rendering, not both. Decided by the owner on 2026-09-04 ("Either
// rendering") after the luxuanwen3 pass of that day stopped at its first
// paragraph: the original links twitter.com, the archive's page links x.com,
// and the per-key maximum of `mergeAtoms` owed a candidate both, so the
// archive's own paragraph was ineligible and no proposal could pass. Measured
// over the pinned corpus: eight of ninety-three entries carry a link the
// archive rewrote (a moved domain, a trailing slash, a same-language
// Wikipedia article); footnotes never diverge both ways.
//
// A REWRITE IS READ OFF THE SET DIFFERENCE, per atom kind: atoms only the
// original carries and atoms only the page carries, of the same kind, form
// one pool, and the candidate owes exactly the larger side's count from it.
// That is the block rule's arithmetic (the page is a floor, the original
// sets the ceiling with it) applied to references. A kind that diverges in
// one direction only is an addition or a drop and stays owed as before;
// carrying both renderings is refused, since a link the original carries
// once and the page carries once is one link on the page.

// LEDGER B37 (2026-09-30). The floor pushed one sentence per missing copy and

// "your translation does not" carry it, and one carrying a link three times
// where the original carries it once was told "the ORIGINAL does not". A model
// told a side lacks an atom it has can remove every copy and be refused again

 Findings for atoms the candidate owes and did not carry, invented, or

 Compared as a MULTISET rather than in order, because a translation
 reorders clauses legitimately and a link moving within a sentence is not
 damage. What is damage is a reference that stopped existing, one that
 appeared from nowhere, or both renderings of one reference side by side.
