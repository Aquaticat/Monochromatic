//region Neutral pronoun rendering
// A TRANSLATION THAT LEAVES THE CORPUS'S NEUTRAL PRONOUN IN LATIN LETTERS has
// not translated it. The sources write `TA`, `Ta` or `ta` for a person who did
// not specify a pronoun, and English has a rendering for that: singular they.
//
// WHY THIS IS A FLOOR RULE AND NOT A PROMPT ALONE. The SS3B_0016 run of
// 2026-09-04 (13:51 UTC) shipped "a small room for Ta, to give Ta's memorial a
// little warmth" on a page that says "they" for the same person everywhere
// else, and three of five contest ballots plus the consolidation gate kept it
// as "the original's neutral Ta". Judges reading a passage cannot tell an
// untranslated word from a preserved choice when the house rule names TA as a
// pronoun the original uses and never says what English makes of it. The rule
// now says so, and this refuses the candidate before any judge is asked.
//
// WHAT THE CORPUS SAYS. Measured over the pinned corpus on 2026-09-04: sources
// write the pronoun as `TA` in 2 entries, `Ta` in 7 and `ta` in 8, every
// occurrence a pronoun; of those entries' archives, one (a rewrite) keeps a
// bare `TA`, and the rest render it "they". An archive that kept it fails this
// rule as a standing text, which is what the owner's ineligible-standing
// decision provides for: the slate prefers a valid proposal. Remeasured on
// 2026-09-29 under the token reading (`pronoun-entry-census.mjs`): the same
// figures, the archive XingZ60's. The old list read `Ta` in 6 sources,
// missing qianyuanakg's.
//
// THE PRONOUN IS A TOKEN OF ITS OWN (ledger B23), read by `tokenStarts`
// (`word-bounds.ts`): `DATA`, `STATION`, `meta`, a romanised handle, a path
// segment and an address all contain the letters and none is the pronoun.
// The floor used to count an occurrence only between listed marks, whitespace
// or characters at or above U+2E80, compared by UTF-16 unit. That list missed
// a doubled Chinese dash and a slash after han in three originals
// (XingZ60, Mizuki_Yuuki, qianyuanakg), so the floor never applied to those
// slices, and an English em dash beside a kept `TA` in stored renderings
// (XingZ60, noname), so it passed them (`pronoun-disagreement-census.mjs`,
// 2026-09-29). The listed 「」 was redundant: it and 『』 sit above U+2E80.
//
// WHAT THE TOKEN READING DOES NOT SEE: `he/TA` and `Well...Ta` read as one
// token each, as an address would, so neither counts. The old list counted
// neither; the census found neither in any original or stored rendering.
