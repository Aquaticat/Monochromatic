/**
 Tests that an applied edit never nests a blockquote deeper than its context
 allows (TianqiChen66621 slice 16).

 WHY. An editor's patch on TianqiChen66621 slice 16 resolved six accepted
 issues and left the last quoted line as `> >`, a quote inside a quote that
 neither the original nor the archive has, and the page shipped it. Over
 every artifact, ten repair-lane slices nested a quote two levels deep where
 neither side nests, and every one shipped; the translate lane did it none.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention mirroring corpus structure only.
