//region Translate slice
// One slice from prepared pair to settled record: translate it, judge it, and
// decide whether the archive text may be replaced by what won.
//
// The alignment guard runs AFTER the stage rather than instead of it. Running
// it first would make the lane skip slices, and a skipped slice is
// indistinguishable in every artifact from a slice the judges left alone. It
// also throws away the evidence: what the judges chose for a mispaired slice is
// exactly what says the pairing was wrong.

/**
 Translates one slice and settles what the driver accepts for it.
 
 @param client - injected model client
 
 @param slice - prepared slice pair
 
 @param prepared - document the slice came from, for declared names and
 governance
 
 @param models - translator and judge rosters
 
 @param neighbouringSourceText - original of the sections either side, shown to
 the judges as context they are not asked to render. Absent by default, so the
 lane behaves exactly as it did; the window trial supplies it on the slices
 the displacement screen flags, to read whether the replacement rate falls when a judge can see
 that the archive put this slice's content next door
 
 @param neighbouringIncumbentText - archive English of the sections either
 side, shown so a passage missing here can be recognised next door rather than
 read as one the archive never had
 
 @param pictureContext - what the pictures this slice and its neighbours show
 were read as, shown to translators and judges as source evidence they could
 otherwise not see
 
 @param pictureFindings - one line per picture no reading is available for,
 carried into the record so a run says which pictures went unread rather than
 leaving their absence indistinguishable from a slice showing none
 
 @param archiveDispute - dispute over this slice's archive rendering (class
 one hundred seven), whose repair text is judged as the incumbent in the
 archive's place and ships where the judges keep it
 
 @param signal - caller abort honored by every exchange
 
 @param perCallTimeoutMs - deadline per exchange
 
 @param l - driver logger
 
 @returns Settled record, whether the stage's text was accepted or refused
 
 @throws {@link import('./translation-repair-interrupted-error.ts').TranslationRepairInterruptedError}
 when absent-passage correction repeats exact task or providers remain unavailable
