//region Unchanged chunk outcome
// The record a chunk leaves behind when the translation ships exactly as it
// stood. Three exits in `repair-chunk.ts` reach this state for three different
// reasons, and they spread one shape rather than restating it, so a field added
// to the contract cannot land on two of them and be forgotten on the third.

/**
 * Builds the outcome for a chunk whose text nothing changed.
 *
 * THE CRITICS' WORK IS KEPT, which is the whole reason this is not a bare
 * empty record. Nothing was repaired, but the votes, the contradiction screen
 * and the attributions were all paid for and are read by later calibration.
 *
 * @param sliceIndex - position of this chunk in the document
 *
 * @param targetText - translation as it stood, which is what ships
 *
 * @param critic - critic phase result whose telemetry survives the exit
 *
 * @returns Outcome every unchanged exit spreads, less the two fields each exit supplies itself
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const unchangedOutcome = unchangedChunkOutcome({ sliceIndex, targetText, critic, },);
 * ```
