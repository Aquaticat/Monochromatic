/**
 Tests for the transport-level transient retry.

 `exchangeWithRetry` had no test. It sits under every model call in the
 pipeline, so its two failure modes are both expensive: retrying something
 permanent burns the flat-rate provider's capacity on a guaranteed rejection,
 and NOT retrying something transient throws away a voice the ensemble needed,
 which shows up much later as a thinner quorum rather than as an error.

 The abort case gets the most attention. A caller abort during backoff must
 stop the loop rather than burn the remaining attempts, and it must surface
 the failure that actually happened rather than a generic one.

 The two guard errors, degeneration and overrun, are both ends this system
 chose rather than weather. They ride one predicate instead of two separate
 class checks, so both get a case here: a check that named only one of them
 would pass this whole suite while the ladder re-bought every overrun.

 Every case uses a tiny backoff base so the suite stays fast; the delay
 arithmetic is jittered and is not what these assert.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention.
