//region Nesting html block
// WHERE THE PARSER MAY BE READING RAW HTML, so that a line which looks like a fence
// there opens no fenced block. CommonMark reads a line opening with an angle
// bracket as an html block that runs to the next blank line, and five kinds
// run to an end marker instead, blank lines and fence-like lines included
// (`micromark-core-commonmark@2.0.4` `lib/html-flow.js`). The scan skips what
// a fence holds, so it must not take a fence line in raw html for one.
//
// THE READING ERRS TOWARD STAYING IN HTML: it never leaves a block before
// the marker the grammar ends it by, and it enters one for any line opening
// with an angle bracket, whether or not the grammar would. A text it keeps
// in html longer than the parser does is counted rather than skipped.
