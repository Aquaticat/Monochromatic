// lane, is the difference between a status that is true of the run and one that
// is true of a stage.

// One builder serves both driver exits so the two cannot drift; the blocked
// exit already reported `resolved: false` correctly while carrying no repair
// provenance at all, which is exactly the kind of divergence a shared builder
