/**
 * Tests for telling a model declining to read a picture from a model reading
 * one.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS ITS OWN SCREEN. Two refusals corroborate each other. Real traffic
 * on 2026-08-19 returned `There is no text visible in this image.` from one
 * reader and `No legible text is visible.` from the other, and the pair stage
 * marked them corroborated at 0.565 trigram overlap, because two ways of saying
 * "there is nothing here" share their vocabulary exactly as two transcriptions
 * of one passage do. Both had slipped the phrase list by a single word.
 *
 * SO THESE PIN THE SHAPE, not a wording. A refusal negates, names the picture
 * or its text, and is a sentence rather than a passage. All three are required,
 * and one case here removes each in turn to show that each is load-bearing.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention, except the two refusals, which are the
 * exact replies that caused this and carry no corpus content.
