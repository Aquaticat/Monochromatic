//region Roster configuration
// Whether a lane was configured with anybody to ask, checked before it spends
// an hour discovering it was not.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR is silence that looks like success. A stage whose
// voices all fail settles rather than throwing, deliberately, because throwing
// on an outage would write an answer the pipeline never received into the slice
// cache. A stage configured with an EMPTY roster produces the same observation:
// no exchanges, no findings, a settled unchanged document. Downstream nothing
// can tell them apart, so a corpus pass under a misconfiguration spends hours
// writing a directory of vacuous artifacts that later analysis reads as clean.
//
// CONFIGURATION ONLY, never `heardCritics === 0` or any other run-time count.
// The first is deterministic and the operator's to fix; the second is the
// transient silence the cache rule exists to tolerate, and refusing it would
// turn a provider outage into a failed pass.
//
// EVERY EMPTY ROLE IN ONE ERROR, because an operator fixing one at a time pays
// a whole preflight per role.
