/**
 * Tests for the refinement wire guard and its binding step.
 *
 * Both read untrusted model output. `isRefineReportWire` is the only thing
 * standing between a malformed reply and code that assumes `rewrites` is an
 * array of well-shaped rewrites, and `resolveRefineRewrites` decides what a
 * miscounted paragraph number does. Neither had a test.
 *
 * The binding step's stated contract is that it drops rather than throws: a
 * rewriter miscounting its own list says nothing about the paragraphs it got
 * right. So the cases below check that a bad item is recorded AND dropped,
 * while its well-formed neighbours survive.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention.
