/**
 * Tests for the `mdx-downgraded` integrity signal.
 *
 * `downgradeCount` had no test. It is four lines, and it decides an integrity
 * verdict: candidate selection ranks integrity above every other measurement,
 * so a patch that raises this count loses to unchanged no matter how many
 * issues it fixed. A count that silently included the wrong finding kind would
 * therefore discard correct repairs, and a count that missed real downgrades
 * would ship text whose document grammar the patch broke.
 *
 * The kind filter is the whole function, so the cases pin it against the other
 * finding kind the parser actually emits rather than against an invented one.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention.
