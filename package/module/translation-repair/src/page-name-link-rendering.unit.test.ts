/**
 Tests which archive link renders which link of the original, where both
 documents link one href. An href names no one link: a page links one
 destination under a name in one sentence and under other words in another,
 and a table keyed by href gave every link of the original to it the last
 text the archive wrote for it. Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus
 content appears here.
