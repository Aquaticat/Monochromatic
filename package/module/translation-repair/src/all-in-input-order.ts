//region All in input order
// Waits for members that already run side by side and reports what happened
// to them as a property of the INPUT, never of which member finished first.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. `Promise.all` rejects with whichever member rejects first
// BY COMPLETION. Where several members fail in one call (two page reads of a
// commit the clone lacks, two logs that do not exist, two providers that
// refuse), each failure names its own member, so the message an operator, a
// log line or a case reads said whichever git child, file read or request
// happened to end first. Under load that is not the member the input lists
// first, and one input printed two different refusals on two runs.
//
// WHAT THIS KEEPS. The work still runs side by side: the members are started
// by the caller before this is handed them. Where every member succeeds the
// result is in input order and nothing waited longer than `Promise.all` would
// have. Where members fail, the failure thrown is the one of the first member
// in input order, the very value that member rejected with, so its class, its
// message and its cause are exactly what that member reports on its own.
//
// WHAT THIS COSTS. A failure at one position cannot be reported until every
// earlier position has settled, since an earlier member may still fail and
// then it, not the later one, is what the input says. A later member that
// never settles after an earlier one failed costs nothing: the earlier
// failure is thrown without waiting for it. An earlier member that never
// settles holds the report for as long as it holds the whole call under
// `Promise.all`.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO. It cancels nothing and gives no abort precedence: a
// site whose failure must stop its siblings, or where a caller's abort has to
// win over any other failure, keeps its own abort handling around this call,
// and an abort a member rejected with is reported like any other failure,
// as the value that member rejected with.

/**
 What one member came to, kept apart from the others so a rejection is held
 as data until the reader reaches its position.
