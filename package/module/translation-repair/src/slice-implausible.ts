//region Slice implausibility
// Whether one slice pair's sizes are outside what any translation of that
// original plausibly produces, and on which evidence.
//
// ABSOLUTE, DELIBERATELY, and that is the whole reason this is a separate
// predicate rather than a threshold on the document's own expansion. Every
// endpoint here is fixed, so nothing it names was decided by the baseline. That
// is what makes it sound to REMOVE what it names from the set that sets the
// baseline: a relative predicate used the same way would define the centre in
// terms of itself.
//
// WHAT THEY ARE MADE OF, measured over the pinned commit's 92 pairs under
// deterministic pairing. Of the 36 eligible slices tripping anything, block
// disparity is the SOLE cause for 20; the ratio tails are 16 slices across 14
// entries. The two behave differently under production pairing, which is why
// they are reported as separate reasons rather than one boolean: a roster-paired
// sweep of 29 entries took 64 flags down to 40 and never added one, and block
// disparity is what a re-pairing moves.
//
// THE TAILS AND THE GAP THEREFORE ANSWER DIFFERENT QUESTIONS. A ratio tail says
// this translation is the wrong size for this original. A block gap says the
// PAIRING is not to be trusted here, which makes the ratio meaningless rather
// than extreme. Both disqualify a slice from setting a baseline; only the tails
// describe a fault in the rendering itself.
