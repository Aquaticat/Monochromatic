//region Slice cache contract
// The shape a lane's resumable per-slice cache has, independent of what a lane
// stores in it.
//
// Generic because two lanes now cache slices and their values have nothing in
// common: a repair outcome carries issues, regions and checker verdicts, a
// translate record carries a slate, ballots and an alignment assessment. One
// union-valued map plus a cast after lookup is how a repair outcome ends up
// resumed into a translate run, which no reader downstream could detect: the
// artifact would record a single pipeline over internally mixed slices.
//
// Injected like the client, so a driver's result stays a function of its inputs
// and its resumed values. `persist` is a write-through side effect that never
// feeds back into the result.

/**
 * Cross-run cache making a large document resumable.
 *
 * A run aborted at the hard cap resumes from the last settled slice instead of
 * recomputing from scratch.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const cache: SliceCache<string> = {
 *   resumed: new Map(),
 *   persist: async ({ key, serialized, },) => writeSliceFile({ key, serialized, },),
 * };
 * ```
