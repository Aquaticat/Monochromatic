//region Archive footnote relabel
// THE ARCHIVE'S FOOTNOTE LABELS FOLLOW THE ORIGINAL'S, decided after the
// yuki418330012 page of 2026-09-08 shipped its two markers pointing at each
// other's notes. The original writes 洲洲[^2] and 真理[^1]; the archive had
// renumbered them by first appearance, Zhouzhou[^1] and Zhenli[^2], with its
// definitions numbered to match. Every lane judged the body against the
// original, so the body followed the original's labels, while the archive's
// two definitions were left standing as they were (the roster paired neither,
// and the original's definitions, rendered as an insertion, were withdrawn as
// duplicates). The page carried `Zhenli[^1]` above `[^1]: Yuki's substitute
// parent`. THE NINETEENTH CLASS: a footnote is a relation between slices,
// and two slices that each followed a different numbering agree with
// themselves and not with each other.
//
// THE FIX IS UPSTREAM OF EVERY LANE. Once the archive's labels are rewritten
// to the original's, label equality IS the correspondence: a definition
// pairs with the definition of the same label, the body's markers agree with
// the incumbent's, and a definition that renders the wrong note is a fidelity
// defect the lanes see and repair like any other.
//
// READ OFF THE PAIRED SLICES, positionally. Within one slice the original and
// the archive carry the same passage, so the k-th distinct marker on one side
// is the k-th on the other. A slice whose two sides carry different counts of
// distinct markers says nothing about the labels (the archive dropped or added
// a note there, which the lanes see as the fidelity defect it is; hakureico's
// archive carries no [^2] at all) and is left out of the reading, named. Two
// slices that disagree about one label leave the archive as it is with a
// warning: a wrong relabel would be the defect this exists to stop.

 as the document spells it. It once ended "where an earlier slice mapped
 [^X]": X was an original label when one archive label met two, an archive
 label when two met one, and in either case the parser's case-folded key
 rather than the document's spelling, and "slice" was the later claim's kind
 of place, so a slice contradicting a definition pair blamed a slice.
