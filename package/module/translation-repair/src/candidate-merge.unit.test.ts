/**
 Tests for collapsing identical candidates while keeping every author.
 
 The defect these exist for is silent in every log: when duplicates stand as
 separate candidates, the ballot splits and the self-vote discount stops
 applying, because each copy is credited to one model and the others look
 disinterested in text they wrote themselves.
 
 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
