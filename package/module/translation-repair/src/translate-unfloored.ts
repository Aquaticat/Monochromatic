//region Unfloored slice
// What the translate stage settles on, before any round, for a slice the
// deterministic source floor can compare nothing on (ledger B43): an original
// no grammar reads, or a page none does.
//
// NOTHING IS ASKED, because nothing asked could be used. The floor passes no
// candidate on such a slice; the author repair let one stand unvalidated, so
// an admitted insertion shipped a rendering nobody could check, and on a slice
// the archive translates the consolidation refused every text alike and
// shipped the archive, so the calls bought nothing. A finding about an
// unreadable original is also one no translator can act on, so a revision
// round is not the place either.

/**
 Names a slice a stage settled without asking, the way every stage finding
 is named.

 @param stage - which stage settled it: the translate stage (ledger B43),
 the consolidation (ledger B45) or the consolidation polish (ledger B48)

 @param detail - why the floor could compare nothing, in its own words

 @returns Finding in scorecard-stable wording

 @example
 ```ts
 const finding = unflooredFinding({ stage: 'translate', detail: 'original could not be read: ...', },);

/**
 Settles a slice the floor can compare nothing on: on the archive where

 @param incumbentText - archive wording as the stage judges it

 @param incumbentKind - whether the archive holds a translation here

 @param detail - why the floor could compare nothing

 @param l - stage logger

 @returns The archive standing, with nobody asked

 @throws {@link TranslateAbsenceError} carrying `unfloored` where the archive
