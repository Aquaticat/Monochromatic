//region Artifact exact guards
// The two checks a versioned artifact reader needs and a lenient one does not:
// refusing keys the schema does not name, and reading a value whose shape the
// schema deliberately leaves open.
//
// APART FROM `artifact-guard.ts` because that file holds the checks every
// reader shares, these belong to readers that enforce a SCHEMA, and it is
// already at its own size. Nothing here overlaps it: those answer "is this a
// string", these answer "does this record say anything the version does not
// describe".
//
// WHY EXACTNESS MATTERS AT ALL, since a tolerant reader is the usual advice: a
// version number is a promise about what a file means, and an unknown key is
// either a field from a generation this reader does not understand or a typo
// that silently dropped a field it does. Both are cases where reading on
// produces a confident answer about a file nobody wrote. The tolerance this
// schema does grant is NAMED and bounded: each lane's raw `result`, which
// `requireOpenRecord` reads and says why.
