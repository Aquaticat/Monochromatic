//
// WHY THE WALK CAN ANSWER THIS AND THE HEADING ALIGNER COULD NOT. The heading
// aligner reports one decision per source row and then every unclaimed target
// row, so it carries no cursor and its skip position had to be recovered from
// the table (`align-headings-optimal.ts`). This walk is monotone by
// construction: its steps ARE the cursor, in document order, so the place a
// source block is skipped at is simply where it sits in the sequence.
//
// A MERGE IS NOT AN OMISSION, and the walk already separates them. Two originals
// rendered as one translation block arrive as a `paired` step followed by a
// `source-only` step carrying `continuesPairing`, and that second original IS
// placed, against a block the first already claimed. Only a `source-only` step
// WITHOUT that marker is an original nothing rendered. This is the same
// predicate `declined-target-runs.ts` uses to decide whether a pairing left an
// original unplaced, kept identical on purpose: two readings of "unplaced" that
// drifted apart would disagree about the same document.

 Reads the block a walk step names on one side.

 LOUD RATHER THAN ABSENT. A step that named a block its side lacks used to
 read as a step carrying no block there: the grouper filtered it out, the
 anchors read it as a step that consumes no translation, and a walk pairing
 one original with a translation block past the last grouped to no runs at
 all, the whole section gone and nothing said. `walkIntoRuns` reads every
 step's blocks through here before anything else reads the walk, and
 `renderedSpan` reads through here too, so that state has one refusal and
 one wording.

 @param nodes - one side's blocks, which the walk indexes

 @param index - block the step names on that side

 @param side - which side the blocks are, for the refusal

 @param at - step's position in the walk, for the refusal

 @returns Block the step names

 @throws Error when the step names no block of that side, which no walk
 built in this package does: `alignBlocks` walks these very blocks, and
 `blockPairingToSteps` refuses a pairing that names a block its side lacks

 ```ts
 const node = blockAtStep({ nodes: targetNodes, index: step.targetIndex, side: 'translation', at: 3, },);

 translation carries anything between them, so the two are not
 interchangeable and the forward reading is the one that keeps the insertion
 outside a rendering rather than inside it.
