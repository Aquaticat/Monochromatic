/**
 * Tests for the archive verdict the lane contest settles beside its choice.

 * WHAT IS UNDER TEST is the gap `#181` opened: a contest that backs neither
 * candidate used to say nothing at all about the text already published, even
 * though that text is what ships when both candidates lose. The verdict is an
 * ORTHOGONAL BALLOT FIELD, so these cases check that it settles by the same

 * artifact written before the question existed.
