/**
 * Wire-level test that the schema reaches the model on the Synthetic path.
 *
 * SEPARATE FILE BY NECESSITY, not preference: `synthetic-client.unit.test.ts`
 * is near its line budget, and `MXL` forbids raising one. The seam under test
 * is also narrower than that file's subject, which is the whole client.
 *
 * WHY ONLY THIS PROVIDER. `#216` was opened believing no system prompt carried
 * its schema. Reading the deciding source refuted that for Charm Hyper:
 * `buildAnthropicBody` routes every schema-bearing call through
 * `renderToolSystemPrompt`, which prints the whole schema into the `system`
 * field with its own format rules. The Synthetic path had nothing of the kind,
 * sending only the API-level `response_format`, so it is the one that changed.
 *
 * READS THE BYTES, not the transform. `schema-prompt.unit.test.ts` covers the
 * pure function. This asserts the property that actually matters: what the
 * provider receives. A transform that worked and a client that ignored it
 * would pass every test in the other file.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
