/**
 * Guard that a picture's transcription, once corroborated, actually reaches
 * the requests `translateDocument` sends, not merely its return value.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: `#107`'s judging window was fully built, wired into
 * the cache key, and sat in production for weeks unused. Nothing failed and no
 * test broke, because nothing asserted what the driver actually SENT to a
 * model; every test that passed was reading `translateDocument`'s return
 * value, which the missing wiring never touched. Pictures wire through the
 * same two places, `translateSliceKey` and `attemptTranslateSlice`, from the
 * same `pictures.context` value computed once in `translate-document.ts`, so
 * the same gap is possible here, and this file is the guard against it
 * repeating.
 *
 * WHAT IS PINNED, per exchange the recording client double captures before it
 * answers: a corroborated reading's own transcription text reaches the
 * TRANSLATOR sheet (`translate-wire.ts`'s "WHAT THE PICTURES HERE SAY" block)
 * and the JUDGE sheet (`candidate-select-wire.ts`'s evidence block, carrying
 * `translate-judge.ts`'s label of the same name); a run handed no readings at
 * all sends neither and differs measurably from a run handed one, which is the
 * positive control this guard needs, since an assertion that always passes
 * looks identical to one that works; and an `unavailable` reading leaves a
 * finding naming its asset on the slice record while reaching neither sheet,
 * since `slice-pictures.ts` treats a refused reading as evidence for a person
 * to read rather than a hedge for a model to weigh.
 *
 * Every assertion reads the RECORDED REQUEST the client double captured,
 * never `translateDocument`'s return value: the return value is exactly what
 * the `#107` gap left intact, and reading it again would prove nothing this
 * file exists to prove.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
