// THE PAGE'S DECLARED IDENTITY AS SHEET LINES, assembled in one place (ledger
// B28). Preparation built these inline, so the page title lexicon, which runs
// before preparation and settles lines that join them, was asked for a work's
// official English title without the web lookups and notes that establish
// one. Preparation and the lexicon now read the same assembly; the lexicon
// passes every context line but its own.

/**
 Declared names, pronoun, contributors, notes, community words, the page's own
 names and the caller's context lines, in the order every sheet reads them.

 @param sourceDocument - whole original, parsed

 @param targetDocument - whole archive, parsed

 @param sourceText - whole original as written

 @param targetText - whole archive as written

 @param contextLines - evidence lines bought outside preparation (web lookups
 of the works the original names, other entries' names, settled titles),
 appended last

 @returns Identity lines, none when the page declares and carries nothing

 @example
 ```ts
 const lines = pageIdentityLines({ sourceDocument, targetDocument, sourceText, targetText, contextLines: [], },);
