/**
 Tests for the line a gather round logs about itself (ledger B82).

 WHY BOTH KINDS. A round whose quorum stood measured time either side of it;
 one whose quorum never stood measured neither, and writing zeros there would
 report a measurement the round never made (ledger P12). Each kind is pinned
 whole, since the run-timing reader parses this exact text.

 Fixtures are invented counts and durations; the stage labels are the
 package's own.
