/**
 Guards class one hundred twenty-seven (owner, 2026-09-25: "overdosing",
 "sailor uniform", "National College Entrance Examination"): the owner
 answered three renderings the shi_Yumiaoya27 read had left as written. OD
 shipped as "ODing", jk 裙 as "jk skirt" and 高考 as "Gaokao"; the rendering
 glossary seeds the owner's English and refuses the rest. The OD term carries
 its leading space because every OD in the pinned corpus stands after one and
 a bare OD would match the MOD another entry writes.

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
