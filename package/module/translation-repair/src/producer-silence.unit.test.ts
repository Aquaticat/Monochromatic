/**
 * Tests for naming who a standing table leaves out.
 *
 * THE WHOLE POINT IS THE SPLIT. `producerStandings` carries a row only for a
 * model somebody voted on, and three very different things put a seated model
 * outside that set: a provider that refused it, a slate where every peer
 * proposed the same wording so nothing was ever voted on, and a rewriter that
 * answered every ask and never proposed a candidate. These cases pin that the
 * three stay apart, that a seat which cannot say who answered says so instead
 * of calling the unknown silent, and that a table describing a roster the run
 * never seated is refused rather than reported.
 *
 * Fixtures are model ids and counts, so there is no passage here to invent. The
 * ids come from the catalog, since the roster is what this file is about.
