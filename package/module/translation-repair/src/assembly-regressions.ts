 Parse tolerances that mean the document became LESS parseable, rather than
 that the parser worked around something ordinary.

 A masked comment and a blanked invisible line are ordinary. An unterminated
 comment swallows everything after it, and an MDX downgrade means the strict
 parser refused the document and the loose one accepted it as plain markdown.
 Both are whole-document effects that a per-slice check cannot see: masking
 runs over the whole body before parsing, so one slice's stray `<!--` hides
 markers in slices nobody touched.

 A DELIBERATE SUBSET of the parser's finding kinds, typed by them so a
 misspelt member fails to compile. LEFT OUT are `html-comment-skipped` (the
 masked comment) and `invisible-line-masked` (the blanked line), the two
 ordinary cases. A finding kind the parser gains is therefore not
 a regression until it is added here.
