//region Chunk insertion placement
// `#100` landing 5: which untranslated sections get an anchor to be written at,
// and which are refused.
//
// TWO SIGNATURES, NEVER ONE, per
// `doc/decision/translation-repair-absence-verdict.md`. The aligner must prove
// the section has no partner anywhere and that every optimal alignment skips it
// at the same place, AND the page must be measurably too short to hold what is
// being written into it. A false insertion duplicates text in a memorial page,
// which is the expensive error; a missed one leaves a gap the archive already
// had.
//
// THE SIZE TEST IS THE HALF THE ALIGNER CANNOT DO. The ambiguity is a MERGE
// against an OMISSION, and an aligner reports both as an unpaired source
// section. A merge leaves the content somewhere in a page of ordinary length; an
// omission leaves the page short. Neither signal sees what the other sees, which
// is why both are required rather than whichever is cheaper.
//
// EVERY REFUSAL IS NAMED. Four different things stop an insertion, and they want
// different remedies: a section that may already be on the page, one whose place
// is undetermined, a page that looks complete, and a page already accounted for
// by earlier sections. Reporting them as one "not inserted" is the mistake this
// module exists to avoid, and the same one that made an earlier breadth run
// unreadable.
