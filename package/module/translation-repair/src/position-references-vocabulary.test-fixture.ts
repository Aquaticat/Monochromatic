/**
 The vocabulary of a reference by position (ledger D33), read by
 `position-references.test-fixture.ts` and

 before them that make a phrase a comparison or a placement, and the words
 after them that make it a comparison.

 a hundred nouns reads as a paragraph rather than a hundred lines.

 a phrase found a couple of hundred pointers after nouns no list held ("the

 as pointing, and this list holds the words that read otherwise.
