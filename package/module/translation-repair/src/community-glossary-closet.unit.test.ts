/**
 Guards class one hundred eighty-two (2026-09-27): under the owner's standing
 instruction of 2026-09-25 ("whenever you see anything that can be translated
 better do it"), 柜门炸开, the closet door blown open, joins the community
 glossary beside 炸柜. One page shipped a literal figure that also turned the
 source's cause (因为) into a repeated event, while the glossary's 炸柜 entry,
 which says outed, never matched the spread-out spelling.

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
