/**
 Guards the glossary audit of 2026-09-27 (owner, on class one hundred
 eighty-three: "'kigurumi的记忆结束' - this isn't really a dictionary keyword
 though?", then "Also check if other items in the glossary have the same
 problems and fix them too."). The rendering glossary holds dictionary terms:
 words, set phrases, names and the community's vocabulary. Entries keyed on a
 fragment of one sentence (a construction, a pronoun, a clause's grammar) came
 out, and the lessons they carried became general house rules on every sheet:
 idiomatic English over the Chinese construction, grammatical English, a
 credit's maker named with "by", and a game's jargon in that game's English.
 Words kept in the glossary no longer refuse forms that are the right English
 for the same word elsewhere (交往 of a romance, 喘不过气 after a run).

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
