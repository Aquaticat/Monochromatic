//region Ballot irregularity log
// Ledger L12: the panel and checker stages fold each ballot's irregularities
// (a duplicated verdict, a number outside the sheet, an unknown vote) into
// their findings, so the artifact records them, and logged none; the audit
// counted 10, 14 and 26 on three runs' artifacts and none in their logs. The
// finding strings name no model, so this line is the one place that says whose
// ballot it was.

/**
 Logs every irregularity a stage found in its resolved ballots, one line per
 finding, naming the stage and the model that cast the ballot.

 @param ballots - resolved ballots keyed by the model that cast each

 @param stage - stage the ballots were cast in, as its lines name it

 @param l - stage logger, which carries the slice

 @example
 ```ts
 logBallotIrregularities({ ballots, stage: 'checker', l, },);
 ```
