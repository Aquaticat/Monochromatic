/**
 Tests for reading a picture without a model: counting what OCR yields, and
 every path of `readImageWithOcr`, which decodes a picture with one program
 and reads it with another.

 WHAT THIS PINS. `solidCharacters` is the count `readImageWithOcr` compares
 against `MIN_READING_CHARS` to decide `read` from `no-text`, so every shape
 of whitespace the raw reading might carry has to be discounted the same
 way, whether that is plain padding or the tabs and newlines a `.txt` file
 can carry. `readImageWithOcr` is pinned whole: which programs it runs, in
 which order and with which arguments, what it hands back, and every line
 it logs, for a picture the first decoder takes, one only the fallback
 takes, one neither takes, a reader that is not installed, a reader that
 fails, a reader that leaves nothing, and readings on each side of the
 floor.

 NO DECODER AND NO OCR READER RUNS HERE. `readImageWithOcr` takes the
 function that runs a program as a required parameter, and every case about
 it hands in `scriptedPrograms` (`scripted-programs.test-fixture.ts`), which
 starts no process. Its stand-ins do real file work at the paths the reader
 gives them, inside the scratch directory the reader makes for itself: the
 stand-in decoder copies its input to its output and the stand-in OCR reader
 writes its input out as text. So the bytes a case hands in as a picture are
 the words it reads back, and they come back only when the picture was
 written, decoded and read at the paths the programs were given. The scratch
 directory's own path is random, so it is read off the first run and shown
 as `<scratch>` in the runs and lines a case compares.

 THE ONE GROUP THAT STARTS A PROCESS is `runInstalledProgram`'s, the runner a
 run hands in. It starts Node itself (`process.execPath`), the program
 running this file and so never absent, and a path in a throwaway directory
 where no program stands. Those cases hold the two rejections the stand-ins
 raise against the ones Node raises, field for field.

 WHAT THE REAL TOOLS MAKE OF A REAL PICTURE IS NOT EXERCISED HERE. That
 depends on `tesseract` actually transcribing a picture, which needs its
 `chi_sim` language data installed, and a unit test must not depend on that.
 It was verified at the user boundary, through the built artifact, on

 `extensionOf`, which names the scratch copy's extension, has its cases in
 `image-asset.unit.test.ts`.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
