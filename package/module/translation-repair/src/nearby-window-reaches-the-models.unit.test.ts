/**
 * Tests that `#107`'s neighbouring window actually REACHES the three repair-lane
 * sheets, and that a slice with no neighbours is asked exactly what it was asked
 * before the window existed.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS SEPARATELY from each builder's own tests. The window is
 * threaded through five call sites as an optional property spread into an object
 * literal, and TypeScript does not excess-property-check a spread. A stage that
 * silently dropped the parameter would compile, lint and pass every existing
 * test while sending the models exactly the sheet they got before. The failure
 * mode is a change that looks landed and does nothing, so the assertion has to
 * be made against the rendered text.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention mirroring corpus structure only.
