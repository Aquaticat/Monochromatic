/**
 Tests for the shell that buys a pairing and hands it to preparation.
 
 WHAT THESE PIN is the two things a settled entry now keeps about its pairing:
 the correspondences themselves, echoed back out of the map preparation
 consumed, and how many voices stood behind them, which was logged and never
 recorded. A section two voices paired and one six voices paired are different
 evidence about the same slicing.
 
 THE VOICE COUNT CARRIES ITS SECTION. The stage is asked one section at a time
 and cannot say which, so counts filed from there would arrive as a run of
 identical-shaped lines naming no section at all.
 
 Fixtures are cat-themed invention mirroring corpus structure only.
