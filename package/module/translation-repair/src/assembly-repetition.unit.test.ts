 * region against itself, so `lintong`'s duplicated farewell was invisible to it
 * at any setting. The duplication lives in no single region, only in the
 * assembled document. This check reads the whole document against the archive
 * the artifact now stores, which needs no model, no roster and no quota.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention mirroring corpus structure only.
