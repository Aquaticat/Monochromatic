// What Charm Hyper serves, and the two ways it differs from the other provider
// at the request layer.
//
// EVERY FIELD HERE WAS MEASURED against the live API on 2026-08-24 rather than
// read off a docs page, because two of them contradict what the catalog
// endpoint alone would suggest.
//
// WHY THIS PROVIDER EXISTS IN THE PIPELINE AT ALL. A corpus pass exhausted the
// other provider's weekly credit and 866 of 875 lost voices carried
// `HTTP 429: You've exceeded your subscription rate limits`. A second provider
// is the only remedy that works against an exhausted budget: retrying it never
// succeeds, and refusing to settle turns a budget problem into holes in the
// deliverable.
//
// SCHEMA'D OUTPUT ONLY WORKS OVER ANTHROPIC MESSAGES HERE. The OpenAI Chat
// Completions endpoint accepts `response_format` and ignores it: a deliberately
// invalid `{type: 'not_a_real_mode_xyz'}` returns 200, an unknown top-level
// field returns 200, and every mode answers with markdown-fenced JSON carrying
// invented keys. Nothing in this file supports that endpoint.
