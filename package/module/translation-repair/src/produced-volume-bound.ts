//region Produced volume bound
// How many characters one producing call may emit for a slice of a given size,
// so a generation that has stopped saying anything new is cut while it is still
// running rather than paid for in full and discarded afterwards.
//
// RELATIVE TO THE SOURCE, which is the whole point. The absolute bound in
// `stream-runaway-watch.ts` is 32000, and the emission that opened this was
// 10381 characters against a 56-character source: comfortably legal by volume
// and 185 times the size of the passage it was translating. No absolute number
// separates a long legitimate passage from a short line that ran away, because
// the two differ in ratio and not in size.
//
// WHY THE REPETITION DETECTORS DO NOT COVER THIS. Both are gated behind 131072
// characters, and this emission was 10381. Even with that bar removed they
// would miss it: the ratio detector samples 64-character windows on a
// 32-character grid, the duplication's period was 5053, and a period that is
// not a multiple of the stride never lands on the same grid offsets twice. The
// measured distinct share was 1.0000 on the grid against 0.5184 at every
// offset. This bound does not look at what the text says, only at how much of
// it there is, which is why phase cannot hide from it.
//
// TWO CALLERS, COUNTING DIFFERENT MATERIAL. Producing a slice counts the slice.
// The re-ask that sends an invalid candidate back to its author counts the
// slice PLUS the findings it must answer, because the repair wire carries an
// `explanation` field the report wire does not, and no source length bounds
// prose about faults. Reusing the producing bound there would refuse correct
// work: re-asked slices are short, median 111 code points across 96 of 175
// measured slices, and 23 of them sit below the floor crossover.
//
// THE RATIO IS MEASURED; THE MATERIAL IT APPLIES TO IS REASONED. Explanation
// length is recorded nowhere, so unlike the ratio the widening was not derived
// from emissions. Three things bound the risk of having reasoned it. It only
// ever LOOSENS, so it adds no refusal the producing path does not already make.
// The widened bound still lands far below the 10381-character emission that
// opened this. And a false refusal costs one candidate, after which the slice
// falls back to its other voices and to the incumbent, which is where an
// invalid candidate went before the re-ask existed at all.
//
// THE PRIOR TRANSLATION IS DELIBERATELY NOT COUNTED, though the re-ask does
// send it. It is itself bounded at sixteen times the source, so counting it
// would permit roughly 272 times the source and clear the 98.2 floor of every
// runaway ever observed here. Detection would be gone.

 * shipped emissions, moving this between 512 and 2048 changes how many are

 * away from text too short to reason about proportionally.

 * MEASURED, over 947 candidate emissions in every settled run. The median holds
 * between 2.95 and 3.75 in every source-length bucket, so a correct translation
 * is about three times its Chinese source whatever its length. Taking the
 * legitimate maximum as the largest ratio the judges actually SELECTED, since a
 * candidate that lost is no evidence of a legitimate size, six shipped runaways
 * sit between 98.2 and 270.0 and the next shipped emission is 9.4. Every
 * setting from twelve to twenty-four cuts exactly those six.
 *
 * SIXTEEN because the codebase already carries sixteen for the sibling
 * incumbent-to-source ratio in `translate-alignment.ts`, so the pipeline holds
 * one number rather than two that mean nearly the same thing.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY LOOSER THAN THE SETTLED ENDPOINT of ten in
 * `slice-implausible.ts`. That one judges text already
 * finished and can afford to be strict; this one ends a call that might still
 * have recovered, so it must be the more forgiving of the two.
