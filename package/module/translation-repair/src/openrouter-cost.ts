// WHAT ONE CALL COST IN USD, read off the wire rather than priced from a table.
//
// OpenRouter's final streamed chunk carries a `usage` block with `cost`, the
// USD the account was charged for that call, beside the token counts
// (captured 2026-09-03: `"usage":{...,"cost":0.000126255304,...}`). A price
// table would have to be re-read whenever an upstream's rate moved, and this
// provider routes each call to one of many upstreams at different rates, so
// the table would be wrong per call rather than per day. The wire figure is
// the source; the public listing's rates are only for planning.
//
// SCANNED SEPARATELY FROM THE COMPLETION READER, which is shared with
// Synthetic and reports only token counts. Adding a provider-specific field
// to `ExtractedCompletion` would make every other reader carry a value it
// cannot fill. The chunk walk itself lives in `openrouter-chunk-scan.ts`,
// shared with the endpoint reader.
