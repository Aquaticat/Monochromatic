// so its last line can be half-written, and a reader that silently skipped
// malformed lines would report a smaller corpus without saying so. Every line
// carrying the marker is either a row or a named refusal.

// index scan and two splits express directly, in one linear pass over each line.

 `Number(raw)` and asked whether that was an integer, and `Number` also reads
 an empty text as 0, `0x1F` as 31, `1e3` as 1000 and a leading sign, so a
 field nobody wrote as a count became one (ledger B71). A digit run past the
 largest integer a double holds exactly is refused too, since it would read as
 a neighbouring number. The rule is the package's one count rule
