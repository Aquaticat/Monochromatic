//region Displacement ratio
// Size primitives the displacement classifier reads: per-slice ratios, a
// document's own expansion, and the corpus expansion to fall back on.
//
// WHY SIZE IS WORTH READING AT ALL. Every judge in the translate lane sees one
// slice pair and nothing else. Where a translator carried a passage into a
// neighbouring section, the archive looks like it invented content on one slice
// and dropped content on the next, and a per-slice roster condemns it at both
// ends while preferring a fresh rendering that says only what its own slice's
// original says. Found on `Dethelly/0` by `#84`'s alteration arm and confirmed
// by hand: the English `Description` carries four sentences whose Chinese sits
// in the NEXT slice.
//
// THE CENTRE HAS BEEN A MEDIAN, THEN A POOLED AGGREGATE, AND IS A MEDIAN AGAIN.
// All three readings are recorded here because the second one was right about
// the case that beat the first, and wrong to conclude the statistic was the
// problem.
//
// The FIRST version took a median over EVERY slice, and it was contaminated by
// the thing it exists to detect: `shi_Yumiaoya` carries three untranslated
// sections whose near-zero ratios pulled its median to 0.76, which dropped the
// threshold to 1.51, which then flagged two perfectly ordinary translations.
//
// The SECOND version replaced it with a pooled aggregate over slices believed
// translated. That fixed `shi_Yumiaoya`, but the fix was the ELIGIBILITY FILTER,
// not the pooling, and nothing checked which of the two had done the work.
// Pooling brought its own exposure: a pooled ratio is decided by the longest
// slices, so one long contaminated slice moves it while a hundred short clean
// ones do not.
//
// The THIRD version, `#163`, measured them against each other over the 89
// documents that offer a baseline. Removing the implausible slices moves a
// pooled centre in 7 more documents than it moves a median, and flips 7 onto the
// corpus reference where a median flips 2. `shi_Yumiaoya` was re-read under both
// and falls back to the corpus reference under each, because the eligibility
// filter removes its untranslated sections before either estimator sees them.
// So the median returned, over a filtered set rather than every slice, and the
// filter that made it safe is the one the second version had already added.
//
// THE AGGREGATE IS NOT FULLY INVARIANT UNDER RELOCATION EITHER, and an earlier
// version of this comment claimed it was. A total over ALL slices would be:
// moving text between slices leaves both document totals alone. The aggregate
// this file computes is taken over ELIGIBLE slices, and relocation can move text
// across that boundary. `Dethelly` is the case: its 35-character recipient is
// excluded by the length floor while its 129-character donor is included, so the
// baseline is lower than it would otherwise be. Measured, the ratio of deficit to
// surplus reads 0.41 under this baseline, 0.44 leaving the pair out, and 0.51
// over all slices. THE CONCLUSION SURVIVES ALL THREE, since the deficit is the
// smaller side under every one, but the estimator is endogenous and the honest
// fix is a baseline computed per adjacency with that pair excluded. Recorded on
// `#432` with those measurements rather than changed at the same time as the
// numbers that depend on it.

 * a pooled centre in 7 more documents than it moves this one, and flips 2 onto
 * the corpus reference where the pooled centre flips 7. Half the sensitivity to
 * the contamination it exists to survive.
 *
 * A MEDIAN WAS TRIED FIRST AND REJECTED, and the region comment still records
 * why: `shi_Yumiaoya`'s untranslated sections pulled a median to 0.76. That
 * median was taken over EVERY slice. This one is taken over what the caller
 * passes, and the caller now passes neither the untranslated sections nor the
 * implausible ones, so the case that refuted it no longer reaches it: measured,
 * that document falls back to the corpus reference under both estimators.
 *
 * NO MINIMUM SLICE COUNT, which was proposed and then refuted. Split-half
 * stability was read at every count, and a document's own centre beat the
 * corpus reference at all of them, including one.
 *
 * IT IS NOT INVARIANT UNDER RELOCATION, and neither was the aggregate it
 * replaces. Moving text between two slices changes both their ratios, so it
