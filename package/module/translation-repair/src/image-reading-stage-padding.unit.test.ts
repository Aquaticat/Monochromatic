/**
 Guards the padded reading of Xu_Yushu1 (2026-09-26): a reader answered a
 handwritten picture with 27 solid characters followed by about 2,700
 ideographic spaces. The sense rule judged the trimmed text, but the stage
 logged "2753 characters" and handed the padded text on, so the log counted
 padding as a transcript and every later comparison carried it. A usable
 reading leaves the stage trimmed, the same as a short one.

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
