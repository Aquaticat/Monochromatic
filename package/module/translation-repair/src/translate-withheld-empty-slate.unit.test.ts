/**
 Guards ledger B39: a slice the archive translates, whose wording the
 deterministic floor refuses, reaches the translate stage as an absent
 incumbent. Where every translator was heard and none proposed wording the
 floor accepts, the slate was empty in both rounds, the judge raised
 `no-candidate`, and the slice attempt rethrew it for a content slice, so the
 entry stopped. The owner's rule is to keep the archive at such a slice and
 ship (2026-09-27, "No valid wording"; "Preference + polish"), so the
 follow-up round keeps the archive's wording and names why. A slate where
 nobody was heard still interrupts the entry: that is the hour, not the
 passage.

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
