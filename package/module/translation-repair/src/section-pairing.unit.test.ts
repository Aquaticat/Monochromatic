/**
 * Tests for ordering a pairing map into the shape that gets written down.
 *
 * WHAT THESE PIN is that the recorded order is SORTED rather than inherited.
 * Insertion order happens to be section order today, because the shell walks
 * aligned sections in order, so a test that only fed an already-ordered map
 * would pass against a function that did no sorting at all.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
