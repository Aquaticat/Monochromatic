// LEDGER X22 (2026-09-29): the site compiles every page with remark-math, so
// text between dollar signs is a formula there, and the strict parse now reads
// it the same way (`parse-mdx.ts`). A translate candidate in XingZ616 set a
// TeX command between dollar signs where the original has no formula, and
// nothing refused it; two dollar amounts in one paragraph form a formula the
// same way. A candidate forming more formulas than its original is refused
// before any judge reads it. Comments are cut first, as the site turns them
// into JSX comments that hold nothing it renders. THE FLOOR STANDS ASIDE where
// the strict grammar refuses either text, since what the site would render
// cannot then be read, and a refusal of that grammar is its own finding.
