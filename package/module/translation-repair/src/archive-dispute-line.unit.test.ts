/**
 Tests that a disputed slice's stand-in is never the archive's own wording,
 and that the dispute line says why a stand-in is refused (ledger L12).

 WHY. The line said "the checkers confirmed no repair of it" for every
 refused stand-in, and a slice the assembly withdrew is refused with every
 disputing issue confirmed, so the line misstated it. And eligibility asked
 only that the checkers confirmed every disputing issue resolved, never that
 the repair lane's text differs from the archive's: a patch that won and
 wrote nothing, with its issues confirmed, would stand in with the disputed
 wording itself, and the translate lane would keep it as the incumbent. That
 was never seen (0 of 1,132 fully resolved disputes over every artifact), and
 now cannot happen.

 The refused-wording finding a translate author reads had the same slip: it
 said the checkers did not confirm the repair lane's text of a slice the
 assembly withdrew.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention.
