// CLASS ONE HUNDRED SIXTY (TianqiChen6662, 2026-09-26): a kigurumi performer's
// page shipped 头壳 (the performer's head mask) as "inside her head", the
// wearer's own head, and 阿洛娜 and 亚托莉 as the archive's "Alona and
// Atori"; no candidate on the run wrote the characters' official names, Arona
// of Blue Archive and Atri of ATRI -My Dear Moments-. The archive renders 头壳
// "headpiece" on the same page, so that rendering leads. Kept beside
// `community-glossary.ts`, which spreads these entries into
// `COMMUNITY_GLOSSARY`, so neither file outgrows the line budget. Refused forms
// match in any case at word boundaries (`glossary-match.ts`), and each applies
// only where the source carries its term.

/**
 Fandom words and character names the pinned corpus carries, with the English
