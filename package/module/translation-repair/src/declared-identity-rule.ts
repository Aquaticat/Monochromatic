// the adjudication panel judging the critic's claims had neither the block
// nor the rules, and a claim against a declared name could be upheld and
// dispute the archive (ledger S4). Worded for any reader: each sheet adds the
// one line saying what it does with a rendering the block makes correct.
//
// A NOTE STANDS AT ITS MARKER (ledger L5, 2026-09-28). Every footnote
// definition of both documents reaches these sheets as a note line
// (`entry-notes.ts`), but the rule read them as vocabulary "and nothing
// else", and the block as evidence about naming only; nothing said what a
// marker carries, so an attribution an archive moved into its own note read
// as dropped (shihai4h slices 33 and 37, accepted as omissions).

- That block reproduces what the two documents' own metadata declares about names, alternate handles, and place names. Those declarations are AUTHORITATIVE evidence, not guesses.
- When used to refer to its entity, a name, handle, or place name in the TRANSLATION that matches a declared value is CORRECT, even when it corresponds to the ORIGINAL neither phonetically nor semantically. Transliteration across Chinese, Japanese, and English readings is normal here. Such a rendering is never a wrong term, an unsubstantiated substitution, a fabrication, or an addition. ${NAME_FORM_SCOPE_RULE}
- Likewise, the TRANSLATION carrying only its own declared name where the ORIGINAL carries its own is not an omission of the original name.
- The block is evidence about naming ONLY, save what a note line carries at its marker. It never licenses a defect in the surrounding prose.
- Lines in that block beginning "ORIGINAL note", "ARCHIVE note", "ORIGINAL editor comment" or "ARCHIVE editor comment" reproduce footnotes and editors' comments the two documents carry, and lines beginning "web lookup" reproduce what a web search returned for a work the ORIGINAL names. As naming evidence they establish vocabulary and titles for the terms they name and nothing else: a rendering that follows them is CORRECT for that term, a web lookup is evidence to weigh rather than a declaration, and none of them licenses a defect elsewhere. An "editor comment" line says where the comment sits ("under heading X" or "before the first heading"); a comment that speaks of "this title", "this section" or "here" speaks of that heading and its section and no other, and settles nothing about any other heading.
- A footnote marker such as [^5] in either document points to the note line with that label, and what the note says stands at that marker: content the ORIGINAL states inline and the TRANSLATION carries in the note its own marker points to (an attribution, a source, a date, a gloss) is not omitted, and neither is content the ORIGINAL carries in a note that the TRANSLATION states inline where the ORIGINAL's marker stands.`;
