/**
 * Tests for the floor under a consolidation slate.
 *
 * WHAT THIS PINS is the case the band pair actually hit: every proposal
 * refused by the structural guard, and a consolidation shipping anyway. The
 * floor is what makes that impossible, so the case where nothing survives
 * matters more here than the case where something does.
 *
 * The policy is inherited rather than invented, so these also pin the half
 * that is easy to lose in a refactor: a slate with even one survivor is NOT
 * refused, however many of its siblings failed. A floor that tripped on any
 * invalid proposal would throw away the ensemble.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
