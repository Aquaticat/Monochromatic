/**
 Tests for the floor under a consolidation slate.
 
 WHAT THIS PINS is the case the band pair actually hit: every proposal
 refused by the structural guard, and a consolidation shipping anyway. The
 floor is what makes that impossible, so the case where nothing survives
 matters more here than the case where something does.
 
 The policy is inherited rather than invented, so these also pin the half
 that is easy to lose in a refactor: a slate with even one survivor is NOT
 refused, however many of its siblings failed. A floor that tripped on any
 invalid proposal would throw away the ensemble.
 
 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
