// Corpus pages compile as MDX upstream (@mdx-js/mdx with a Vue pragma), so this module
// parses with the same grammar family. GFM is enabled here even though upstream omits
// it: footnote reference/definition nodes carry the semantic graph this library
// validates, while emitted repairs preserve the literal textual convention.
//
// LEDGER X22 (2026-09-29): the site also compiles with remark-math
// (one-among-us/data scripts/mdx.ts), so text between dollar signs is a
// formula there, and the strict parse reads it the same way. Over the 92
// sources and archives at the pin and 273 settled pages, adding it changed no
// tree. The tolerant fallback stays without it: with no MDX grammar, the
// template strings inside JSX attributes (`'${...}'`) read as prose there, and
// math would pair their dollar signs in 171 of those 457 inputs.
