// Where in a document one claimed defect actually is, as an interval rather
// than as a string.
//
// TWO SPANS, NOT ONE, and the difference is what the first version of this got
// wrong. A quote does three jobs at once: it FINDS the text, it names the
// smallest wording that CHANGED, and it decides whether two voices are talking
// about the same defect. One string cannot do all three. Asking for a locator
// and a focus separates them, and the third job then falls to the focus
// interval, which is a fact about the document rather than about the auditor's
// typing habits.
//
// THE FLOOR IS GONE, and its absence is the point. A minimum length was meant
// to stop a quote that identifies nothing, but a short quote occurring exactly
// once identifies a span perfectly, and the floor's real effect was to force
// every voice to PAD: `not`, `three` and a three-character Chinese negation all
// failed it. Padding is what made two different defects in one sentence arrive
// as the same quote, so the rule written to prevent unfounded evidence was
// manufacturing false agreement. Uniqueness does the whole job the floor was
// reaching for, and does it without touching what a voice may point at.
//
// A FOCUS NEED ONLY BE UNIQUE INSIDE ITS LOCATOR, which is what lets a voice
// name a repeated negator: the locator says which sentence, the focus says
// which word of it, and neither has to be unique in the document alone.
