/**
 * Tests that the stages deciding what SHIPS are told what this corpus is
 * written under.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Every producing sheet splices `HOUSE_POLICY_BLOCK`, and
 * for a long time no judging sheet did. The judges were therefore the only
 * stages that had never been told about reader protection, while criterion one
 * asks them for every proposition of the original with nothing left out. A
 * candidate keeping a suicide method vague, exactly as the corpus's own rule
 * demands, reads as an omission to a judge with only the numbered list.
 *
 * AND THE TENSE HALF, which was measured rather than imagined. Of the four
 * slates a judge refused ENTIRELY on the consolidation bed, three were refused
 * over tense, one saying every candidate had altered the time reference by
 * rendering a tenseless Chinese copula in the past. The rule that answers that
 * lived in the critic's sheet and reached no judge.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention.
