/**
 Tests for which translation blocks a pairing declined.

 WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Grouping and the coverage assertion both ask this
 question, and they must derive the same answer from the same inputs, since a
 disagreement between them reads as a coverage fault at a place neither one
 caused. The answer is built by turning the pairing into alignment steps,
 which needs to be told HOW MANY blocks each side has.

 WHAT WAS MEASURED. On 2026-08-25, swapping those two counts failed no test
 in this package. A swap is silent in the common case, because most pairs
 carry equal counts, and it only shows itself where the two sides differ:
 exactly the entries the pairing exists for.

 THE FIXTURE THEREFORE MAKES THEM DIFFER, two originals against three
 translation blocks. Under the counts as passed, the third translation block
 is declined; under the swap, the walk stops one block early and reports
 nothing declined at all, which would hand grouping a block no slice covers
 while telling the coverage assertion everything was accounted for.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
