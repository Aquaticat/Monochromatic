//region Artifact repair reading
// Reads one issue record's repair provenance back out of a run artifact.
//
// The one tolerance here is deliberate and narrow: an artifact written before
// repair recording existed carries no `repairDisposition`, and that absence
// returns `undefined` rather than throwing. Round two's thirty-one artifacts
// are exactly that, and they are the calibration set, so refusing to read them
// would trade a measurement for a schema opinion.
//
// The tolerance stops at absence. A record that DOES claim a disposition is
// parsed strictly, because a half-written repair is a malformed measurement and
// reading it leniently is how a repair denominator quietly goes wrong. Absence
// and emptiness stay distinct all the way to the sheet: no disposition means
// repair quality is unknowable for this item, while a disposition of
// `no-region` means the run measured that no targeted repair exists.
