//region Credential mask
// Replaces every copy of a credential a request carried inside the text a
// provider answered with, so the credential never leaves the transport.
//
// WHY AT THE TRANSPORT. A provider may echo a sent credential in a reply body,
// an authentication failure's body being the plausible place, and everything
// above the transport reads that body: the status failure's message and
// excerpt, the raw reply preview a probe prints, a malformed-completion
// message, a cached reply. One mask where the body is assembled closes all of
// them at once.
//
// NO REGULAR EXPRESSION IS BUILT FROM A CREDENTIAL. A key may hold characters a
// pattern reads as syntax, and building the pattern from it is the shape that
// fails on exactly the keys that need masking. Every spelling of every
// credential is found in one pass over the text (`credential-search.ts`), so a
// long body costs its length and the number of copies, never its length times
// the number of spellings.
//
// A CREDENTIAL IS MASKED IN EVERY SPELLING A MECHANICAL DECODER RECOVERS: as it
// stands, as a JSON string writes it (`credential-needles.ts`), percent-encoded
// or JSON-escaped in any mix and nesting (`credential-views.ts`, which reads the
// text as each decoder would and maps a find back to where it stands), and in
// base64 or base64url at any alignment (`credential-needles.ts`). A header sent
// encoded and echoed decoded is listed by `credentialsOfHeaders`
// (`credential-decoded-forms.ts`). Out of reach by rule: a credential a proxy
// split by a line fold or a soft hyphen, and a spelling that no decoder named
// here recovers (a cipher, a hash, a case-folded key, the key written in hex or
// as HTML entities, or in base64 of bytes that are no UTF-8 of it).
//
// THE CLOSED LIST OF CREDENTIAL HEADERS is the one place a new client's
// credential header must be written down: a header named here has its value
// masked, a header not named here is taken for no credential (`content-type`
// and `anthropic-version` are values every reply would otherwise be rewritten
// by).
