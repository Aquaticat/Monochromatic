//region Task runner guard
// A BUILT COMMAND OF THIS PACKAGE REFUSES TO RUN IN A PROCESS THAT HOLDS
// PROVIDER KEYS UNLESS THAT PROCESS NAMES THE COMMAND AS THE ONE IT MEANS TO
// START. Twice in one day an agent started a built command by hand from a
// shell that held the operator's real keys, and one of those starts bought
// model calls before it was stopped. A rule written for agents is not a guard,
// so the command itself refuses.
//
// WHAT COUNTS AS A KEY: a variable whose name ends in `_API_KEY` (the same
// name test the child environments use, `isCredentialName`) and whose value is
// not empty. A name that merely contains `_API_KEY` elsewhere is no key, and a
// variable that is absent or empty is none either, so a process that holds no
// key runs as it always did, marker or no marker.
//
// WHAT NAMES THE COMMAND: the variable `TRANSLATION_REPAIR_STARTED_BY`, set to
// the command's own name. The task of each command sets it (`mise.toml`), the
// test world's one child fixture sets it for the command it starts, and an
// operator who must start a built file without its task sets it by hand for
// that one start: every task builds the package first, and nothing may rebuild
// while a pass is running (`doc/runbook/translation-repair-corpus-pass.md`).
// A marker naming another command does not start this one.
//
// WHAT THE GUARD IS FOR, AND WHAT IT IS NOT: it stops the start nobody meant,
// a command run by hand from a shell that happens to hold keys. It is no
// access control. Whoever can set a variable can set this one, and setting it
// is the statement the guard asks for.
//
// PURE: the environment and the command's name come in, a verdict goes out.
// What only a real process has, its environment, is handed in by the entry
// file through `reportingRefusals`, which turns a refusal into the stated
// refusal every entry already ends in (exit 6).
