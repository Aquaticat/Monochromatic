// Who won each slice, and whether the document kept it.
//
// WHY A COUNT WAS NOT ENOUGH. The lane already reported how many slices changed
// and which indices shipped, and neither says who the text came from or how the
// judges got there. Every question anyone has asked of this lane since is per
// slice and per producer: how often the archive's English was kept, whether a
// producer favours its own rendering, whether ballot position moves a verdict.
// `#83` asked for this, and `#84` could only answer its half on a bench because
// no settled artifact carries it.
//
// TWO FACTS THAT COME APART, and keeping them apart is the point. "The incumbent
// won selection" is a decision the judges made. "The incumbent shipped
// unchanged" is what the document ended up carrying, and the assembly guard can
// withdraw a replacement the judges chose. A reader with one number cannot tell
// a slice the archive won from a slice where it lost and was reinstated.

   * measurements need exactly that. `selfPreference` reads it as-is, which is
   * why it is this shape: the artifact carries what the instrument consumes
   * rather than something a reader has to reshape.
   *
   * THE REASONS ARE PART OF IT and are the bulk of the bytes. They earn it: the
   * Kimi-K3 channel-marker defect and the `Dethelly` relocation were both found
   * by reading what judges said rather than what they chose, and neither is
   * recoverable from a tally.
   *
   * POSITION IS HERE TOO, without a field for it. `producers` is in slate
   * order and a ballot names a one-based position into it, so a ballot's
   * position and the candidate it fell on are both readable, which is what a
   * position-bias measurement needs.
