// WHAT MAKES TWO RUNS' PICTURE READINGS THE SAME READING, for cache purposes.
//
// A READING IS NOT DETERMINISTIC and that is the whole reason this exists. Ask
// the same model the same question about the same picture twice and the wording
// differs, so a slice cache key carrying raw reading text would change on every
// run, every picture-bearing slice would miss, and resuming a document would
// re-buy all of its translation work. The reading is stored under a key derived
// from its INPUTS, and the slice key names that key rather than the text.
//
// WHAT AN INPUT IS HERE. The picture's bytes, who was asked, what they were
// asked, and the bar their answers had to clear. Change any of those and a
// stored reading answers a different question; change none and it answers this
// one however differently it is worded.
