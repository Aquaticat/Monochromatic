// A REPLACEMENT MAY NOT LEAVE THE DOCUMENT WITH FEWER QUOTED PASSAGES THAN THE
// ARCHIVE HAD.
//
// WHY THIS QUESTION RATHER THAN THE OTHER ONE. The harm is that a lane writing
// from the source alone deletes English the source cannot account for, and the
// obvious response is to work out which passages those are. That turns out not
// to be decidable cheaply: translation changes bytes by construction, so no
// exact match distinguishes an unpaired passage from an ordinary translated
// one, and deciding it properly is what the aligner already does. Measured
// against the nine transcripts known in the corpus, a structural rule anchored
// on shared markup reaches two of them, and fails three separate ways on the
// rest.
//
// DELETION, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS DECIDABLE FROM THE TWO TEXTS ALONE. Measured
// over both settled pools on 2026-08-18:
//
//   flagged pool   4 of 64 shipped replacements drop a whole quote block
//                  all four in the translate lane
//   natural pool   0 of 69
//
// Four hits, every one a passage a reader would want back, and no false
// positive in sixty-nine natural rows.
//
// THE COUNTER-CASE THAT KEEPS THIS HONEST. Deleting is not always wrong: on one
// entry the repair lane removed a paragraph of translator invention with nine
// separate accepted findings against it, and that was correct. It was not a
// blockquote, so this guard would not have stopped it. The guard is deliberately
// narrow for that reason: it protects the shape transcripts and quoted letters
// take, and says nothing about prose.
//
// THE COUNT IS THE PARSER'S (ledger B42, 2026-09-30). It was the number of
// blank-line-separated chunks opening with `>`, which the parser and the floor
// disagree with: a quote opening on the line after a paragraph's is a
// blockquote to both and was none to the count, so a replacement keeping every
// quote was refused, as the stored record of hulicaijia24 slice 2 was; a quote
// inside a container tag, which the floor's top-level block list does not
// reach, was none either. Both texts are now read as the floor reads a page,
// the strict grammar first and plain markdown where it refuses, and a text
// neither grammar reads keeps the archive, since a check that could not run
// has not shown the quotes survive.
