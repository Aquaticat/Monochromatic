//region Provider router re-ask
// A NON-CONFORMANT ANSWER IS RE-ASKED ON ANOTHER PROVIDER THAT SERVES THE MODEL.
//
// Why this is worth a second call rather than a retry: the providers extract
// structure by genuinely different mechanisms, a forced tool on one and a
// `response_format` on the others, so the same weights can conform on one
// serving stack and not on another.
//
// IT IS NOT A BUDGET FAILOVER and does not pretend to be one. A bad answer
// marks nobody as refusing. The re-ask is skipped where no other provider
// serves the model, which is the `#88` invalid-candidate path the policy
// names, and skipped where every other provider is dry. When the second stack
// disagrees with the schema too, the FIRST provider's answer is returned,
// because the caller's own handling is written against it; both are logged.
//
// NUDGED, AND DRIVEN FROM ABOVE THE ROUTER IN A RUN (ledger P9): the re-ask
// carries `CROSS_PROVIDER_NUDGE` so it is a new prompt the uniqueness wrapper
// may buy, and that wrapper performs it through `chatText` hinted with
// `otherThan`, which `routedTextElsewhere` serves (`nudged-reask.ts`).
//
// SPLIT FROM `provider-router.ts` at its line budget. The router lends it the
// three things it needs: the reach of a request, the budget view, and the
// dispatch that performs one call on one provider.
