/**
 Tests for which lane texts a consolidation slate offers (class forty,
 2026-09-17).

 WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The consolidation is the retry of a declined contest,
 and on Mio24 slice 17 the retry never saw the two texts the contest was
 about: the archive's one-line rendering stood, the deterministic rule
 withheld it, and the slate carried only the writers' fresh proposals. The
 lane texts join the slate exactly when the standing is not a text the
 contest endorsed and the rule admits, each only when it passes the rule
 itself and differs from the standing.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
