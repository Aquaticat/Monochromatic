/**
 Tests that one editor's edit nested too deeply to read costs the repair chunk
 that edit and nothing else.

 THE SHAPE UNDER TEST. An editor's edit is text from one voice. The apply gate
 checked what the edit kept and what it quoted but never whether any grammar
 reads the text it produces, so an edit of hundreds of nested list markers was
 applied, judged and checked, and then the parse that settles the chunk raised
 the plain grammar's refusal out of the whole chunk. Each case here has two
 editors write the same region, one of them the deep edit.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
