//region Translator answer fold
// A TRANSLATOR'S ANSWER AS IT SHIPS, folded where a lane first holds it and
// before anything reads it (ledger B112).
//
// The translate and consolidation lanes used to fold only when building the
// slate, after the publication rule, the repair turn and the floor had read
// the answer as the model wrote it. A line holding only a no-break space is no
// blank line to the page parser, so a two-paragraph answer passed against a
// one-paragraph page as one paragraph and shipped as two; a disputed wording
// written with U+2011 for its hyphen was not that wording until folded. The
// repair lane folds at its wire readers (`edit-wire.ts`, `refine-wire.ts`);
// this is the same rule for the two lanes that read `TranslateReportWire`.
//
// THREE INTAKES CALL IT: the translate gather (`translate-produce.ts`), the
// consolidation gather (`consolidate-produce.ts`) and an author's revision in
// the repair turn (`translate-repair.ts`). `buildTranslateCandidates` folds
// nothing and refuses a voice that arrives unfolded.
