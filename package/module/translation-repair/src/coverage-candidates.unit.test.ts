/**
 * Tests for listing every passage a pairing covers with nothing.
 *
 * WHAT THESE PIN is that both scales answer one question. A source section the
 * matcher paired with nothing and a source block inside a paired section that
 * the aligner paired with nothing are the same finding at two sizes, and the
 * coverage stage asks about both. A lister that reported only one would leave
 * the other class of passage unasked about, which reads as a translation that
 * covers everything.
 *
 * THE POSITIVE CONTROL COMES FIRST, because every case here is a list and an
 * empty list satisfies the ones that expect nothing. The first case pins that
 * this lister does report something, so the empty answers mean what they say.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
