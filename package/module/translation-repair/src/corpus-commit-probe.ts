/**
 Asks the clone whether it holds the pinned commit, after a read of it failed.

 WHY A SECOND GIT CALL: git words a path absent at a held commit and a full
 hash the clone lacks the same (`does not exist in`), so the failed read's own
 text cannot say which it was. `rev-parse --verify --quiet` answers with its
 exit status, which no message language changes: 0 for a commit the clone
 holds, 1 when the clone answered and the revision names no commit in it, and
 128 when git died, all MEASURED against git 2.55. Git dies both where it
 cannot open the clone (a missing directory, a directory that is no
 repository's top, which git meets as no repository since it searches no
 higher than the clone) and in a clone it opened, on a commit object it
 cannot inflate, so a 128 is read by asking the clone for its git directory
 (`probeGitDir`). A child with no exit status (a signal, a spawn the system
 refused) or another status answered nothing, and what it failed with is
 kept, so the refusal says why it is `other`.
 It runs only after a read failed, so a walk pays one more git call per page
 it does not find.

 A FAILURE THAT IS NO SUBPROCESS FAILURE IS NEVER READ AS AN ANSWER: nano-spawn
 throws raw only while preparing the call (a working directory removed under
 this process, a command part that is no string), which is a fault of this
 process and no fact about the clone, so it propagates, and
 `probeKeepingRead` stops the read with it and the read's own failure.

 @param pin - clone and commit the failed read resolved against, the same the
 probe asks about so its answer is about the read that failed

 @param gitPath - git binary the failed read ran, so the probe is answered by
 the same git

 @returns Answer the exit status gave, or that none came and the failures
 that left the probe without one; a probe that ends any way but exit status
 0, 1 or 128 is never read as the commit being held or absent

 @throws Whatever nano-spawn's preparation of either call throws, unchanged

 const probe = await probeCommit({ pin, gitPath, },);
