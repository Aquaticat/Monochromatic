/**
 Tests for the grading sheet a human grades a drawn sample on: the source
 line of a candidate that anchors no quote says why it has none, since a
 claim anchored at an empty insertion point and a claim anchored at nothing
 ask a grader for different things.

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
