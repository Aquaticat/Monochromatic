//region Chunk candidate measurement
// Everything deterministic that selection ranks a patched chunk by, gathered in
// one place so the chunk runner stays a sequence of stages rather than a stage
// with arithmetic in it.
//
// Two of these measure less than their original names promised, and both now
// carry names that say what they actually count. `regressedKnownIssues` can only
// see EXISTING accepted issues the checkers marked worse, so a wholly new defect
// the patch introduces has nowhere to be counted; `touchedRegionChars` sums each
// touched envelope's longer side rather than differing characters, which a
// merged envelope serving several issues makes broad. The BEHAVIOR is unchanged
// on purpose: renaming is honest, while changing what selection ranks by is a
// pipeline decision that needs its own evidence.

/**
 * Accepted issues an applied operation actually served.
 *
 * Selection credit is limited to these. Checkers are asked about EVERY accepted
 * issue, including ones no envelope could be cut for and ones whose envelope
 * received no surviving operation, and a checker reading the patched text can
 * call such an issue fixed. Counting that let a patch touching issue A beat
 * unchanged on credit for issue B that nothing touched, which is not evidence
 * the patch improved anything. Verdicts on unserved issues remain in the
 * tallies as telemetry; they simply stop deciding the selection.
