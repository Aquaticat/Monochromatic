/**
 * Tests for reading one slice into the shape a translation of it has to match.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE IS FOR, and why its branches are worth asking about
 * directly. Structure and references survive a translation and wording does
 * not: 三只猫 becomes "three cats" and no digit is left on either side, so a
 * gate anchored to prose would fire on every correct rendering. What a
 * candidate must still carry is the sequence of blocks and the machine-readable
 * identities inside them, and that is exactly what this reads.
 *
 * THE DETAIL FIELD IS THE PART A KIND CHECK MISSES. Two headings are both
 * `heading` and a level-two turned into a level-three has changed the document;
 * two lists are both `list` and a bulleted turned into a numbered has too. Four
 * cases pin what distinguishes them, and one pins that everything else says
 * nothing rather than inventing a difference.
 *
 * ATOMS ARE FILTERED, NOT COLLECTED. `atomsOfNode` reads seven node types and
 * the walk keeps five kinds, so a case per kind is a case per arm.
 *
 * ONE ARM IS NOT REACHABLE FROM HERE: the rethrow of an error that is not an
 * `MdxParseError`. Every input this function accepts is a string, and the
 * grammar answers a string with either a tree or its own refusal, so reaching
 * the rethrow needs a seam this module does not have. It is left uncovered
 * deliberately rather than by oversight.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
