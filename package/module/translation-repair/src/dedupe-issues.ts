//region Dedupe issues
// One defect reaching the editor as several accepted issues is waste, not
// evidence. Measured over pass13, exact-place duplicates are 13.4% of accepted
// issues, and the human grader independently marked 14% of a 50-item draw as
// duplicates while grading detection. Ratified in
// `doc/decision/translation-repair-duplicate-issue-emission.md`.
//
// MERGED RATHER THAN DROPPED, which is the part that matters. A dropped
// duplicate takes its claim ids with it, and those ids are how attribution
// answers the question that made duplicates interesting in the first place:
// whether a duplicate came from one critic repeating itself or from several
// critics agreeing. The survivor carries every member claim, so collapsing the
// ISSUES does not collapse the proposer record.
//
// The key is category AND span set, never span alone. A shared span is narrow
// but not proof of identity, and two genuinely different complaints about one
// sentence must both survive.
