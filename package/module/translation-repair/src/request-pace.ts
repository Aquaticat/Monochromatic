//region Request pace
// A sliding-window pacer that lets at most `perWindow` requests START in any
// `windowMs`, queueing the rest, so a provider's request-rate limit is met by
// waiting rather than by being refused.
//
// WHY. Hyper limits this account to 1,000 requests in a rolling hour (the
// owner's figure, recorded in `hyper-client.ts`) and refuses the excess with
// HTTP 429 ("You've hit your hourly rate limit. Please try again in 1s").
// Measured on XIEPT2, 2026-09-03 00:55 to 01:39 UTC, Hyper the only provider
// left: 612 successful requests in the whole run (SPEND lines), refusals from
// 01:00:33 UTC once the hour's thousand was spent (257 of them in this run, the
// rest in the run before it), then a trickle of 100 to 140 successes per ten
// minutes, which is the rate at which requests from an hour earlier left the
// window; 6,441 retry attempts and 1,487 calls refused five times over, every
// seat losing about half its calls, and the run ended provider-unavailable. A
// provider-wide hold on the refusal herded every call into one burst; no hold
// at all saturated the window outright. Neither is pacing. This is.
//
// A FIRST READING OF THE SAME LOG counted "completed streams" and reached
// 9,628 successes in 43 minutes; a refused exchange completes its stream too,
// so that count was successes plus refusals. The SPEND lines are the count.
//
// CLASS ONE HUNDRED FORTY-NINE (hulicaijia30, 2026-09-26). The pass spent the
// hour's thousand starts between 07:31 and 08:04 UTC, and at 08:04:20 UTC one take
// slept 1,640,012 ms until the first start left the window. Takes then ran
// through one promise chain and the sleep did not hear an abort, so every Hyper
// call behind it waited too, and the 360 s call deadlines that fired at about
// 08:10 UTC were only read at 08:31:40 UTC, when the sleep ended: eight translate
// slices stalled 27 to 34 minutes and the entry took 100.6 minutes. Each take
// now RESERVES its start at once, in arrival order, and waits for it on its
// own abortable timer: a caller that gives up leaves at once and hands its
// place back. `waitMs` says how long a take would wait, which the router reads
// to send the call to a provider that can start it now.
//
// LIMITS. The window starts empty: requests an earlier process made in the
// last hour are not in it, so a launch right after a heavy run can be refused
// until they leave the window; the retry ladder honours the refusal's own
// wait for that. A place handed back does not move later reservations
// earlier; they start on their own time, which never exceeds the rate.
