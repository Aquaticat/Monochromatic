 text, that text renders every link of the original to it, however often
 either side links it. Where the archive links the href under more than one
 text, the original's links to it pair with the archive's in page order when
 both carry the same count, the rule the signatures and the headings pair
 under. A differing count leaves which text renders which link unreadable, so
 the link is left out rather than given whichever text the archive wrote last.
