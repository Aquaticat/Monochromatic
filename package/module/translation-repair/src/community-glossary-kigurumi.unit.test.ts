/**
 Guards class one hundred eighty-four (2026-09-27): under the
 owner's standing instruction of 2026-09-25 ("whenever you see anything that
 can be translated better do it"), two words of the kigurumi and fan
 community join the fandom glossary. 变娃 (the performers' word for putting on
 the costume and becoming the doll) shipped on one page as a game of becoming
 a doll, and English "doll up" means dressing smartly. 治愈 (the fan sense of
 healing, as in 治愈系) first led with "comforted"; the owner disagreed
 (2026-09-27), since "healing" is the fandom's own English and the archive
 reads "healed", so "healed" leads. The contrast with 安慰 that this guard,
 the entry and the handover once gave the owner was a misquotation: the page
 writes 安抚, never 安慰 (ledger C6).

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
