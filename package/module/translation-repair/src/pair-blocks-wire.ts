// PAIRING IS THE ONE JOB HERE THAT SCORING CANNOT DO.
//
// The deterministic aligner has three signals and this corpus exhausts all
// three: block kind is constant when every block is a paragraph, Chinese and
// English prose share no Latin tokens, and length is a weak tiebreaker even
// once its expansion is estimated per document rather than assumed. Measured on
// `saurikissa`, that reaches four correct pairings in eight and goes no further
// at any length weight.
//
// The errors that remain are one-to-two correspondences, where a translation
// splits a paragraph the original keeps whole. Reading two languages and saying
// which passage renders which is comprehension, and
// `doc/decision/llm-assisted-block-pairing.md` decides it is done by a model.
//
// A REFUSED PAIRING MUST NOT SILENTLY PROCEED, which was already demanded of
// the section aligner: a wrong pairing manufactures issues rather than skipping
// work, so it is worse than no pairing. Everything this file parses is checked
// against the block counts it was built from, and anything that does not hold
// throws rather than being repaired into something plausible.

 Reads a model's pairing, refusing anything that cannot be used as one.

 REFUSES RATHER THAN REPAIRS. A pairing that runs backwards, names a block

 near-miss to be tidied up: it is evidence the model did not do the task, and
 using part of it would put mismatched passages in front of the critics
 exactly as before.

 ONE ORIGINAL MAY APPEAR TWICE, because a translation splitting a paragraph is
 the correspondence this exists to express, and one TRANSLATION block may
 appear twice, because a translation merging two paragraphs is another. The
 same correspondence may not be named twice, adjacent or not, since the
 agreement over voices counts each naming as a vote.
