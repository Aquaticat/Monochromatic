//region Verdict letter reading
// Deciding when a letter a grader typed is a VERDICT and when it merely began a
// word.
//
// Both sheets ask for `Y` or `N` and both invite prose after it, so
// `N. The original does quote this.` is a verdict with a note while
// `Not enough context to grade` is a refusal that happens to start with the
// same letter. The rule that separates them is one character wide: a letter
// counts only when the sheet ends or a delimiter follows it.
//
// Shared rather than copied. The detection reader had this privately and the
// repair reader needs the identical rule; two implementations of "what did the
// human actually say" would drift, and the drift would show up as a silently
// different denominator rather than as a failure.
