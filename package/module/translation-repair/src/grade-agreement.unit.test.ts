/**
 Tests for the refusals `scoreGradeAgreement` makes over a pre-grade file that
 names a sheet position more than once.

 The cases that score and compare whole draws live beside the sheet reader in
 `grade-sheet-read.unit.test.ts`; this file holds the repeated-position
 refusals, which that file's fixtures cannot build because they number
 positions from the array they are handed.

 Fixtures are cat-themed invention.
