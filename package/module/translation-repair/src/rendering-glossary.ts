// CLASS ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-THREE (shi_Yumiaoya23, 2026-09-25). The page
// shipped 师范学院 as "a normal college" and 觉醒了学霸属性 as "awakened her
// top-student trait": word-for-word renderings an English reader stumbles on,
// chosen by judges who had nothing telling them the ordinary English. The
// owner answered on 2026-09-25 that anything which can be translated better
// should be. This glossary holds ordinary Chinese words, not the community's
// own (`community-glossary.ts`), with the English the page uses and the
// calques a candidate may not write. It shares the community glossary's
// machinery: the words an entry's source carries reach every sheet's identity
// context (`renderingTermLines`), and the source-carry floor refuses a
// candidate that keeps one in Han or writes a refused form
// (`translate-source-carry.ts`). An entry is added whenever a read finds a
// rendering that can be better; an official name that carries a word (北京师范
// 大学, "Beijing Normal University") is never entered, only the generic word.
