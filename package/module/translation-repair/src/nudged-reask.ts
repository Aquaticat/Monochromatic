//region Nudged re-ask elsewhere
// LEDGER P9, the owner's ruling of 2026-09-28 ("Enable with the nudge"). A
// reply that could not be used is asked again, once, of the SAME MODEL ON
// ANOTHER PROVIDER, since the providers extract structure by different
// mechanisms (a forced tool on one, a `response_format` on the others) and the
// same weights can conform on one stack and not another. The router's re-ask
// had never run in a pass: `promptUniqueClient` buys every JSON reply through
// `chatText` and reads it itself, so the router's `chatJson` was never called.
//
// NUDGED, SO THE RE-ASK IS A NEW PROMPT. The uniqueness wrapper samples one
// model and prompt once; the same bytes asked again would be the same sample
// by that rule, and would come back from its cache in no time.
//
// A WORDING OF ITS OWN, not either of the stage recovery round's
// (`recovery-nudge.ts`). That round later re-asks every seat still unreadable
// with its nudge on whatever provider the policy picks; sharing a wording
// would make its prompt this re-ask's digest, answered from the claims with
// the reply that already failed, and the round would go silent for exactly
// the seats it exists for.
//
// ONCE, AND NEVER FROM A REPLY NO ROUTER TAGGED: a payload stored before the
// tag existed, or a client that routes nowhere, cannot name a provider to
// avoid, and the recovery round is its second chance.
