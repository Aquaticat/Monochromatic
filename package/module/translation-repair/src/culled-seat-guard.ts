// and nothing stopped a path that named the seat itself: the recall
// benchmark's default judges still listed it, and the router serves it on
// every provider. The run client wraps its routed client in this, so a culled
// model is refused before any provider is asked, with the refusal a round
// already reads as an unreachable seat. Catalog reach stays as it is: the
// card is kept for the catalogs and the unit fixtures.
