// MEASURED ON MIO25'S FIRST ATTEMPT (slice 16, 2026-09-17): two of the four
// translate candidates for the closing poem were the Chinese original
// returned as it stood, one judge chose one of them as "the most faithful
// rendering", the others abstained or split, the select missed its weight
// floor twice, and the entry ended with the translate lane's absence error
// because that slice has no archive translation to fall back on. A candidate
// that repeats a Han-carrying original is not a rendering of it and never
// belongs on a slate.
//
// REPETITION IN ALL BUT WHITESPACE. Exact repetition after trimming the
// ends was the first reading; on XingZ615 (2026-09-19, class sixty-five) a
// consolidation writer returned the closing poem's original with a space
// after each bare quote line, it passed the floor as the slate's only valid
// candidate, three of four judges abstained on "a verbatim copy of the
// Chinese original" and the entry stopped. A copy that differs only in
// whitespace is the original. A slice that carries nothing to translate (a
// bare link, a component) is returned as it stands and must pass; the
// ideograph test is what separates the two.
