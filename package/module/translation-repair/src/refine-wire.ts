// One rewriter call per slice returns zero or more paragraph rewrites, each
// naming a paragraph by its prompt number.
//
// Batched per slice rather than one call per paragraph, and that is a
// correctness choice as much as a wall-clock one: paragraphs rewritten in
// separate calls are chosen against each other by nobody, so the assembled
// slice reads as stitched fragments. One call sees the whole slice, and the
// judges then rank whole slices.
//
// Returning FEWER rewrites than there are paragraphs is the expected outcome,
// not a degraded one. Nothing in this lane claims the text is wrong, so a
// rewriter with nothing worth changing should say so by staying silent about
// that paragraph.
