/**
 * Tests for reading every optimal alignment out of the heading table.
 *
 * WHY THIS ONE IS WORTH PINNING DIRECTLY. `#71` is what a wrong answer here
 * costs: facing 14 source sections and 12 target ones, the old aligner slid
 * every pairing by two, so every critic call afterwards compared the wrong
 * original against the wrong translation and every issue it filed was noise. A
 * gap belongs where it is, and the sections around it keep their partners.
 *
 * The other half is WIDTH. This is exported so a probe can ask how wide an
 * ambiguity is rather than only that there was one, and hesitating between two
 * adjacent boundaries wants a different remedy from hesitating across a page.
 * Width shows up as a partner set larger than one.
 *
 * THIS TABLE ANSWERS "what does SOME optimal alignment do", not "what may we
 * claim". Two headings sharing nothing still pair here, and the caller decides
 * whether that pairing is admissible. A case at the end pins that boundary so a
 * reader does not mistake this for the policy.
 *
 * Fixtures are cat-themed invention. No corpus content appears here.
