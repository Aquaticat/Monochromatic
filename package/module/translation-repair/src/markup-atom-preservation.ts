// What an edit must carry through (ledger L4). The owner ruled 2026-09-28
// ("Markup atoms") that the atoms survive every edit except a removal an
// addition issue names, and the same day made the quality of the end result a
// standing directive; a replay of the ruling's wording then refused 24 recorded
// edits of which 17 re-marked or moved markup rather than lost it, five of them
// restoring the source's own `DottedNumber` props (`l4-source-carried.mjs`).
// The rule that keeps the ruling's protection and lets those through:
//
// - An atom inside a quote an addition claim made may go: removing the detail
//   an addition quotes is the fix (`addition-repair-rule.ts`).
// - An atom the source carries is copied markup and must survive.
// - An MDX expression, inline code or tag the translation authored (the source
//   does not carry it) may be RE-MARKED, one for one, into an atom of the same
//   kind or one the source carries; it may never simply be dropped.
// - A footnote reference or a link destination has no re-marking excuse: a
//   label or an address is an identifier no checker judges, and the source
//   often carries no footnote at all, so every archive reference would read
//   as authored.
// - An atom one edit drops and another edit of the same patch writes has
//   survived the patch (`settleMarkupMoves`): two shipped edits on
//   yuki418330012 swapped footnote references between clauses.
//
// Gains are always allowed: the atoms the replay found edits adding were
// omission fixes restoring a footnote reference, a link destination or a tag.
