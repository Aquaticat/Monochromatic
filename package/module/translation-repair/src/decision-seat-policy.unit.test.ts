/**
 Guards the whole-package audit of 2026-09-27: the typed decision seat
 (`selectDecision`) voted on every select slate from the task, criteria,
 evidence and candidates alone. The chat seat's sheet carries the house
 rules and the community renderings block, so the decision seat read
 "Complete coverage: every proposition of the ORIGINAL is rendered" with no
 word of reader protection, the tense order, the pronoun rule or the
 precedence line, and never heard that a candidate departed from the
 community's word.

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
