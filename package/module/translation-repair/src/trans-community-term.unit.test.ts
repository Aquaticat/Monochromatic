/**
 Guards class one hundred fifty-four (2026-09-26): 跨圈, the community's
 short form of 跨性别圈子, shipped as "the crossdressing community" on one of
 a page's four uses while the other three read "the trans community", and an
 earlier run had read it "across different communities". The archive renders
 it "the Trans Community" (one entry's heading). The glossary seeds the term with that rendering, and a candidate
 writing "crossdressing community" for it is refused before any judge reads
 it. Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
