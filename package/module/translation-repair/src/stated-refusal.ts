// A REFUSAL A COMMAND STATES IN ITS OWN WORDS, and may therefore repeat.
//
// `#226` put every entry point through `reportingRefusals`, which drops the
// message of any class that has not declared it quote-free. That was the right
// default and it broke something real: twelve throw sites across ten CLIs
// carried usage lines, missing-key lines and probe refusals, and every one of
// them turned into `refused by Error` plus a stack. Those are the messages an
// operator needs MOST, because they are the ones that say what to type next.
//
// WHAT MAY GO IN ONE. Sentences we wrote, arguments the operator supplied
// (flags, paths, draw names), environment variable NAMES, and numbers this
// process computed. Every part is either authored here or handed in by the
// person reading the output.
//
// WHAT MAY NOT. Anything read out of a corpus file, a run file, a model's
// answer or a provider's response body. `model-catalog.ts` had one message
// interpolating an HTTP `statusText`, which is the provider's wording rather
// than ours; the status code says the same thing, so the message was narrowed
// to the code rather than the marker widened to admit it. That direction is the
// point: a message that cannot meet the rule gets rewritten, not exempted.
//
// This is deliberately NOT the same claim as "audited and found clean". A class
// carries the marker because of how its message is BUILT, which stays true as
// the code changes, rather than because someone read it once.
