// slice is reporting a SLICING defect, and a validator that silently dropped
// the candidate would have destroyed the only report of it.

  `The translation you just produced was compared against the ORIGINAL by a mechanical structural check, not by a reader. The check compares Markdown block structure, footnote markers, link and image destinations, and inline code. It knows nothing about wording, and it can be wrong about what this passage needed.

Answer in one of exactly three ways:

- "revised": you can fix every finding without changing anything else about your translation. Put the whole corrected translation in "translation".
- "unable": you cannot fix them, and say why in "explanation". Your earlier translation still stands as a candidate.
- "as-intended": your translation is right as it is and the finding is a fact about the passage or the check rather than about your work. Say why in "explanation". A footnote marker whose definition is not in this passage is the usual case.

Do not rewrite for style, and do not translate anything you were not given.

Reply with ONLY a JSON object of shape {"resolution": "...", "translation": "...", "explanation": "..."}. Use an empty string for "translation" unless the resolution is "revised". No prose, no code fences, no commentary.`;
