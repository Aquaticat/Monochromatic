 Picks the one transcript of a corroborated picture that the other readers
 carry most: the reading whose mean trigram overlap with every other reading
 is highest, the longer one on a tie (the overlap divides by the smaller
 side, so a fuller transcript the others vouch for scores the same as the
 shorter one it extends), and the earliest on a tie of length.

 The archive block review used to receive every corroborating reader's
 transcript. On 2026-09-16 (Mio13) seven of twelve reviewers spent their
 whole completion cap reasoning about one chat translation against six
 transcripts of its screenshots and sent no content; the owner chose one
 transcript per picture (`doc/decision/translation-repair-archive-review-one-transcript-2026-09-16.md`).

 @param readings - transcripts of one picture, at least one

 @returns Reading the others agree with most

 @throws Error when no reading is given
