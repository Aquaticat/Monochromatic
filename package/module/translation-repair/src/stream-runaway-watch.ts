// ONE THING THE DRAIN CAN CALL, so that reading a raw chunk and deciding
// whether the call has run away is a single step at the transport seam rather
// than three of them spread through the read loop.
//
// It owns the scanner and two detectors per channel: the windowed ratio from
// `stream-degeneration.ts` and the buffered recurrence check from
// `stream-recurrence-watch.ts`. Per channel, because a model that thinks in
// circles while writing a fine answer and one that writes in circles after
// thinking clearly are different failures, and pooling them would let either
// excuse the other. Per detector kind, because the two catch different
// periods: the ratio catches short cycling on a small sample, and the
// recurrence check catches the longer periods the ratio's window arithmetic
// is blind to.
//
// THE VERDICT IS A VALUE, not an exception. The drain decides what to do with
// it, which keeps the decision to end a call in the place that owns the
// connection rather than buried here.

 * about four times sooner than the repetition detectors, which need 131,072
 * characters before a cycle becomes visible to them. Both recorded degenerate
 * calls ran just past that threshold, and the two runaway cuts pulled
 * 9,699,969 and 11,366,983 raw characters off the wire before a different
 * guard stopped them.

 * behind it comes from one bed, so a call site that knows its own role emits
 * more should be able to say so, the way the exchange timeout already can.
