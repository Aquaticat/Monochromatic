/**
 Tests for how the consolidation's slate judging names an absence it cannot
 reach.

 WHAT THIS FILE PINS: a decision passes through; an absence over a withheld
 standing, which no judging reaches since a withheld slate ships its
 preference (ledger B51), becomes the fault `WithheldSlateAbsenceError`
 names, carrying the absence; an absence over an eligible standing, and any
 other failure, passes through unchanged.

 Cat-themed invention throughout; no corpus content appears here.
