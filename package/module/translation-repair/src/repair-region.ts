//region Repair region
// The text the accuracy stage actually WROTE, kept region-shaped rather than
// issue-shaped.
//
// Detection and repair are separate questions and only the first was ever
// measured. The grading sheet asks whether an accepted issue is a real defect;
// nothing recorded the replacement, so a correct detection carrying a poor
// repair scored as an unqualified success. Round two shows the gap directly:
// four of thirty-seven true positives came back with the grader asking whether
// there was a better way, and all four counted as successes.
//
// The checker stage does not substitute for that measurement. Across the
// thirty-one settled artifacts of the round-two run, 2215 of 2257 accepted
// issues carry `resolved: true`, so checkers confirm 98.1% of repairs. A verdict
// that near-unanimous separates almost nothing, which is why the question
// belongs on a human sheet.
//
// Region-shaped, not issue-shaped, because envelopes merge OVERLAPPING and
// TOUCHING target-side intervals (`deriveEditableEnvelopes` merges on
// `interval.start <= last.end`), so one replacement can serve several accepted
// issues and may fix only some of them. Copying one replacement onto each issue
// as "the repair for this issue" would erase that. Keeping the served issue ids
// on the region lets a record select the regions naming it while still
// disclosing who else the same edit was written for.
