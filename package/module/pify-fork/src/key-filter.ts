/**
 Member selection for promisification: decides which members of a wrapped
 module are promisified and which pass through untouched.
 
 Derived from [`pify`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pify) by Sindre Sorhus
 (MIT); see `LICENSES/MIT.txt` and this package's README for the full
 attribution. Two upstream quirks are reproduced verbatim because the fuzz
 sidecar's differential oracle compares member selection against upstream
 `pify` 6.1.0 directly:
 
 1. The decision cache is module-level and keyed by target object only, so the
 first `pify` call to read a member freezes that member's promisification
 decision for every later `pify` call on the same object, whatever those
 later calls' `include` / `exclude` options say.
 2. The cache starts as a plain object and membership is tested with `in`, so
 keys living on `Object.prototype` (`'constructor'`, `'toString'`, ...) skip
 include / exclude evaluation entirely and fall through to the `get` trap's
 `Function.prototype` comparison.
