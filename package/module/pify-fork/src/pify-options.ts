/**
 `pify` option types and upstream-compatible default resolution.
 
 The resolver reproduces upstream `pify`'s spread-merge verbatim, quirks
 included: an option key explicitly set to `undefined` overwrites its default
 the same way it does upstream, so a mis-typed caller sees upstream's exact
 later failures (`undefined.some`, `new undefined(...)`) instead of silently
 normalized behavior.

 Merges caller options over upstream `pify`'s defaults with upstream's exact
 spread semantics.
 
 A bare `{}` means upstream's defaults. A caller key explicitly set to
 `undefined` wins over its default, because upstream spreads the caller
 record after the defaults and never re-normalizes; keeping that behavior
 keeps mis-typed callers on upstream's exact failure modes instead of on
 invented ones.

 observe.
