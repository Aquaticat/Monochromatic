//region Capturing a refusal
// Holding what a call threw, so more than one thing can be asserted about it.

/**
 * Runs a call that must refuse and hands back what it threw.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN A SECOND EXPECTATION ON `toThrow`. That matcher
 * takes ONE expectation, a message, a pattern, or a class, so a test wanting
 * BOTH the class and the wording cannot ask for them in a single call. Asking
 * twice on one bound matcher does not work either: chai rebinds the assertion
 * subject to the error it caught, so the second call asserts against that error
 * rather than the function and reports "expected SomeError... to be a function".
 * Holding the thrown value lets each fact be asserted on its own with ordinary
 * matchers, and an assertion that names only a message passes just as happily
 * when the wrong type is thrown.
 *
 * REFUSES A CALL THAT RETURNS rather than handing back `undefined`. Every use of
 * this is a test asserting a refusal, so a call that returned is the failure
 * itself, and saying so here reads better than an `undefined` some later matcher
 * complains about in terms that do not mention throwing.
 *
 * SYNCHRONOUS ONLY, deliberately. A rejected promise needs no equivalent:
 * `expect(promise).rejects` awaits afresh on every matcher call, so asserting a
 * class and then a message against the same promise already works.
 *
 * @param act - call expected to throw
 *
 * @returns Whatever it threw, unchanged and unwrapped
 *
 * @throws Error when `act` returns instead of throwing
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const refusal = caught(function readsAFutureVersion() {
 *   readArtifactSchemaVersion({ artifact, path, },);
 * },);
 *
 * expect(refusal,).toBeInstanceOf(ArtifactParseError,);
 * expect((refusal as Error).message,).toContain('this reader knows',);
 * ```
