 Logs `[PASS] (Nms)` at `debug` on success, so per-test output stays
 out of default verbosity. The parent `describe` surfaces the
 fulfilled child names in a single `info` line, preserving the
 parent-children mapping without one info line per test. `[FAIL]` at
 `error` is always visible; `[SKIP]` at `info`.
 On failure, also emits the caught error inline at `error` level
 (message, stack, `.cause` chain, `AggregateError.errors`) adjacent
 to the `[FAIL]` summary, so the log stream alone is sufficient for
 diagnosis without depending on the runtime's unhandled-rejection
 printer. The throw shape is unchanged.
 Throws `Error(name, { cause })` on failure or timeout, propagating
 the original error as the cause.
