/**
 * Fractional constants composed from the -2..2 magic-literal exempt range.
 *
 * The codebase rule bans inline magic numbers outside -2..2; the workaround
 * for fractional values is to compose them from the exempt range. This module
 * is the canonical source so each fraction is composed once.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import {
 *   HALF,
 *   QUARTER,
 * } from '@monochromatic-dev/module-const';
 * ```

 * @module

 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const midpoint = (start + end,) * HALF;

 * One quarter (0.25), composed as {@link HALF} divided by 2.

 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const radius = side * QUARTER;

 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const fillTarget = capacity * THREE_QUARTERS;
