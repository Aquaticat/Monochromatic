# module-const

Ready to publish.

Universal constants for the Monochromatic monorepo.
This package is the canonical home for values whose authority is context-free:
mathematical relationships,
 physical unit relationships,
 and externally specified code or character sets.
App-specific defaults and domain-format sentinels stay with the package that owns that policy or parser.

## Exports

The package is source-only.
The `.` entry point resolves to `./src/index.ts`,
which re-exports every constant from per-category sibling files.

## Usage

```ts
import {
  ASCII_LOWERCASE_ALPHANUMERIC_CHARS,
  BYTES_PER_KIB,
  HALF,
  HTTP_NOT_FOUND,
  MS_PER_SECOND,
} from '@monochromatic-dev/module-const';

const ttlMs = 30 * MS_PER_SECOND;
const bufferBytes = 64 * BYTES_PER_KIB;
const midpoint = (start + end) * HALF;
const tokenChars = ASCII_LOWERCASE_ALPHANUMERIC_CHARS;
return new Response(tokenChars[0], { status: HTTP_NOT_FOUND, },);
```

## Scope

In scope:

- Mathematical and physical relationships,
   including time-unit ratios,
   byte-unit ratios,
   and fractions.
- Codes and character sets defined by external specifications,
   including RFC 9110 HTTP status codes and ASCII.
- Context-free constants whose meaning does not change when a consuming package changes policy.

Out of scope:

- App-specific defaults,
   including timeouts,
   ports,
   retry counts,
   and z-index tiers.
  Centralising these would couple unrelated apps into lockstep when one wants to tune a default.
  Define such constants in the package that owns the policy.
- Domain-specific magic numbers,
   including ZIP format signatures and file-format thresholds.
  Define these in the package's `constants.ts`,
   next to the code that interprets them.

## KB vs KiB

The IEC and SI byte units differ at every prefix beyond bytes.
This package exports both with their spec-correct values:

- `BYTES_PER_KIB = 1_024`,
   binary,
   IEC 80000-13.
- `BYTES_PER_KB = 1_000`,
   decimal,
   SI.

Earlier callers used `BYTES_PER_KB = 1_024`,
 which conflated the two.
When migrating an inline `BYTES_PER_KB = 1_024` definition,
rename to `BYTES_PER_KIB`.

## Design decisions

- Source-only package.
  The package has no build step;
   consumers import directly from `src/index.ts`.
  Constants do not benefit from bundling,
   and skipping the build keeps the workspace install fast.
- Universal/spec scope instead of a global const registry.
  A constant belongs here when its authority is an external spec or context-free relationship.
  Values owned by one package stay in that package even when their spelling is reusable.
- Conservative inclusion.
  Add constants after a second use site,
   or when one concrete consumer needs a spec-defined primitive
  that has no app or domain owner.
  Speculative categories stay in the consuming package until a real extraction point appears.
- Composed values use named primitives,
   not literals.
  `MS_PER_HOUR` is `MS_PER_MINUTE * MINUTES_PER_HOUR`,
   not `3_600_000`.
  This makes corrections propagate automatically and documents the relationship.
- Per-category sibling files.
  `ascii.ts`,
   `time.ts`,
   `byte.ts`,
   `http-status.ts`,
   and `fraction.ts` each own their domain.
  `index.ts` is pure re-exports.
  New categories arrive as new sibling files,
   not as additions to one growing file.
