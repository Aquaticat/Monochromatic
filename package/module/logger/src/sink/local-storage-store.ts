 * live in this instance's closure (no module-global state), so independent
 * sinks and tests never share keys or need a reset hook.
 *
 * Unlike sessionStorage, localStorage is shared by every tab of the origin and
 * survives restarts, so this engine differs from the sessionStorage engine in
 * two ways. Keys carry a run identity (see `local-storage-key.ts`), so
 * concurrent tabs never collide on a counter. And on its first persist the
 * engine adopts every strictly-parsed entry left by other runs into its
 * footprint tally, evicting those oldest-first before its own entries;
 * without that, leftovers from dead sessions would fill the store until no
 * run could ever write again. Adoption is deferred to first persist rather
 * than construction so building the default sink set never touches
 * `globalThis.localStorage` on runtimes where the sink never verifies (plain
 * Node warns on mere access). Keys that fail the strict parse, including the
 * host application's, are never counted and never evicted.
 *
 * The engine caps its own footprint (adopted entries included) at half the

 * reactively drops again if the real store still overflows; see
