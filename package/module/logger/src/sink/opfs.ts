/**
 * Builds an OPFS sink that buffers serialized records through the shared
 * {@link createRecordBuffer} policy and appends each newline-joined JSONL
 * batch to a per-session file in the Origin Private File System with one
 * stream write per batch. The kept-open writable stream lives in this
 * instance's closure (no module-global state), so independent loggers and
 * tests never share a handle or need a reset hook.
 *
 * Flush triggers (32 KiB in-write cap, `warn`-or-worse severity, 250 ms
 * quiet-period deadline, page lifecycle, and the `flush` hook) are the
 * buffer's; see {@link createRecordBuffer}. Batch writes queue on the stream
 * in issue order, so ordering holds at the batch boundary, and the sink's
 * `flush` hook awaits every issued batch before resolving.
 *
 * @returns Sink backed by OPFS.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const { logger } = createLogger({ sinks: [createOpfsSink()] });
 * logger.warn('quota nearing limit');
 * ```
