/**
 * Per-runtime default localStorage quota heuristics.
 *
 * The Web Storage API exposes no way to read the localStorage quota (unlike
 * `navigator.storage.estimate()`, which reports the unrelated persistent-storage
 * budget), so the sink caps its own footprint from a table of measured
 * defaults. Each figure was fill-probed on a fresh store: values are written at
 * a growing single key until a `QuotaExceededError`, binary-searching the
 * largest that fits. Figures are UTF-16 code units (JS string length, counting
 * key plus value) because that is what localStorage measures and what the sink
 * compares `serialized.length` against.

 * - `node`: 5 MiB on Node 26 launched with `--localstorage-file`.
 * - `browser`: 5 MiB, measured on headless Chromium 149 over an
 *   `http://127.0.0.1` origin. Firefox and WebKit are assumed to share the
 *   bucket: both measured 5 MiB for sessionStorage under Playwright v1.61 and

 * Bun 1.3 exposes no `localStorage`, so its bucket is uncapped: its sink never
 * verifies and never reaches the cap. An unrecognized runtime is also uncapped
 * so the caller relies on reactive eviction alone.
