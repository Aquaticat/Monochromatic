 * needed. Retention trims oldest-first past {@link MAX_STORED_BATCHES}.

 * browser's storage backend promptly and survive renderer crashes, and the
 * OS-crash window `durability: 'strict'` would close is the rarest failure
 * class, not worth an fsync per batch.

 * quiet-period deadline, page lifecycle, and the `flush` hook) are the
 * buffer's; see {@link createRecordBuffer}. The sink's `flush` hook awaits
