/**
 * Per-runtime default sessionStorage quota heuristics.
 *
 * The Web Storage API exposes no way to read the sessionStorage quota (unlike
 * `navigator.storage.estimate()`, which reports the unrelated persistent-storage
 * budget), so the sink caps its own footprint from a table of measured
 * defaults. Each figure was fill-probed on a fresh store: values are written at
 * a growing single key until a `QuotaExceededError`, binary-searching the
 * largest that fits. Figures are UTF-16 code units (JS string length, counting
 * key plus value) because that is what sessionStorage measures and what the
 * sink compares `serialized.length` against.
