/**
 Known aliasing and cycle divergences in deepmerge-ts, found by the graph
 properties in `./alias-graph.property.unit.test.ts`.

 Same contract as `./known-defect.unit.test.ts`: each test asserts that the
 divergence still reproduces beside the outcome it should have, so the unit
 suite stays green while upstream is unfixed and turns red when behaviour
 changes. The comment on each test names the cause and the excluded region.

 Several false-cycle variants here are closed by the fork branch
 `fix/false-cycle-detection` (built with `fork:build`); against that build
 those tests turn red, while the ones marked "not closed by the fix branch"
 stay green.
