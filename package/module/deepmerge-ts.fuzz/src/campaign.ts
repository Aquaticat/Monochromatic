/**
 Unbounded fuzz campaign driver, run by the `fuzz` mise task inside a capped
 podman container.

 Rounds forever: each round draws one fresh seed and runs every
 `*.property.unit.test.ts` file as its own node process with that seed and
 the configured run count (see `./fuzz-budget.ts`). The first failing file
 stops the campaign after writing a replay record (file, seed, run count,
 round, and the process output, which includes fast-check's shrunk
 counterexample and path) as JSON into the failure directory.

 Replay a record on the host with
 `DEEPMERGE_FUZZ_SEED=<seed> DEEPMERGE_FUZZ_NUM_RUNS=<runs> node <file>`.
