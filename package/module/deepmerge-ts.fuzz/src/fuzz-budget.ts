/**
 Shared run plan for the property files.

 The same `*.property.unit.test.ts` files serve two layers. Run by the
 normal unit suite (environment unset), each property does a bounded number
 of runs from one fixed seed, so `test:unit` and the `fuzz:coverage` gate are
 reproducible. Run by `src/campaign.ts` (environment set), each property does
 one campaign round: the round's run count from a fresh seed the campaign
 chooses and records, so a counterexample replays from the recorded seed.

 The campaign is unbounded across rounds, not within one: an in-process
 unbounded property would starve every later property of the same file.
