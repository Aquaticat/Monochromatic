/**
 Deterministic workload model and runner shared by this package's property
 files.
 
 A workload schedules generated calls against a limiter adapter, then walks
 generated release steps: each step optionally applies an action (raising or
 lowering the bound, clearing the queue) and then releases one call's gate.
 Everything the limiter does is decided by the workload, so two limiters fed
 the same workload produce directly comparable traces.
