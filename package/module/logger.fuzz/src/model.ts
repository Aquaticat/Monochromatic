/**
 Reference model of the logger orchestration.

 The model folds a trace of operations (`log`, `init-complete`, `flush`) and
 fake-sink observations (`verify` settlements) into what the logger's
 contract promises: per sink, the exact records attempted in order and the
 final availability; the dropped-startup count and whether the marker record
 is due; whether each `flush()` settles inside its deadline; and how many
 breadcrumbs the logger must have written. Write and flush outcomes are not
 observed, they are read from the scripts by call index, so the model never
 copies the logger's bookkeeping, only its promises.

 Assumptions the properties keep true: the verify time limit is shorter
 than the flush deadline, so a `never` verify makes init complete before a
 flush deadline can elapse; and every settleable outcome is released before
 the trace is folded, so only `never` outcomes are still pending.
