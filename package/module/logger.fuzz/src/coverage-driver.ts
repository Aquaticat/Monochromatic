/**
 Deterministic coverage driver for the module-logger fuzz coverage gate.

 Imports the runtime package's source through its `/ts` subpath, so V8
 coverage attributes to `package/module/logger/src`, and replays fixed
 scenarios through every orchestration branch and every Node-reachable
 sink branch. Run under `NODE_V8_COVERAGE` (and `--localstorage-file`, so
 the localStorage sink elects) by the `fuzz:coverage` task, then
 summarized by `coverage-report.ts`.

 A reachability harness, not an oracle: it asserts nothing, because the
 property suite owns correctness. Console output, breadcrumbs included, is
 silenced for the run so the gate's log stays readable; every breadcrumb
 this driver provokes is deliberate.
