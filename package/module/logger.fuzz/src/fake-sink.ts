/**
 Scripted fake sink for the logger campaign.

 A `SinkScript` says, per hook, what each call does: the head lists the
 outcomes of the first calls in order and the tail is the outcome every later
 call receives, so "first write rejects, later writes succeed" is
 `{ head: ['reject'], tail: 'resolve' }`. The sink carries a stable index so a
 shrunk counterexample names it (`sink 2: verify [resolve-true*] write
 [reject, resolve*] flush absent`) and appends a trace event when a hook is
 called and when its outcome settles, which the reference model folds.

 Timing is not part of the script: an optional `schedule` gate (fast-check's
 `scheduler().schedule` in the properties) decides when a settleable outcome
 reaches the logger, and `never` is a promise nobody ever resolves.
