/**
 Runs one generated program against a real logger built over scripted fake
 sinks while folding the same program into the reference model, so a property
 can compare the two afterwards.

 The fast-check scheduler decides when each scripted outcome reaches the
 logger; the harness drives it one release at a time (`release` steps), lets
 the microtask queue drain, then reads the fake-sink trace to feed the model
 the verify settlements in the order the logger saw them. Init completion is
 observed through `initPromise`, and a `never` verify is folded as such right
 before it.

 Two real timers stay in play: the verify time limit and the flush deadline.
 The harness keeps the verify limit shorter than the deadline and waits for
 init before every flush, so the model's "hung" verdict for a flush depends
 only on `never` outcomes.
