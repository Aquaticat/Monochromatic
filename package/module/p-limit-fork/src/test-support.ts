 Test-only scheduling helpers shared by this package's unit tests.
 
 Gates make concurrency tests deterministic: each scheduled call blocks on
 its own gate, and the test releases gates one at a time in a chosen order,
 so start and settle sequences are decided by the test rather than by
 scheduler timing.
