# Fuzzing forbidden-strings

Coverage-guided fuzzing for the scanner's own surfaces after the engine swap
(#383/#384/#385):
 the literal-to-verbose-dialect escaper,
 the strict two-form rule loader,
 and the columnless `PATH:LINE rule=N` scan output.
 Engine-level fuzzing (the `RegexSet` compile,
 serialize,
 and `line_matches`
paths) lives in the engine's own sidecar at
`package/rust-module/forbidden-regex.fuzz` and is not duplicated here.
 CI integration is **deferred**;
 targets are exercised locally and on demand only.
 The rationale and rejected alternatives are recorded in
[`doc/decision/forbidden-strings-fuzzing.md`](../../../doc/decision/forbidden-strings-fuzzing.md).

## Prerequisites

- Nightly Rust toolchain.
   `cargo-fuzz` injects `-Cllvm-args=-sanitizer-coverage-*` flags that only work
  on nightly,
   and its default AddressSanitizer path emits nightly-only `-Zsanitizer`
  (see [`doc/troubleshooting/cargo-fuzz-nightly-rust.md`](../../../doc/troubleshooting/cargo-fuzz-nightly-rust.md)).
   The toolchain is managed repo-wide in the root
  [`mise.no-env.toml`](../../../mise.no-env.toml) `[tools]` entry
  (`rust = { version = "nightly", components = "rust-src,llvm-tools-preview" }`),
   so `mise install` provisions nightly (with std sources and the llvm coverage
  tools) for every crate,
   and tasks run here inherit it.
- `cargo-fuzz`.
   Installed automatically by `mise install` from the root
  [`mise.no-env.toml`](../../../mise.no-env.toml) `[tools]` entry.
- A C++ toolchain (clang or gcc).
   `libfuzzer-sys` builds a small C++ runtime that the targets link against.
- `podman` (or `docker`) for the bounded-container wrapper described below.

## Target list

Each target encodes one invariant.
 Failures are libFuzzer crashes with a redacted reproducer message
(input length plus SHA-256,
 never raw bytes).

The three targets share a single tuned dictionary at
`dictionary/forbidden-strings.dict` (one dictionary,
 not per-target).
 Each target has its own per-target seed corpus under `seed/<target>/`
(tracked),
 separate from the gitignored scratch corpus under `corpus/<target>/`;
 fuzz invocations pass both as libFuzzer corpus dirs with scratch first,
 so new discoveries land only in scratch.

- **`fuzz_literal_roundtrip`** -- syntax-boundary transformer.
   Drives the real `escape_literal` over arbitrary strings and compiles its
  output as a single-pattern `RegexSet`:
   the escaped pattern must compile,
   must match the literal itself,
   and must never match empty input (the comment-swallow / empty-matchable
  regression guard).
   A fixed adversarial battery runs once per process so the always-verbose
  boundary cases (spaces,
   leading `#`,
   quotes,
   backslashes,
   metacharacters,
  escape-sequence lookalikes,
   newlines) are always exercised.
- **`fuzz_scan_format`** -- columnless output contract.
   Loads a generated two-form ruleset and scans a generated multi-line buffer,
   asserting every finding is exactly `PATH:LINE rule=N` (or the fail-closed
  `PATH: engine error`),
   the line index is 1-based and within the buffer,
   findings arrive line-ascending,
   and no content byte leaks into the finding (redaction is structural:
   the formatter interpolates only the fixed path and two integers).
- **`fuzz_ruleset_scan_invariants`** -- strict loader plus scan invariants.
   Drives `load_from_text` and `scan_file` over a generated ruleset and buffer:
   a rejected flag fails the load closed,
   `m`/`x` are no-ops,
   a file with no rule line loads nothing (a fixed loader-contract battery pins
  the flag policy every process),
   and reversing the rule order renumbers ids but never changes which positions
  match (rule-order invariance).

## Local commands (via mise)

All commands run on nightly automatically:
 the repo-root `rust = nightly` tool applies its toolchain to every task.

```bash
# List every target name.
mise run //package/fuzz/forbidden-strings:list

# Type-check the shared generator library and its unit tests.
mise run //package/fuzz/forbidden-strings:test

# Build every target.
mise run //package/fuzz/forbidden-strings:build

# 30-second smoke run across every target (uses the dictionary).
mise run //package/fuzz/forbidden-strings:smoke

# Single-target campaign with passthrough libFuzzer args.
mise run //package/fuzz/forbidden-strings:run fuzz_literal_roundtrip -- -max_total_time=120
```

## Bounded-container wrapper (resource-exhaustion rule)

The repo's resource-exhaustion-isolation policy applies:
 every fuzz command must run inside a memory-and-CPU-bounded container.
 Past authorisation does not transfer;
 each heavy run requires the wrapper.

```bash
podman run \
  --memory=2g \
  --cpus=2 \
  --rm \
  -v "$PWD":/work \
  -w /work \
  <rust-nightly-image> \
  mise run //package/fuzz/forbidden-strings:smoke
```

The image needs nightly Rust,
 cargo-fuzz,
 and clang.
 A local builder VM (`mvm`) is the recommended alternative when a prebuilt image
isn't handy.

## Corpus and artifact policy

- `seed/<target>/seed-*` -- curated seed files committed to the repo (tracked
  plainly;
   no `.gitignore` re-include needed).
   Hand-curated:
   the `fuzz_literal_roundtrip` seeds are the adversarial escaping cases;
   the format-driven targets carry a few small two-form-shaped byte seeds the
  `Arbitrary` decoder expands into a starting corpus.
   Seed contents must never contain a raw secret-shaped string (the tracked
  files are scanned by the repo commit gate);
   use the crate's byte-escape convention if a fixture ever needs one.
- `corpus/<target>/` -- libFuzzer's corpus growth (scratch).
   Wholly ignored.
   The smoke and run tasks pass `corpus/<target> seed/<target>` as explicit
  corpus dirs;
   libFuzzer reads both and writes new discoveries only to the first.
- `artifacts/` -- libFuzzer's crash reproducers.
   Always ignored.
   Open one with `cat artifacts/<target>/crash-*` ONLY in a private session;
   the artifact bytes are the exact fuzzer-mutated input that triggered the
  crash and may contain secret-shaped bytes.
- `coverage/` -- coverage data.
   Ignored.
- `Cargo.lock`:
   Committed so the fuzz toolchain stays reproducible.

The local deny-list (`../../cli/forbidden-strings/forbidden-strings.local.txt`)
and its append sibling must NEVER enter the corpus,
 dictionary,
 or reproducer text.
 There is no automated seeder;
 hand-curated corpus / dictionary / reproducer edits are entirely the
contributor's responsibility.

## Crash reproduction and minimization

When a target reports a crash:

1. The reproducer lives at `artifacts/<target>/crash-<sha>`.
    Note its path.
2. Re-run the exact input to confirm:
   ```bash
   mise run //package/fuzz/forbidden-strings:run \
     <target> -- artifacts/<target>/crash-<sha>
   ```
3. Minimize it via `cargo +nightly fuzz tmin <target> artifacts/<target>/crash-<sha>`
   -- libFuzzer finds the smallest input that still reproduces the panic.
4. Format the minimised input for readability via
   `cargo +nightly fuzz fmt <target> <path>` (decodes the bytes through the
   target's `Arbitrary` impl and prints the structured form).
5. **Redaction**:
    when filing an issue or commit message about the crash,
    NEVER paste raw reproducer bytes.
    The panic message every target prints already includes the redacted
   fingerprint (input length plus SHA-256) -- that is the reproducer shape to
   share.

## Fail-closed boundary

The scanner wraps every `RegexSet::line_matches` call in `std::panic::catch_unwind`
(`src/frx_scan.rs`);
 the engine's own `Cargo.toml` documents that it deliberately installs no
internal panic guard and expects this caller to provide the boundary.
 A caught engine panic surfaces as the redacted synthetic finding
`PATH: engine error`,
 which the format-driven targets accept as one of the two documented output
shapes.
 A genuine panic in a target's own assertion code calls the default hook and
`abort()`s,
 so libFuzzer records a crash.
 `panic = "unwind"` is pinned in this crate's `Cargo.toml` so that boundary keeps
working under the sanitizer build.
