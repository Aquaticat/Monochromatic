# @monochromatic-dev/cli-mutation-test.fixture

Deliberately half-tested fixture for `cli-mutation-test` integration runs.

Expected outcomes when the mutation tester runs against this package:

- `src/calc.ts` `clampedSum`: fully tested, so its arithmetic and
  conditional mutants must be killed.
- `src/calc.ts` `describeSign`: zero branch untested on purpose, so its
  mutants must survive (confirmed).
- `src/untested.ts`: no tests select it, so every mutant short-circuits
  to survived without a container run.

The source stays intentionally tiny so integration assertions can pin
exact expectations without churn.
