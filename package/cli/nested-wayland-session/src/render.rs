//! Rendering the hosted window into the nested winit framebuffer.

//! One `redraw` call binds the winit backend's framebuffer, composites the space
//! (the one hosted window) into it with Smithay's `render_output` helper, submits the
//! frame, and sends frame-callbacks so the client draws its next frame.

/// What:     `use std::time::Duration;`. A span of time.
/// Why:      Frame callbacks report elapsed time; `Duration::ZERO` is the throttle hint.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// // Duration ~ a millisecond count.
/// ```

///           of four 32-bit floats (`f32`; sibling `f64` is 64-bit). Order is
///           red, green, blue, alpha.
