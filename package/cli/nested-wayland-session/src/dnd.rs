//! Compositor-originated drag-and-drop, for testing a hosted app's INBOUND file drop.
//!
//! A real inbound drag needs a second client (a file manager) to be the drag source.
//! Smithay 0.7 instead lets the compositor itself be the source via
//! [`start_dnd`](smithay::wayland::selection::data_device::start_dnd): it installs a
//! server pointer grab that, as the pointer moves over the hosted app's surface, sends
//! the app a `wl_data_offer` + `enter`, then (on button release) a `drop`. The app
//! then requests the data, which arrives in `ServerDndGrabHandler::send` (see
//! `handler.rs`). This module drives that sequence from a `drop-file` control command,
//! giving a deterministic, single-app inbound-drop test with no file manager involved.
//!
//! Why the release is deferred: Wayland DnD requires the target client to `accept` a
//! mime type and choose an action (`set_actions`) BETWEEN the enter and the drop. Those
//! are client round-trips. Releasing the button in the same synchronous call cancels the
//! drop as unvalidated, so the release is scheduled on a short dwell timer instead.
