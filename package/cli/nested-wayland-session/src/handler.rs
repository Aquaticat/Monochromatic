//! Wayland protocol handler implementations for `Compositor`.
//!
//! Smithay dispatches each protocol's events by calling trait methods on the state.
//! This file holds the seat (input focus), data-device (clipboard), and output
//! handlers plus their `delegate_*!` glue; the compositor/shm, xdg-shell, and dmabuf
//! handlers live in the submodules declared below.

/// What:     `pub mod compositor;`. Declares the `compositor` submodule from
///           `src/handler/compositor.rs` and re-exports it publicly.
/// Why:      Holds the surface-commit and shared-memory handlers.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// export * as compositor from "./handler/compositor";
/// ```
pub mod compositor;

/// What:     `pub mod xdg_shell;`. Declares the xdg-shell submodule.
/// Why:      Holds the toplevel/popup handler that maps the app fullscreen.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// export * as xdgShell from "./handler/xdg_shell";
/// ```
pub mod xdg_shell;

/// What:     `pub mod dmabuf;`. Declares the dmabuf submodule.
/// Why:      Holds the GPU-buffer import handler.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// export * as dmabuf from "./handler/dmabuf";
/// ```
pub mod dmabuf;

/// What:     Grouped `use` of the seat, output, data-device, and delegate items.
/// Why:      Bring the traits and macros the impls below need into scope.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// import { SeatHandler, OutputHandler, ... } from "smithay";
/// ```
