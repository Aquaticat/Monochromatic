//! The nested screen's size and output scale, as plain numbers independent of any display.
//!
//! The caller sets a logical size (`--size`, `resize`) and an output scale (`--scale`, `scale`).
//! The physical framebuffer, which screenshots and recordings capture, is the logical size
//! multiplied by the scale and rounded half away from zero, the rounding
//! `wp_fractional_scale_v1` prescribes for toplevel surfaces. Changing only the scale keeps the
//! logical size, the way a window keeps its size when it moves to an output with another
//! scale, so a hosted client sees a scale change without a resize. Input coordinates stay
//! logical at every scale.
