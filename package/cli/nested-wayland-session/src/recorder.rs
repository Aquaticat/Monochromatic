//! The 60fps frame recorder: a steady, drift-free capture timer decoupled from the app.
//!
//! On each tick (on the render thread) it reads the current framebuffer back into a pooled
//! buffer and hands it to the encoder pool, then sends frame callbacks so an animating app
//! keeps drawing. It never calls `submit`, so the parent compositor's vsync cannot throttle
//! the capture cadence, and it composites whatever the app LAST committed, so a laggy app
//! merely yields repeated frames rather than stalling the sequence. The schedule is
//! absolute (start + n*period) with resync, so it does not drift.
