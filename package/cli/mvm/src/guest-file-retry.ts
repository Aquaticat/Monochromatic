/**
 Repeats a guest agent file command that got no answer.

 A guest under load can leave the agent silent for minutes: on 2026-10-05 a
 Windows guest stopped answering during a 64 MiB push for at least 2 minutes
 and 52 seconds, and the push failed because it had asked only three times in
 25 seconds. A command is therefore repeated until the agent answers, the
 domain is gone, or the silence has lasted the limit.
