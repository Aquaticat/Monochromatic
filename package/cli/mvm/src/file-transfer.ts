/**
 File transfer between host and guest VM.

 A VM created on a host where libvirt can run `virtiofsd` has a `shared/`
 directory on the host exposed inside the guest at `/mnt/shared` (Linux) or
 `Z:\` (Windows via WinFSP + virtiofs driver). Push and pull copy files
 to/from this shared directory on the host; the guest sees changes
 immediately through the virtiofs mount.

 A VM created on a host without `virtiofsd` has no shared directory. Push and
 pull then read and write the guest's own files through the QEMU guest agent,
 and the guest path must be absolute. Each VM's metadata records which of the
 two applies.

 Pushes a file from the host filesystem into a running VM.

 For a VM with the virtiofs shared directory, the file is copied into the
 VM's shared directory on the host.
 The guest can access it at {@link GUEST_MOUNT_POINT}`/{filename}` (Linux)
 or {@link WINDOWS_GUEST_MOUNT_POINT}`\{filename}` (Windows).
 Only the file name of `guestPath` is used: the file is placed at
 `shared/{basename}` and the caller should use the returned guest path to
 reference it.

 For a VM without the shared directory, the file is written to `guestPath`
 itself through the guest agent; the path must be absolute and its directory
 must exist.

 @param name - VM name without the mvm- prefix

 @param hostPath - Absolute or relative path on the host to read from

 @param guestPath - Desired filename or path inside the guest.
 With the shared directory, a bare filename is enough; without it, the full path in the guest.

 @returns Absolute path inside the guest where the file is accessible
