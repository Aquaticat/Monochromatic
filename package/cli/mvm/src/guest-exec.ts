/**
 Runs one shell command in a guest through the QEMU guest agent and returns
 the result that provably belongs to it.

 The agent keeps a finished command's result until someone reads it and finds
 it by process ID alone, so a process ID the guest reuses can first return an
 older command's result. Every command therefore prints a fresh marker line
 first, and only a result carrying that marker is returned. A status request
 that gets no answer while the guest is busy is asked again; it says nothing
 about the command.
