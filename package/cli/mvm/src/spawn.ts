/**
 Runs one host command to completion and returns what it printed.

 The command's output goes to private temporary files and the call completes
 when the command itself exits. It does not wait for the output streams to
 close: a background process the command leaves behind, such as the libvirt
 session daemon that `virsh` starts on demand, keeps inherited streams open
 for as long as it lives, which made one piped `virsh` call take two minutes.
