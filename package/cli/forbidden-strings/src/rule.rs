//! Rule compilation for the forbidden-strings scanner.
//!
//! After the engine swap (#385 teardown) this module carries only the
//! forbidden-regex rule compiler. The resharp/`regex`-crate pipeline that once
//! lived beside it (set-algebra pre-validators, the aho-corasick shard
//! architecture, the engine-routing predicate, and their loaders) was deleted
//! once the binary stopped reaching it; the live load and scan paths are
//! `crate::frx_load` and `crate::frx_scan`, both built on `crate::rule::frx`.

/// Registers the `frx` child module: the forbidden-regex rule compiler.
///
/// `pub` so `lib.rs` can re-export its entry points as crate-public API. It owns
/// the two-form rule-file format, the flag policy, UTF-8 BOM stripping, redacted
/// load-error reporting, and both construction paths (from rule text and from a
/// serialized precompiled `RegexSet`).
pub mod frx;
