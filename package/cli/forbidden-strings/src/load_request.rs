//! What: Thread-isolated rule-load requests executed through a named unwind boundary.
//! Why: Loading may fail before a Scanner exists; no partial ruleset or panic payload may become a successful result.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // Closest analogue: context.run(request, namedLoad), but this slot is per native thread and synchronous.
//! ```

/// Import the existing loader and its established error channel.
use crate::frx_load::{self, LoadedRules};
/// Imports the shipped baseline's precompiled engine bytes and rule names passed to every load.
use crate::{BUILTIN_NAMES, BUILTIN_PRECOMPILED};
/// Imports the loader's error channel and the macro building its fixed redacted messages.
use anyhow::{anyhow, Result};
/// Import a per-thread value slot.
use std::cell::Cell;
/// Imports borrowed caller paths and the owned copy a pending request keeps.
use std::path::{Path, PathBuf};

/// Owned arguments crossing the no-capture callback boundary.

// What: thread_local! is the standard-library declaration for one Cell per native thread.
// Cell moves values in/out; unlike RefCell, no borrow remains active across the compiler call.
// Why: Named catch_unwind callbacks take no arguments, and a process-global request would race between concurrent callers.

// ```ts
// // A synchronous per-thread request slot, not one shared process variable or captured callback.
