//! A tail-format file is what `tail --verbose -n +1` over per-rule files would
//! produce: `==> name <==` header lines open sections whose bodies are rules.
//! Every section is exactly one rule, so every rule carries its own name. A body
//! with one significant line classifies by the incumbent two-form rule (bare
//! literal or single-line `/PATTERN/FLAGS`); a body with more than one significant
//! line is one verbatim pattern handed to the always-verbose engine, which ignores
//! blank lines and first-column `#` comments itself. Arrow-leading near-headers,
//! duplicate names, empty sections, and pre-header content each fail the load
//! closed with a redacted, line-numbered error. Autodetection and the byte-for-byte
//! legacy path live in the sibling `format` module.
