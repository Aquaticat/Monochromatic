//! Autodetects the rule-file format and parses it into engine-ready patterns.

//! A leading UTF-8 BOM is stripped once. The first significant line (after blank
//! and `#`-comment lines) then selects the format: a strict `==> name <==` header
//! routes the whole file through the tail-format parser in the sibling `sections`
//! module, and any other shape routes the whole file through the legacy line-based
//! path here, which parses byte-for-byte as before. One file never mixes formats.
//!
//! The legacy path treats a blank or `#`-comment line as a skip, a `/PATTERN/FLAGS`
//! line whose trailing run is all ASCII-lowercase as a regex rule (with `m`/`x`
//! accepted as no-ops and any other flag a hard fail-closed error), and every other
//! non-blank line as a bare literal escaped into the verbose dialect, short ones
//! gated behind word boundaries. That single-line classification is shared with a
//! one-significant-line tail-format section, so both keep the incumbent two forms.
