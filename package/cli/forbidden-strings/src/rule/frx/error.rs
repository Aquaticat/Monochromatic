//! Redacted load-error type for the forbidden-regex rule compiler.
//!
//! Every variant is safe to print on stdout or stderr: it carries an opaque rule
//! index (the rule's 0-based position in the compiled set, never a source line
//! number) and the engine's own static reason, but never the rule text. This is
//! the load-path half of the README's leak-safety guarantee (#217): a sensitive
//! rule body may live in a CI secret without its bytes reaching CI logs.
