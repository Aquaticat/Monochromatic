# Done; AI-powered task aggregator

## Elevator pitch

A todo app that knows what you should do right now based on where you are and what matters to you,
 powered by a self-hosted AI model.

## Core concept

Done is a single-tenant PWA for task management.
Each user runs their own instance,
 provisioned automatically on registration.

### Authentication and instance lifecycle

The orchestrator handles everything:
 auth,
 reverse proxy,
 and process management;
 no Caddy or AuthCrunch needed.
Coolify's own reverse proxy terminates HTTPS upstream,
 so the orchestrator only listens on HTTP internally.
Path-based routing (`done.app/u/<user-id>/`) instead of subdomains:
 avoids DNS API calls on registration,
 offensive subdomain risk,
 wildcard cert complexity,
 and registrar rate limits.

1. User registers with email on the orchestrator's own registration page,
    verified via SMTP (through `@upyo/smtp`)
2. Orchestrator hashes password with a Node-compatible argon2id password hasher,
    stores user record in `orchestrator.db`
3. On login,
    orchestrator verifies password,
    creates a session row in `orchestrator.db` with a random 32-byte hex token,
    sets cookie (`HttpOnly` / `SameSite=Strict` / `Secure`,
    scoped to `/u/<user-id>/`)
4. Orchestrator spawns a new **Node + h3 Done process** (`node src/server.ts --port=XXXX --db=/data/<user-id>/done.db`)
5. On every request to `/u/<user-id>/*`,
    orchestrator validates the session cookie and checks that the session's user-id matches the path,
    then reverse-proxies to `localhost:$PORT`,
    stripping the `/u/<user-id>` prefix
6. Unauthenticated requests get redirected to the login page;
    wrong-user requests get 403
7. The orchestrator **suspends idle instances** (kill + respawn on next request) and **wakes them on URL access** (cold-start pattern)

The Done app never sees unauthenticated requests.
User IDs are opaque (ULIDs),
 not user-chosen names;
 no abuse vector for offensive URLs.

Auth security considerations:

- Password hashing uses a Node-compatible argon2id implementation with constant-time verification
- Sessions are server-side lookup tokens (random 32-byte hex IDs stored in `orchestrator.db`),
   not signed JWTs;
   no crypto to get wrong
- Session cookies:
   `HttpOnly` + `Secure` + `SameSite=Strict`,
   cookie `Path` set to `/u/<user-id>/`
- Rate limit login attempts:
   in-memory counter per IP,
   max 10/minute
- Same error message for wrong email and wrong password (no user enumeration)
- New session ID generated on every login (no session fixation)

The AI is self-hosted via llama.
cpp,
 giving full control over the model and eliminating provider ban risk from user content.
It does not just organize tasks;
 it actively surfaces the right task at the right time and place.

## Tech stack

- **Runtime**:
   Node (server) and tsdown (bundler)
- **Framework**:
   h3 server with vanilla TypeScript client bundles.
   The server owns page routes and REST API routes under `/api/...`;
   client pages read server-embedded JSON and build DOM imperatively.
- **Database**:
   libsql (SQLite-compatible,
   single file,
   local)
- **AI**:
   Self-hosted llama.
  cpp (OpenAI-compatible API,
   full model control,
   no provider ban risk).
   Primary model:
   Qwen3-1.7B (Q4_K_M,
   ~1.2GB RAM,
   CPU-only,
   non-thinking mode for fast autofill).
   Fallback:
   LFM2.5-1.2B-Instruct (under 1GB,
   239 tok/s on CPU).
- **Auth + reverse proxy**:
   Orchestrator (Node):
   handles registration,
   login,
   session cookies,
   path ACL enforcement,
   and HTTP reverse proxy to user processes.
   No Caddy or AuthCrunch;
   Coolify's reverse proxy terminates HTTPS upstream.
- **Email**:
   `@upyo/smtp` (JSR):
   generic SMTP transport;
   works with Resend,
   Fastmail,
   or any SMTP provider.
   If the transport fails,
   that's the provider's problem,
   not ours.
- **Deployment**:
   Docker Compose on Coolify;
   two containers (orchestrator+user processes,
   llama.
  cpp),
   path-based routing (`/u/<user-id>/`),
   named volumes for user data

## Screens

### Inbox

Two collapsible sections:

**Suggested** (top):
AI-curated task recommendations filtered by two axes:

- **My location**:
   Autodetect or user-pinned places (e.g.,
   "Walmart").
   Tasks with matching `where` values surface here.
- **My focus**:
   Free-text directive to the AI (e.g.,
   "Adulting tasks first").
   Guides suggestion ranking.

**All** (bottom):
Full task list,
 unfiltered.

### In progress

Live dashboard of tasks the user has started tracking.
All active timers increment in real time on the client using `setInterval(1s)` math against the server-provided `timerStartedAt` timestamp;
 no polling or SSE needed for display.
Tasks blocked by other tasks are **not shown in Suggestions or All**;
 they appear only nested/indented under the tasks blocking them (in any view where the blocker is visible).
 This makes circular dependencies harmless by design:
 cycled tasks simply vanish from top-level lists.
 Search always returns blocked tasks (with a "blocked" badge) so nothing is truly lost.

### Task details (overlay)

Opened from any task card.
 Contains:

- **Title**:
   Editable text field
- **Description**:
   Multi-line text area
- **Attachments**:
   "Attach file" and "Take photo" buttons
- **Metadata chips** (all tappable to edit):
  - `#tag1,tag2`:
     Comma-separated tags (OR semantics)
  - `tracked: Xs`:
     Cumulative tracked time
  - `where: Place1,Place2`:
     Comma-separated locations (OR semantics:
     task can be done at any listed place)
  - `priority: ?`:
     User-set or AI-suggested
  - `due: ?`:
     Due date
  - `complexity: low|medium|high`:
     AI-suggested or user-set
  - `reminders: None|...`:
     Reminder configuration
  - `blockedBy: none|Task(s)`:
     Blocking dependencies;
     tappable to select blocker tasks
- **Save** button

### Search (overlay)

Full-text search across tasks.
Two states:
 initial (empty query,
 recent/popular) and filtered (results matching query).

### Settings

- **AI model selection** (from models available on the llama.
  cpp instance)
- **Connected apps**:
   System calendar,
   GitHub,
   Linear,
   codebase TODO scanner
- Each connector shows sync status and read/write capability

### Drawer

Navigation menu:
 Inbox,
 In Progress,
 Settings.

### Notification shade

System-level notification display (not implemented in app:
 defers to OS/browser push notifications via PWA).

## Email notifications (via `@upyo/smtp`)

All email (verification,
 reminders,
 backups) goes through a generic SMTP transport configured by the operator.
If the SMTP provider has issues,
 that's the provider's problem;
 the app fires and forgets.

### Reminder emails

When a task has reminders configured,
 the server sends an email at the scheduled time.
This is the primary notification mechanism:
 more reliable than browser push since the app may be suspended.

### Daily database backup email

Once daily,
 the server exports the user's task data as JSON and emails it to them.
Attachment BLOBs (photos,
 files) are **excluded** from the backup email to stay within SMTP size limits.
The raw `.db` file is also excluded for the same reason:
 only the JSON export (tasks,
 settings,
 attachment metadata) is sent.
This is a caution-first data safety measure;
 if the instance dies,
 the user has a recent export.

## Task model

```text
Task {
  id: string (ULID)
  title: string
  description: string | null
  tags: string[]                    -- OR semantics
  locations: string[]               -- OR semantics; if AND is needed, AI suggests splitting into dependent tasks
  priority: "low" | "medium" | "high" | null
  dueDate: ISO8601 | null
  complexity: "low" | "medium" | "high" | null
  reminders: Reminder[]
  blockedBy: TaskId[]               -- task cannot be completed until all blockers are done
  trackedTime: number               -- cumulative seconds
  timerStartedAt: ISO8601 | null    -- non-null means timer is running (server-side)
  attachments: Attachment[]
  status: "inbox" | "in_progress" | "done"
  createdAt: ISO8601
  updatedAt: ISO8601
  source: "local" | "github" | "linear" | "calendar" | "codebase"
  sourceId: string | null           -- external ID for sync
  sourceMeta: JSON | null           -- lossless round-trip metadata from external source
}
```

### State transitions

- `inbox` -> `in_progress` (user starts tracking)
- `in_progress` -> `inbox` (user stops tracking,
   pauses timer)
- `in_progress` -> `done` (user completes task;
   only if `blockedBy` is empty or all blockers are done)
- `done` -> permanently removed (no archive in MVP)

### Blocking rules

- A task with unresolved blockers cannot transition to `done`.
- Blocked tasks are **hidden from Suggestions and All**:
   they only appear nested under their blockers.
- Search always returns blocked tasks (with a "blocked" badge) so nothing is permanently invisible.
- The task details overlay shows a summary of all blocking tasks when `blockedBy` is non-empty.
- Completing a blocker task automatically unblocks dependents (they reappear in Suggestions/All).
- Circular dependencies are harmless:
   cycled tasks hide from top-level lists;
   the user discovers and fixes them via search.

## AI behavior

### Task creation auto-fill

As the user types a task title,
 the AI infers and pre-fills metadata:

- "Buy milk from Walmart" -> `#shopping`,
   `where: Walmart`,
   `complexity: low`
- "Review PR #42 on the auth service" -> `#code-review`,
   `complexity: medium`

### Suggestion engine

The `/suggested` section in Inbox uses the AI to rank tasks based on:

1. **Location context**:
    User's current or pinned location vs task `where` values
2. **Focus directive**:
    User's free-text instruction (e.g.,
    "Adulting tasks first")
3. **Task metadata**:
    Priority,
    due date,
    complexity,
    blocking status

Blocked tasks are excluded from suggestions (they only appear nested under their blockers).

### Task splitting

When a task has multiple locations with AND semantics (needs to visit place A then place B),
 the AI suggests breaking it into sequential dependent tasks where each later task is blocked by the previous one.

## Connected apps (sync)

Lossless two-way auto-sync with external sources.
External metadata is preserved in `sourceMeta` for round-trip fidelity.

### MVP sync target: GitHub

- Issues map to tasks
- Labels map to tags
- Issue status maps to task status
- Issue dependencies (if present) map to `blockedBy`
- Closing a task can close the GitHub issue (and vice versa)

### Codebase TODO sync (read-only inbound for MVP)

Scan TODO/FIXME/HACK comments from configured repos and import them as tasks.
Outbound writes (modifying source files) are deferred post-competition;
 too risky to auto-edit a user's codebase in week 1.

- **Inbound**:
   Parse `TODO`,
   `FIXME`,
   `HACK` comments from configured repos/directories.
   Create tasks with file path,
   line number,
   and surrounding context in description.
   `source: "codebase"`,
   `sourceId` encodes `repo:file:line`.
- **Re-scan**:
   Periodic or webhook-triggered re-scan detects new TODOs,
   resolved TODOs (comment removed externally -> task marked done),
   and moved TODOs (file/line changed -> `sourceId` updated).
- **Outbound (post-competition)**:
   When a task sourced from a TODO is completed,
   the sync engine removes or updates the comment in the codebase.
   Deferred because auto-modifying source files is high-risk.

### Planned sync targets

- **Linear**:
   Issues,
   status,
   dependencies
- **System calendar**:
   Events become time-bound tasks

## Timer architecture

The server is the authority for start/stop events;
 the client handles smooth display:

- Starting a timer:
   server sets `timerStartedAt` to current UTC timestamp,
   returns it to client
- Stopping a timer:
   server computes elapsed delta,
   adds to `trackedTime`,
   nulls `timerStartedAt`
- **Client-side display**:
   `setInterval(1000)` computes `trackedTime + (Date.now() - Date.parse(timerStartedAt)) / 1000`:
   purely local math,
   no network per tick
- Cross-device consistency:
   any device that opens In Progress gets the authoritative `timerStartedAt` from the server and ticks locally from there
- No SSE or polling needed for timer display;
   server is only contacted on user actions (start/stop/complete)

## PWA requirements

- Installable (`manifest.json` with icons)
- Service worker caches static assets (JS,
   CSS,
   icons) for faster repeat loads;
   not a full offline mode
- When offline,
   show a clear "offline" banner;
   all pages and actions require connectivity since everything is server-rendered
- Camera access for "Take photo" attachment
- Geolocation API for location autodetect

## Architecture notes

### h3 server on Node

Each user's instance is a single Node process running an h3 server.
The server handles HTML page routes and REST API routes under `/api/...`.
Client pages use vanilla TypeScript bundles,
 read server-embedded JSON,
 and perform mutations through API handlers.
The orchestrator reverse-proxies `done.app/u/<user-id>/*` to the user's h3 port,
 stripping the `/u/<user-id>` prefix before the request reaches the app.

### AI rate limiting

Each Node process enforces a simple in-memory rate limit on AI proxy calls (e.g.,
 30 requests/minute) to prevent runaway loops from overwhelming the shared llama.
cpp instance.

### Docker Compose deployment (Coolify)

The entire stack ships as a `docker-compose.yml` deployable on Coolify.
Coolify's own reverse proxy handles HTTPS termination;
 the orchestrator only listens on HTTP.
Two services:

1. **orchestrator**:
    Node image with the h3 Done app and orchestrator code.
    Listens on port 3000 (HTTP).
    Handles registration,
    login,
    session validation,
    path ACL enforcement,
    and HTTP reverse proxy to user processes.
    Spawns per-user Node processes as child processes within the same container.
2. **llama-cpp**:
    CPU-only `ghcr.io/ggml-org/llama.cpp:server` image.
    Shared AI inference for all users.

Named volumes:

- `done-data`:
   `/data/<user-id>/done.db` per user (mounted in orchestrator)
- `llama-models`:
   Cached model files at `/root/.cache/llama.cpp` (persists auto-downloaded models across container restarts)

Environment variables (configured in Coolify):

- `DOMAIN`:
   Public domain (e.g.,
   `done.app`)
- `SMTP_HOST`,
   `SMTP_PORT`,
   `SMTP_USER`,
   `SMTP_PASS`,
   `SMTP_FROM`:
   SMTP provider credentials
- `CHAT_COMPLETIONS_URL`:
   Full URL for llama.
  cpp's OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoint (defaults to `http://llama-cpp:8080/v1/chat/completions`)
- `PORT_RANGE_START`,
   `PORT_RANGE_END`:
   Port range for user processes (e.g.,
   3100-3999)

### FTS5 rowid note

libsql uses TEXT primary keys (ULIDs),
 so `rowid` is SQLite's implicit auto-assigned integer,
 not the ULID.
FTS5 search queries JOIN on `tasks.rowid`,
 not `tasks.id`.
 This is correct but easy to confuse;
 be careful in implementation.
