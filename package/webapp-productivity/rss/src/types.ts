/**
 * Shared structural type helpers for the RSS pipeline.

/**
 * Recursively marks every property and array element of `T` readonly.
 *
 * only when it is deeply readonly. The feed, outline, and item values this
 * package threads through its pipeline are plain parsed data, so a homomorphic
 * deep map describes them without dropping any field the renderers read;
 * passing a mutable value into a `DeepReadonly`-typed parameter is sound
 * because every consumer only reads. `Date` short-circuits first so its
 * instance methods stay callable and the rule's allow-list still recognises
 * it; the function branch (contravariant `never[]` matches any signature,
 * including methods carrying typed parameters such as `Dirent.isFile`)
 * preserves callable members instead of mangling them into property bags.
 *
 * @typeParam T - value type to deeply freeze at the type level
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * function render(items: readonly DeepReadonly<Item>[]): string { ... }
 * ```
