 Randomness primitives.

 Every draw comes from `crypto.getRandomValues` or `crypto.randomUUID`, both

 which is not cryptographically secure, so this is a deliberate strengthening
 rather than a behaviour port; the observable charset and lengths are
 unchanged.

 Both draws use rejection sampling, because reducing a uniform source modulo a
 size that does not divide it over-represents the low values.
