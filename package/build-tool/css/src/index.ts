/**
 * CSS build tool: monorepo-aware `\@import` bundling plus `\@mixin`/`\@apply`
 * expansion over the byte-preserving css-edit CST.
 *
 * Two entry points:
 * - {@link buildCss}: file pipeline (read, inline imports, expand mixins, write).
 * - {@link expandCssMixins}: pure text pipeline for in-memory CSS
 *   (Shadow DOM styles in the browser); no filesystem, no process globals.
 *
 * Browser bundles must import `expandCssMixins` from
 * `\@monochromatic-dev/build-tool-css/ts/expand` directly: this index also
 * re-exports the node-only file pipeline, whose path utilities would pull
 * node builtins into a client bundle.
 *
