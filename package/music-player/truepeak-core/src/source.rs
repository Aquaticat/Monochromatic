//! The decoded-audio source contract and the `AudioSpec` describing a stream.
//!
//! Stage one keeps decoding in the platform crates: each flavor opens a file with its
//! own decoder and hands the shared core an implementation of [`TruePeakSource`] over
//! interleaved `f32` PCM. The desktop and Android `Source` traits are already this
//! shape, except seeking: this trait seeks by FRAME, not seconds, because reproducible
//! window placement needs the runtime and the bench sidecar to land on the same frame.

/// What:     `use crate::error::TruePeakError;`. The crate-owned error the fallible
///           methods return. `crate::` means the root of this crate.
/// Why:      `next_chunk` and `seek_to_frame` return `Result<_, TruePeakError>`.

///           decoded stream: sample rate, channel count, and track length.
