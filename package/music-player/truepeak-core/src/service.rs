//! The cache-aware resolve that composes the cache and the resolver (service feature).
//!
//! This is the one call both the foreground current track and the background warming loop
//! make: return the cached decision, or open the source, resolve it under the policy, store
//! the result, and return it. The opener is invoked only on a miss, so a cache hit never
//! decodes. The platform still owns concurrency, priority, and cancellation; this is only the
//! per-track get-or-resolve, which the platform drives in whatever loop it likes.

/// What:     `use crate::cache::{CacheError, DecisionCache};`. The cache handle and its error.
/// Why:      This reads and writes through the cache.

/// import { CacheError, DecisionCache } from "./cache";
/// ```

/// ```ts
/// import { Decision } from "./decision";
