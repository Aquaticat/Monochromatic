//! The shared Catmull-Rom true-peak meter.
//!
//! This is the one measurement unit that makes full-scan peaks and window-probe peaks
//! comparable: both feed the SAME meter. It reads decoded interleaved `f32` PCM,
//! keeps a four-sample sliding window per channel, and once a channel has four real
//! samples it samples the reconstructed curve at one quarter, one half, and three
//! quarters between the two middle samples, tracking the largest magnitude. The gain
//! math that turns the measured peak into a normalization gain lives in `gain.rs`.

/// What:     `const HALF: f32 = 1.0 / 2.0;`. The fraction one-half. Composed from the
///           always-allowed `-2..=2` range rather than written as a bare `0.5`
///           literal. `f32` (sibling `f64`) to match the PCM sample type.
/// Why:      Used as the Catmull-Rom 1/2 scale factor and to build the sample offsets
///           below; the repo bans bare fractional literals, so it is composed.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// const HALF = 1 / 2;
/// ```
const HALF: f32 = 1.0 / 2.0;

/// What:     `const QUARTER: f32 = HALF / 2.0;`. One-quarter (0.25), built from HALF.
///           `f32` (sibling `f64`) to match the sample type.
/// Why:      The first of three interior sample positions between two samples.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// const QUARTER = HALF / 2;
/// ```
const QUARTER: f32 = HALF / 2.0;

/// What:     `const THREE_QUARTERS: f32 = HALF + QUARTER;`. Three-quarters (0.75).
///           `f32` (sibling `f64`) to match the sample type.
/// Why:      The third interior sample position.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):

/// What:     `const WINDOW: usize = 4;`. Number of consecutive samples the cubic
///           interpolation needs (two on each side of the interval it fills). `usize`
