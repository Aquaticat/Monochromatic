//! The decided policy: a proportional-coverage probe with a fixed margin, plus the
//! margin-versus-clamp tradeoff.
//!
//! A fixed-length probe under-covers long tracks (a 45s probe is ~1% of an hour-long mix),
//! so the worst under-read is a long track. Proportional coverage instead probes a fixed
//! fraction of every long track, giving uniform coverage. The under-read distribution is
//! extremely skewed (median near 0.14 dB), so guaranteeing the last percent costs about a
//! decibel of margin on every track. The margin is therefore a decision: a smaller margin
//! keeps most tracks louder and lets the realtime clamp catch the rare too-loud transient,
//! which background warming later corrects to an exact cached gain.
