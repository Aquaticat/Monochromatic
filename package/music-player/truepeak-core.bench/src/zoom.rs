//! The quarter-measure answer's probe: an even pass plus frontier zoom.
//!
//! The under-read of an evenly-placed probe is governed by how many bins sit near the
//! track's crest; the clamp tail is tracks where that count is one or two (needles).
//! Zooming cannot find a needle, but it climbs every heard hill: after a sparse even
//! pass, repeatedly decode the undecoded neighbors of the loudest decoded bin until the
//! track's bin budget is spent. That collapses the mid-tail (p90 under-read 0.63 -> 0.36
//! at the full quarter budget), so a much smaller margin buys the same clamp count and
//! every track keeps more loudness. Byte-rate profiles from container framing were also
//! measured as a needle locator and refuted (crest slots rank at the 60th byte-rank
//! percentile, worse than chance), so the probe stays purely decode-driven.
