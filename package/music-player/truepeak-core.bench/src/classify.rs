//! A small, auditable probe-only classifier that routes risky long tracks to a full
//! scan.
//!
//! The prior search treated violators as an opaque exception list. This is the better
//! model the plan asks for: a two-feature decision rule over probe-only features. A
//! probe under-reads the true peak when a peak hides between the windows, which happens
//! on tracks whose loudest window is not very loud, or whose windows disagree a lot. So
//! the rule routes a long track to a full scan when the loudest sampled window is at or
//! below a cutoff, OR the spread between the loudest and quietest window is at or above a
//! cutoff. The fit finds the cutoffs that catch every actual violator (full recall) while
//! routing the fewest non-violators, and it falls back to the one-feature rule when the
//! spread escape buys nothing. The labels use the full true peak, which is legal in the
//! harness; the shipped rule reads only probe features.
