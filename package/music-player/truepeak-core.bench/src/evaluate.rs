//! Scoring a window policy against the corpus with the shared truepeak-core math.
//!
//! For one candidate `(window_count, window_seconds, probe_margin_db)` this simulates
//! the short/long split, the probe windows (placed by `truepeak_core::WindowPlacement`
//! and read from the per-second bins), the probe and exact gains (`truepeak_core` gain
//! math), the gain error against the bounds, and the decoded-seconds cost under the
//! plan's amended accounting (a probe-then-full track pays both the probe and the full
//! scan). A long track whose probe gain leaves the `+0.5 / -2.0 dB` bounds is a
//! violator the classifier must route to a full scan.
