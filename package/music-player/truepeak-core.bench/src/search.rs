//! The corrected-target parameter search over candidate window policies.
//!
//! This is deliberately more than the prior margin-sweep. The objective is the decided
//! one: among policies that keep every track inside the bounds and stay under the
//! decoded-seconds budget, minimize the worst-case too-quiet error first, then prefer
//! the simplest classifier. Because a probe never over-reads the true peak, with a
//! margin at or below the too-quiet bound the only failures are too-loud under-reads,
//! so the worst too-quiet error equals the margin and the search drives the margin down
//! until the violators it must full-scan would exceed the budget.
