# truepeak-core-bench

Corpus evaluation and corrected-target parameter search for the shared true-peak policy.

This is Stage two of the shared true-peak plan:
 durable,
 reproducible evidence built on
the production [`truepeak-core`](../truepeak-core) meter,
 gain,
 window-placement,
 and
policy math,
 so the benchmark cannot diverge from what playback runs.

## What it does

It reads a per-track measurement corpus (`tracks.jsonl`) where each line is one track
measured by the shared meter:
 the full true peak and per-second bin peaks.
 Because the
bins are exact per-second meter peaks,
 any window policy can be simulated by re-slicing
them,
 so the search never re-decodes audio.

For a candidate policy `(window_count, window_seconds, probe_margin_db)` it:

- splits tracks into short (exact full scan) and long (probe),
- places the probe windows with `truepeak_core::WindowPlacement` and reads the bins they
  cover,
- computes the probe and exact gains with the shared gain math,
- scores the gain error against the `+0.5 / -2.0 dB` bounds,
- sums the decoded-seconds cost under the plan's amended accounting (a probe-then-full
  track pays both the probe and the full scan),
- ranks candidates by the decided objective:
   loudest-safe (least worst-case too-quiet)
  first,
   then simplest classifier.

It then prints the feature distributions of violators versus non-violators,
 fits a
probe-only full-scan classifier,
 and writes a per-track feature dump
(`out/long_features.jsonl`) so a metadata-aware classifier can be evaluated offline by
joining on the track path.

## Run

```sh
# The corpus is produced by the collector (truepeak-core-collect); it is not committed.
# The classifier-era sweep (historical exploration):
mise run //package/music-player/truepeak-core.bench:run -- /path/to/tracks.jsonl
# The decided policy on the fine corpus, with optional provenance metadata:
mise run //package/music-player/truepeak-core.bench:run -- /path/to/tracks-fine.jsonl /path/to/metadata.jsonl --proportional
```

The target is computed from the corpus as `total decodable seconds / 4`,
 the corrected
quarter-library benchmark target.

## Findings

The full exploration and its evidence live in the plan's Stage-two section.
 The decided policy
is proportional coverage plus a fixed margin,
 with no classifier:

- A fixed-length probe under-covers long tracks,
 so coverage FRACTION,
 not window granularity,
  is the lever.
 A handful of tracks hide a sub-tenth-second transient no sparse probe catches,
  so guaranteeing exact fit costs about a decibel of margin on every track.
- The under-read distribution is extremely skewed (median near `0.14 dB`),
 so the shipped
  policy probes a fifth of each long track and applies a fixed `0.8 dB` margin:
 about
  ninety-nine percent of tracks stay within `-0.8 dB`,
 and the rest clamp on cold start until
  warming corrects them.
 `--proportional` reproduces these numbers on the fine corpus.
- Provenance metadata (lossless or yt-dlp) never mislabels a hard track as safe,
 so it lowers
  the average error;
 amplitude and probe-window statistics do not separate the hard tracks,
  because their peaks live in unsampled gaps.

## Tasks

Run with `mise run //package/music-player/truepeak-core.bench:<task>`.

- `build`:
   compile the bench.
- `run`:
   evaluate and search a corpus (pass the `tracks.jsonl` path after `--`).
- `lint`,
   `lint:clippy`,
   `lint:rust`:
   the checks.
