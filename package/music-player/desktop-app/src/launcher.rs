//! Desktop-shell integration: the Wayland app id and the KDE taskbar progress.
//!
//! Two small concerns share one identifier (`APP_ID`), so they live together:
//!
//! - `set_window_app_id` is a winit window-attributes hook that stamps the
//!   Wayland app id onto the window at creation. KDE matches a running window to
//!   a `.desktop` file by that id, which is how the progress badge finds the
//!   window. app id can only be set at creation (it is an `xdg_toplevel`
//!   property), so this must run via the backend hook, not after the fact.
//! - `Launcher` emits the `com.canonical.Unity.LauncherEntry` `Update` signal on
//!   the session bus, the de-facto Linux protocol for taskbar progress (KDE
//!   Plasma supports it natively; GNOME needs Dash-to-Dock). The `appUri` names
//!   the same `.desktop` file, and the body carries `progress` (0..1) and
//!   `progress-visible`.
//!
//! Everything is best-effort: with no session bus (or a shell that ignores the
//! protocol) the signal is silently dropped and playback is unaffected.

/// What:     `use std::collections::HashMap;`. The owned hash-map type. Sibling:
///           `BTreeMap` (sorted by key). Used for the signal's `a{sv}` property dict.
/// Why:      zvariant serializes `HashMap<&str, Value>` as the D-Bus `a{sv}` the
///           LauncherEntry `Update` body needs (key order does not matter, so a hash
///           map, not the sorted `BTreeMap`).
