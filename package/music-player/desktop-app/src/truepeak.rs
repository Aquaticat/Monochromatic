//! Desktop true-peak resolution: a thin adapter that drives the shared policy resolver.
//!
//! "True peak" (a.k.a. inter-sample peak) is the highest level the analog waveform reaches
//! AFTER a DAC reconstructs it between the stored samples; it can sit above the largest
//! stored sample. The measurement policy (full-scan short tracks, probe long ones), the
//! Catmull-Rom meter, the attenuate-only gain, the window placement, and the decision cache
//! now all live once in the shared `truepeak-core` crate. This module keeps only the
//! desktop-specific glue: a [`TruePeakSource`] adapter over the desktop `decode::Source`, and
//! two openers that hand that adapter to the shared resolvers. Foreground playback resolves a
//! probe-or-full decision quickly ([`resolve_current`]); background warming upgrades to an
//! exact full scan ([`resolve_full`]). See
//! ../../../doc/handover/music-player-truepeak-core-integration.md.

/// What:     `use std::path::Path;`. Borrowed filesystem-path type (sibling: the owned
///           `PathBuf`, like `&str` vs `String`).
/// Why:      The openers only read the path, so they borrow it.
