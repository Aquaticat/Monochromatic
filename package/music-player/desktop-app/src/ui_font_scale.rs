//! Scales every UI font to 0.9x the OS UI font while still tracking the OS setting.
//!
//! Every font in the window is a rem multiple of the window `default-font-size`: the
//! hand-drawn Text (`Typography.body-rem * 1rem`) and the native std-widgets
//! (Button / CheckBox / Slider), whose only font-size lever is that base. So one
//! knob, `default-font-size`, scales all of them at once. To shrink them 10% while
//! still honouring the OS UI-font preference we set the base to `0.9 * the OS font`.
//!
//! A relative `default-font-size: 0.9rem` in `.slint` is rejected as a binding loop
//! (rem resolves against this very property), so the 0.9 is applied from here. Slint
//! reads the OS font from the desktop portal ASYNCHRONOUSLY
//! (i-slint-backend-winit `xdg_desktop_settings.rs`), so it is the fallback at window
//! creation and only becomes real once the portal answers, which flips the `.slint`
//! `os-font-size` (= 1rem) and fires the `probe-os-font` callback wired below.
//! See `doc/troubleshooting/slint-rem-binding-loop.md`.

/// What:     `use crate::AppWindow;`. The generated Slint window type, which only
///           exists in this binary crate (same as the sibling `ui_page` module).
/// Why:      The scale handler reads and writes this window's generated properties
///           and callback.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// import { AppWindow } from "./main";
/// ```
use crate::AppWindow;

/// What:     `use slint::ComponentHandle;`. The trait that provides `.as_weak()` on a
///           generated component handle.
/// Why:      We capture a WEAK handle in the callback so it does not keep the window
///           alive, then `upgrade()` it back on the UI thread when the callback fires.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// import { ComponentHandle } from "slint";
/// ```
use slint::ComponentHandle;

/// What:     `pub(crate) fn apply_os_font_scale(app: &AppWindow)`. Registers the
///           `probe-os-font` callback that the `.slint` `changed os-font-size` fires,
///           and on the first real value sets `base-font-size` to `0.9 * os_px`.
///           `Cell::new(false)` is a single-threaded flag (all of this runs on the UI
///           thread, so no `Mutex`); the `move` closure owns it plus a weak handle.
/// Why:      Slint delivers the OS font asynchronously (portal), so we cannot read it
///           at window creation; the callback fires once the real value lands. The
///           `applied` guard makes it a one-shot: setting `base-font-size` feeds back
///           into `os-font-size` and would re-fire the callback, so the guard stops a
///           runaway (the same self-reference that makes a `.slint` `0.9rem` a binding
///           loop). `changed` fires on change, not on the initial value, so a portal
///           that already answered before first evaluation (rare, it is async) leaves
///           the OS size unscaled rather than looping. `0.9` is the 10% reduction.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// function applyOsFontScale(app: AppWindow): void {
///   let applied = false;
///   app.onProbeOsFont((osPx) => {
///     if (applied || osPx <= 0) return;
///     applied = true;
///     app.baseFontSize = osPx * 0.9;
///   });
/// }
/// ```
