# Pixel 9 Pro Fold Search result-name and list-overflow study

## Design-only fixture

The accepted Search A keeps an integrated Back/query/Clear header,
results on the right inner pane,
and the same upper-left folder browser above the bottom-left deck.
The cover uses one full-width Search page.
A debug-only result-data stress candidate on prototype commit `c7e0552ee`
uses a spaced synthetic folder title,
an unbroken synthetic track title,
a longer secondary description and additional folder rows.
The tested APK SHA-256 is
`989346cd9b7dde18dbec03255368f6aa4e1fb2744828e04e4ecd4c8bddfabc10`.
It changes no production Search result source or ranking.

The private `Fold_No_Hardware_Probe` AVD was unfolded or folded using its
measured device states at 390dpi and 200% text.
Android UI Automator hierarchies and native-panel PNGs remained in private
scratch because their system status content was not sanitized.
The source variants are
`search-deck-right-lift-retain-overflow-results-light` for the inner panel
and its delegated `search-layout-docked-results-overflow-light` cover form.
A same-APK plain-A control retained `Folders`,
Open,
`cam`,
the complete deck and the ordinary short result titles before the stress
candidate was opened.

## Inner panel at 200% text

With the keyboard closed,
the long spaced folder name wrapped within right-side text bounds
`[1220,338][2037,956]`.
The unbroken track name wrapped by character within
`[1220,1095][2037,2022]` rather than widening into the approximate
x `[983,1093)` crease.
The large first rows push other matches lower in the list,
so vertical scrolling remains part of the result experience.
After scrolling,
the final synthetic `Camellia archive 18` label was fully visible at
`[1220,1856][1858,1959]` while the left browser and mode bounds remained
unchanged.

The 300dp system-managed **debug IME** began at y `1421`;
this is not a real-Gboard pass.
With `cam` focused,
the same left browser remained visible and the final mode occupied
`[73,1270][965,1401]` above that IME.
Independent right-list swipes then brought the last result to
`[1220,1203][1858,1306]` above the IME,
without moving the browser or deck.
This tests result scrolling in the selected A composition,
not activation or ranking.

## Folded cover at 200% text

With the keyboard closed,
the long spaced folder title occupied `[127,350][993,865]` and the
unbroken track title `[127,996][993,1923]`.
The final synthetic folder row was reachable at `[127,2151][765,2254]`
after scrolling,
above the screen's navigation region.

A visible 300dp debug IME began at y `1693` after focusing `cam`.
At the cover list's maximum downward scroll,
`Camellia archive 18` still occupied `[127,2151][765,2254]`,
**behind** that bottom keyboard.
A reverse swipe visibly moved the list back to earlier rows,
so the failure was not an unresponsive gesture;
returning to the scroll end still left the last rows behind the IME.
The physical cover screenshot showed the list cut at the keyboard top,
with only results through `Camellia archive 15` readable in that sample.
`SearchLayoutStudy.kt` currently gives cover results a vertically scrolling
column with navigation-bar padding but no keyboard-height reservation.
This is a **debug-prototype viewport finding**,
not a claim about production Search (which is not yet implemented).
D55 accepts results obscured by **floating real Gboard**,
not these results hidden behind an ordinary bottom-aligned keyboard.

## Opt-in cover viewport comparison at 200% text

Prototype commits `f4a35e817` and `c4cf948e4` add a **separate,
unaccepted** `-imeviewport-` comparison to the selected Search candidate.
The selected Search cover delegation keeps the positive-heading suppression,
so the first result still begins directly beneath the integrated header.
Only the cover result viewport receives Compose `imePadding()`;
Back,
query and Clear remain in the fixed header.
The [Android Compose insets guide][compose-insets] describes keyboard inset
padding as resizing scrollable content during IME changes and consuming
nested system-bar insets.
That describes the intended API behavior,
not a substitute for the rendered device check.

The newly built and installed debug APK matched SHA-256
`0801ea3f44ef84163cbddb2b2f37fbddbb1c293148440381f6f899be7eaee7af`.
On the disposable folded 1080 × 2424 panel at 390dpi and 200% text,
its keyboard-closed result viewport was `[0,330][1080,2365]` and the
first long title started at y `350` with **no heading**.
After the query took focus,
the 300dp debug keyboard began at y `1693`;
the viewport ended at that same y instead of continuing behind it.
A within-list upward swipe visibly moved row 1 from y `2236` to y `1246`,
validating that this fixture responds to scrolling.
At the bottom,
`Camellia archive 18` occupied `[127,1479][765,1582]` and its supporting
text occupied `[127,1582][847,1673]`,
both above the keyboard.
A further upward swipe left row 18 at exactly the same bounds.
The native 1080 × 2424 screenshot showed the complete last title,
its folder icon and supporting copy immediately above the debug keyboard.
A first explicit screenshot inadvertently targeted the black **inactive
inner** display;
the verified cover capture used display ID `4619827551948147201`.
These controls support a **settled 200% debug-IME viewport pass**,
not a real-Gboard or frame-transition pass.
The APK's signing certificate differed from the prior installed debug APK;
only the disposable AVD's app was uninstalled and reinstalled before this
same-hash comparison.

## Same-APK controls and other settled keyboard states

The **opt-out** cover candidate on that installed APK kept the result list
at `[0,330][1080,2365]` while the debug IME visibly began at y `1693`.
A swipe moved row 1 upward from y `2236` to y `1263`;
after scrolling to the end,
row 18 stayed at `[127,2151][765,2254]` after another within-list swipe.
The native cover screenshot showed results through row 15 above the dark
keyboard,
with rows 16 to 18 unavailable until the keyboard was hidden.
Thus the opt-in candidate's smaller viewport has a same-binary,
same-data failure control,
not merely a comparison against an older build.

At **100% text**,
the opt-in cover viewport again ended at y `1693` under the debug IME.
Its last row title was `[127,1542][487,1601]` and supporting text
`[127,1601][513,1650]`;
the screenshot showed both above the input surface.
At 200%,
hiding the keyboard expanded the viewport to y `2365` and moved
row 18 to y `[2151,2254]`;
refocusing shrank the viewport again,
and a further list swipe returned the last title and support text above
that keyboard.
Refocus did **not** automatically preserve the last row's visible position;
continued scrolling recovered it.

With **real settled full-width Gboard** on the cover,
the opt-in viewport ended at y `1605` at both 100% and 200% text.
After scrolling,
row 18 and its support text occupied y `[1454,1513]` and
`[1513,1562]` at 100%,
then `[1394,1497]` and `[1497,1588]` at 200%.
Both physical-panel screenshots showed the complete final row above Gboard.
A real `m` key tap changed `cam` to `camm`,
proving the query field still accepts keyboard input;
the debug fixture deliberately shows results **only for exactly `cam`**,
so the resulting empty state does not test real search filtering or ranking.

On the **inner** panel,
the opt-in marker did not alter the selected A branch.
At 100%/200% text,
the spaced and unbroken stress titles remained bounded to x
`[1220,2037]`,
while Folders,
Open,
the actual folder browser,
the full bottom-left deck and the right query remained in their selected
positions in the captured closed states.
At 100% with the debug IME beginning at y `1421`,
right-side scrolling exposed row 18 at y `[1270,1329]` and its support
text at `[1329,1378]` while the browser and the complete deck stayed
visible.
At 200% with **real floating Gboard**,
the key surface still obscured parts of right-pane result labels as well
as the D53-exempt deck.
The right-pane overlap is a **separate open decision** (#122),
not an implied extension of D53 or the accepted D55 folded-cover case.
A settled real split-keyboard test on this stress fixture was **not**
performed;
the earlier split-keyboard findings used short sample results.

These captures support wrapping,
scrollability and the opt-in cover viewport in the named **settled** states.
They do not test the IME animation's intermediate frames,
all keyboard heights,
result activation,
ranking or accessibility.
The inner text-node boxes stay to the right of the approximate crease x
`[983,1093)` in the inspected stress states;
the screenshots visibly preserve an unlettered central band,
but neither measurement certifies every glyph-ink edge or E2's open
numeric `min_padding`.
The cover viewport comparison is **not adopted** for production or inserted
into the accepted A review.
Raw status-bearing screenshots and hierarchies remain private.

## Historical R/C review and D56 selection

`package/music-player/design/questions/cover-viewport-review.html` compares the
same-APK 200% opt-out failure control with the opt-in end-of-list state;
it does not replace the selected A review.
Its public captures are `questions/render/search-cover-viewport-control-s200.png`
and `questions/render/search-cover-viewport-refinement-s200.png`.
Every pixel in the top 151px status strip was replaced with the same
visually checked generic 9:41 clock and signal/battery icon strip from the
previously published selected-cover review.
The source-to-public pixel difference below that strip was exactly zero in
both captures;
no PNG text,
profile,
EXIF or timestamp chunks remained.
The reference strip itself contains no notification or account text.
The user answered **R**,
selecting the cover-only keyboard-aware results viewport as D56.
The R/C comparison remains historical evidence;
`questions/current.html` presents only the active design.
Refocus position,
Back/Clear/focus,
ranking/actions and TalkBack traversal remain open.
This selection does not authorize production implementation.

## Inner floating-result exception question

`package/music-player/design/questions/floating-results-review.html` shows a
separate sanitized 2076 × 2152 native inner-panel capture from the same
long-results debug fixture with **real floating Gboard**.
Its middle right-pane result labels are partially covered while the `cam`
query remains visible;
later results are visible below the floating keyboard.
The entire top 136px status strip was replaced from an already published
selected-A capture with generic 9:41 and status icons.
All app pixels beneath the status strip match the private capture exactly;
PNG text,
profile,
EXIF and timestamp chunks were removed.
The form asks whether to accept this **specific** floating overlay or require
legible matches beneath all floating placements;
it does not claim that a solution for the latter has been built.
D53 concerns the separately accepted deck overlap,
and D55 concerns the folded cover.
The inner result question remains open until the user answers;
no additional IME experiment was performed for this artifact.
