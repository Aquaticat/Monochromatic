# Material 3 compliance for the theme questionnaire

## Source and scope

The source is the user-supplied SingleFile archive at
`/var/home/user/Downloads/m3.material.io/`.
Its `manifest.json` identifies `https://m3.material.io/` as the original URL and
records an archive time of 2026-09-03T12:22:11.605Z.
The archive is a primary Google source.

This audit covers every guideline applicable to the UI visible in the six theme
questionnaire captures:
 adaptive layout,
 panes,
 app bars,
 lists,
 buttons,
 icon buttons,
segmented buttons,
 sliders,
 icons,
 color,
 type,
 spacing,
 bidirectionality,
 system safety
regions,
 touch targets,
 focus,
 labels,
 text resizing,
 and truncation.
Guidance for components absent from the captures does not apply to this round.

The project stays on baseline Material 3 under decision A2.
The archive explicitly says baseline lists,
 app bars,
 icon buttons,
 and segmented
buttons remain available even where Material 3 Expressive recommends newer variants.
The questionnaire must therefore satisfy baseline component guidance without silently
switching the product to Material 3 Expressive.

## Violations in prototype commit `6e8f248c5`

### Adaptive layout and scaffold

- `FullUnfoldedStudy` uses a 16dp pane spacer.
   The archived expanded-breakpoint page
  specifies 24dp leading and trailing margins and a 24dp spacer between panes at
  widths from 840dp to 1199dp:
  `foundations/layout/breakpoints/expanded/index.html`.
- The screen width is 852dp,
   so it is expanded and should use a two-pane layout.
  The two-pane choice is correct,
   but its geometry is not:
  `foundations/layout/canonical-examples/list-detail/index.html` and
  `foundations/layout/scaffold/panes/index.html`.
- The pane backgrounds may remain full bleed.
   Actionable content must align to a
  margin or safety ruler,
   and system UI must not cover it:
  `foundations/layout/grids-spacing/grids/index.html` and
  `foundations/layout/scaffold/bars/index.html`.

Correction:
 use a centered 24dp split-pane spacer,
 keep section backgrounds full bleed,
and keep actionable content after the measured system-gesture and system-bar insets.
Use 24dp screen-edge content alignment wherever the larger measured safety inset does
not already exceed it.

### App bars and page identity

- Neither pane has a real app bar.
   Both use hand-built 56dp rows.
- The right row presents `Camellia` as a button rather than as the page title.
- The three-dot glyph is text in a passive `Box`,
   not an icon button.
- The archive requires app bars at the top of a page,
   a contextual title,
   straight
  corners,
   the default height,
   full pane or window width,
   and no more than one action
  unless a second is necessary:
  `components/app-bars/guidelines/index.html` and
  `foundations/layout/scaffold/bars/index.html`.

Correction:
 use Compose `TopAppBar` in both panes.
 Label the list pane `Folders` and
the detail pane `Camellia`.
 Keep one contextual action in each bar.
 Use the real app
bar height,
 color roles,
 typography,
 insets,
 and icon-button behavior supplied by the
Material component.

### Buttons and folder selection

- The prototype uses `Button` with manually supplied tonal colors for both `Open` and
  the current folder.
- `Open` contains a Unicode block instead of an icon.
- A single persistent current-folder control must not be styled as a chip.
   The archive
  says chips appear as a set of contextual options and explicitly says not to display
  a single chip by itself:
  `components/chips/guidelines/index.html`.
- Button labels must remain visible on one line,
   use sentence case,
   and describe the
  action.
   Leading icons must communicate the action:
  `components/buttons/guidelines/index.html`.

Correction:
 remove the redundant current-folder button.
 Use the right-pane app-bar
title and selected plain-text target for current-folder identity.
 Place a real Material
`TextButton` with the official folder-open icon on the left `Folders` app-bar line.
It remains visible with a 48dp target and consumes no separate source-action row.

### Iconography and icon buttons

- `▰`,
   `⋮`,
   `◀`,
   `Ⅱ`,
   `▶`,
   and the selected-row triangle are font glyphs,
   not
  Material icons.
- The transport faces are passive `Surface` nodes,
   not icon buttons.
   They therefore do
  not inherit Material target,
   state,
   ripple,
   focus,
   role,
   or label behavior.
- Google specifies 24dp as the standard icon size,
   a 48dp default target around it,
  consistent icon weight,
   and action-based accessibility labels:
  `styles/icons/designing-icons/index.html`,
  `styles/icons/applying-icons/index.html`,
   and
  `components/icon-buttons/accessibility/index.html`.

Correction:
 use official Material icons in `Icon`,
 `IconButton`,
`FilledIconButton`,
 and `FilledTonalIconButton`.
 Supply action labels such as
`Previous track`,
 `Pause`,
 `Next track`,
 and `Settings`.
 Keep media controls and their
progress direction left-to-right even in an RTL locale,
 as required by
`foundations/layout/bidirectionality-rtl/index.html`.

### Segmented playback mode

- The four choices are drawn as bordered boxes rather than the Compose Material
  component.
- The control wraps into two rows.
   The archive explicitly says segments must not wrap,
  should remain between two and five choices,
   use a 40dp visual container inside a
  48dp target,
   and indicate selection with both color and a checkmark:
  `components/segmented-buttons/guidelines/index.html`,
  `components/segmented-buttons/specs/index.html`,
   and
  `components/segmented-buttons/accessibility/index.html`.

Correction:
 use one `SingleChoiceSegmentedButtonRow` with four `SegmentedButton`
children on one line.
 Keep all labels visible and let the Material component provide
outline,
 selected color,
 checkmark,
 semantics,
 and interaction states.

### Slider

- The real Compose `Slider` is the correct component,
   but the design gives it no
  adjacent time labels and no semantics label.
- The archive says text or icons outside a slider can make its range understandable,
  and its accessibility label should match adjacent UI text:
  `components/sliders/guidelines/index.html` and
  `components/sliders/accessibility/index.html`.

Correction:
 keep the Material slider,
 add elapsed and duration labels with tabular
figures,
 and label it `Track position`.
 Keep the current 16dp track and 4 × 44dp
handle supplied by the current Material component.

### Lists and selection

- Track rows use the correct 72dp baseline height,
   but they are custom passive
  containers rather than selectable list items.
- The selected row uses `secondaryContainer` with default `onSurface` text.
   The
  archived list mapping uses `primaryContainer` with `onPrimaryContainer` for
  selection.
- Folder choices and rail letters have visual 48dp boxes but no selectable behavior,
  role,
   ripple,
   or state semantics.
- Selection is shown by color and weight or shape in some places,
   but the selected
  track's fake play glyph is not a proper icon.
- Track titles are truncated without an available way to reveal the omitted text.
- The archive requires at least 48dp targets,
   ripple and focus behavior,
   a non-color
  selection cue,
   aligned content,
   and accessible label and role behavior.
   It also says
  information must remain available when text is truncated:
  `components/lists/guidelines/index.html`,
  `components/lists/specs/index.html`,
  `components/lists/accessibility/index.html`,
   and
  `foundations/writing/text-truncation/index.html`.

Correction:
 use selectable Material surfaces with proper roles for folder and letter
choices,
 use the baseline `ListItem` with a clickable Material action boundary,
 and use
a 72dp minimum rather than a fixed height so enlarged or long text can grow instead of
being lost.
 The archive maps `primaryContainer` / `onPrimaryContainer` to a selected
list item,
 but D36 distinguishes current playback from user selection:
 all tracks keep
standard list colors and only the current track gains a leading play icon plus semantic
state.
 The baseline `ListItem` overload is deprecated only in favor of the Expressive
list.
 A scoped compiler suppression is required because A2 rejects that migration.

### Color roles

- Most literals happen to resemble baseline colors,
   but the implementation bypasses
  the Android runtime scheme and includes an incorrect hand-entered `#DED8E0` value.
- Selected containers and text use unmatched role pairs.
- The flat candidate uses the important-boundary `outline` role in contexts where the
  archive requires decorative `outlineVariant` dividers.
- The archive requires custom components to map to standard roles,
   preserve intended
  role pairs,
   and keep mappings stable across breakpoints:
  `styles/color/roles/index.html`.
- Project decision A3 requires the Android system accent.
   The archive identifies a
  wallpaper-derived dynamic scheme as the user-generated source and recommends first
  checking role mappings against the baseline scheme:
  `styles/color/choosing-a-scheme/index.html` and
  `styles/color/dynamic/index.html`.

Correction:
 derive the light scheme from Android dynamic color on Android 12 and
newer,
 with the baseline light scheme as fallback.
 Express every candidate difference
through `ColorScheme` roles.
 Use only valid paired foreground and container roles.
Use `outlineVariant` for decorative rail,
 row,
 and pane dividers unless an explicit
product override wins.
 D34 keeps `outlineVariant` on the 1dp rail boundary and makes
the 24dp center spacer plus 16dp picker/transport divider white.

### Type, spacing, resizing, and writing direction

- The prototype manually repeats font sizes and weights rather than applying Material
  typography roles.
- Several text containers have fixed heights that cannot accommodate 200% type.
- Hand-built physical placement makes RTL support accidental,
   while the folder library
  explicitly includes non-Latin writing systems.
- The archive requires type roles,
   approximately 1.5 line height for body and label
  styles,
   a 200% text increase without lost content,
   leading/trailing mirroring,
   and
  spacing selected from the Compose spacing tokens:
  `styles/typography/applying-type/index.html`,
  `styles/typography/type-scale-tokens/index.html`,
  `foundations/writing/text-resizing/index.html`,
  `foundations/layout/bidirectionality-rtl/index.html`,
   and
  `styles/spacing/tokens/index.html`.

Correction:
 use `MaterialTheme.typography` roles,
 logical start/end insets,
 flexible
minimum heights,
 vertical scrolling,
 and Material components whose RTL,
 focus,
 and
state behavior is built in.
 Retain fixed left-to-right direction only for media time
and transport controls,
 where the archive explicitly requires it.
 At a system font
scale of 1.5 or greater,
 reflow the same single-select mode control into four connected
vertical segments with full labels.
 A 200% emulator capture confirms that no mode label
is truncated and the transport remains vertically reachable.
 The pinned Compose
artifact exposes horizontal segmented rows but no vertical-row wrapper,
 so the large
state stacks real `SegmentedButton` elements in one outer selectable group and applies
the same baseline segmented colors,
 outline,
 selection fill,
 checkmark,
 and radio
semantics.
 It does not substitute another component or add horizontal scrolling.

### State cues and contrast

The user's 2026-09-04 correction forbids color-only state communication.
 The repaired
prototype uses these redundant cues:

- Current track:
   every active candidate removes the play icon and reserved leading
  column.
  Explicit label plus bold,
  accent plus bold,
  soft container plus bold,
  and outline plus bold each preserve full text width while combining visible cues and
  semantic current state.
- Selected playback mode:
   selected segmented fill plus checkmark at default and
  enlarged type.
- Selected letter:
   secondary-container color plus circular container shape.
- Selected folder:
   primary color plus medium weight plus a 2dp indicator spanning the
  bottom edge of the whole target.
   The label itself is never underlined.
- Slider value:
   active color plus handle position and track length.
- Q2b emphasis is not a state,
   but it still uses both foreground role and weight.

The folder treatment borrows MD1 tab state chrome without assigning tab semantics to
the wrapped folder targets.
 Google's archived MD1 tab specification defines a 48dp
height,
 12dp horizontal text padding,
 active accent-colored text,
 and a separate 2dp
accent indicator:
 <https://m1.material.io/components/tabs.html>.
 D31 retains 48dp
natural-width folder targets and uses the separate 2dp target-width indicator so the
label cannot be mistaken for a web link.

The captured AVD resolves the relevant dynamic light roles through Android resources.
WCAG calculations against those resolved values produce these limiting ratios:

- `onSurfaceVariant` on `surfaceDim`:
   4.532:1,
   the lowest text pair used.
- `primary` on `surfaceContainerLow`:
   5.794:1.
- `onSecondaryContainer` on `secondaryContainer`:
   6.124:1.
- `outline` on `surfaceContainerLow`:
   3.868:1,
   the lowest important non-text
  boundary pair used.
- `primary` slider track on `surfaceContainer`:
   5.500:1.

All rendered text pairs meet 4.5:1.
 Important non-text boundaries meet 3:1.
Decorative `outlineVariant` dividers do not communicate state or target boundaries.
The package validator recalculates every `onSurface` and `onSurfaceVariant` pairing
across all six surface roles plus the actual accent,
 container,
 outline,
 and slider
pairs.

### Edge-flush letter rail

The user requires the rail to match Nova Launcher's edge placement.
 The rail's 48dp
selectable bounds now begin at x=0.
 App-bar and source actions keep the measured start
inset.
 The current-screen refinement centers transport controls inside symmetric
horizontal system-gesture insets,
 correcting the prior 15dp fold-side displacement
without putting an interactive target into either edge region.
 Android's current
gesture-navigation guidance says an app
may selectively exclude an edge region only when an app gesture conflicts with Back:
<https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/touch-and-input/gestures/gesturenav>.
The Compose API can exclude a layout rectangle with `Modifier.systemGestureExclusion`:
<https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/systemGestureExclusion.modifier>.

No exclusion is applied here.
 An emulator swipe from x=20px,
 inside the reported 73px
back region,
 scrolled the rail from A-I to I-Q while the activity remained visible.
This proves the vertical rail gesture works without taking the whole rail away from
predictive Back.
 UI Automator reports each rail target at `[0,...][117,...]`,
 exactly
48dp wide and flush with the physical edge.

## Existing-screen refinement boundary

Every current refinement keeps the accepted screen's visible elements and structure.
The 24dp center spacer,
 16dp horizontal divider,
 surface roles,
 folder selection,
track rows,
 current-track cue,
 metadata,
 app bars,
 slider,
 transport actions,
 and mode
control remain present and in the same order.

The accepted transport used 30dp start gesture padding plus 16dp horizontal content
padding,
 but only 16dp at the fold side.
 Its mode-control axis was therefore 15dp away
from the 414dp pane axis.
 Every refinement uses symmetric horizontal system-gesture
padding and no additional horizontal padding.
 The measured mode outline runs from
x=73 through x=935 in the 2076px capture,
 centering it at x=504 within the x=0 through
x=1008 pane while retaining at least the native gesture-safe inset.

The visible `1:06` elapsed and `4:35` duration labels imply a 66/275,
 or 24%,
 seek
position.
 Every refinement uses that value instead of the prior unrelated 16% value.

Rows use 8dp,
 12dp,
 or 16dp spacing from Material's spacing system.
 Columns use only
baseline Material icon-button color styles for the existing skip actions:
 standard,
outlined,
 or tonal.
 The pause action stays filled and all icon-button targets remain
at least 48dp.
 The downloaded Material guidance ranks filled,
 tonal,
 outlined,
 and
standard from highest to lowest emphasis and recommends mixing styles to clarify a
primary action.
 Baseline Material exposes only the default small size,
 so the matrix
does not adopt Expressive size variants.

## Candidate boundary

Every repaired Q1 option must use valid Material surface roles:

- `1a`:
   tonal hierarchy with `surface`,
   `surfaceContainerLow`,
  `surfaceContainer`,
   and `surfaceContainerHigh`.
- `1b`:
   flat `surface` regions separated only by decorative
  `outlineVariant` dividers.
- `1c`:
   `surfaceDim` ground with `surfaceContainerLowest` content and
  `surfaceContainerLow` transport.
   D34 overrides the 24dp center spacer and 16dp
  picker/transport divider to white while retaining the dynamic `outlineVariant` rail
  line.
   White is an explicit product override rather than a `ColorScheme` role;
   both
  white regions are decorative layout separation,
   never state or interactive bounds.

Every repaired Q2 option keeps the same compliant list structure,
 selected-state role
pair,
 type roles,
 icons,
 and targets.
 Only the treatment of the true-peak supporting
value may differ.
 No option may remove required accessibility information or alter the
component structure.
 D35 settles the baseline on `3a`:
 one `onSurfaceVariant`
supporting line,
 leaving custom emphasis to planned display templating.

## Acceptance boundary

Before reopening the questionnaire:

- Build the debug prototype through its `mise` task.
- Record the emulator's wallpaper-derived theme settings before using Android dynamic
  color,
   so another capture can reproduce the resolved role palette.
- Install and capture all six candidates from the unfolded Pixel 9 Pro Fold emulator.
- Confirm native system bars,
   exact source dimensions,
   opacity,
   full-bleed pane
  backgrounds,
   a centered 24dp spacer,
   a 426dp physical right-half crop containing
  12dp of spacer and the 414dp detail pane,
   default-height app bars,
   Material icons,
   one-row
  segmented control,
   48dp targets,
   and valid selected-state role pairs.
- Inspect all captures at panel resolution and in the measured questionnaire frame.
- Rebuild the self-contained form and rerun package lint and unit contracts.
- Prove each new regression guard with a failing throwaway positive control.
- Exercise all previews,
   scaling controls,
   form paths,
   responsive scrollers,
   offline
  loading,
   forced-light presentation,
   and accessibility checks in Helium.
- Clear the form and reopen that exact corrected file in the user's normal Helium
  session.
