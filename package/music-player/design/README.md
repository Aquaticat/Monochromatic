# Music player design

Design source and decision record for the shared Android and desktop music player interface.
The work targets the Pixel 9 Pro Fold first while preserving one Material Design 3 identity across
Jetpack Compose and Slint.

This package contains exploratory Design Components,
rendered comparisons,
device metrics,
settled decisions,
and the active handover.
It does not describe shipped application behaviour unless a decision explicitly says it has been implemented.

## Start here

Read these files in order:

1. [`HANDOFF.md`](HANDOFF.md)
2. [`review-notes.md`](review-notes.md)
3. [`decisions.md`](decisions.md)
4. [`open-questions.md`](open-questions.md)
5. [`md3-tokens.md`](md3-tokens.md)
6. [`material-3-compliance.md`](material-3-compliance.md)
7. [`device-metrics.md`](device-metrics.md)
8. [`candidates.md`](candidates.md)

## Current questionnaire

The current grilling round is a self-contained HTML file under `questions/`.
Each round embeds its visual evidence,
option assessments,
recommendation,
and answer controls in one file.
The file is rendered and interaction-checked before it is opened in Helium.
For Android screen comparisons, the embedded rasters come from a non-functional
Jetpack Compose prototype installed on the target emulator, not from CSS redraws.
The active round's prototype is preserved on
`prototype/music-player-theme-compose`; its capture task waits for Compose content,
then records the unfolded panel at 2076 × 2152px with native system bars.

After each correction,
answer,
decision,
candidate,
or verification result,
update [`HANDOFF.md`](HANDOFF.md) immediately.
Do not defer the handover update until the end of a session.

## Historical source

The imported archive remains represented by the original root documents,
`candidates/`,
`screenshots/`,
`uploads/`,
and the bound Material Design 3 files under `_ds/`.
Historical candidates remain evidence for prior decisions,
including rejected directions.
