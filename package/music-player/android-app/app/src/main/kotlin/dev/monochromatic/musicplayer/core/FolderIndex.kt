// Folder index for the folder picker and the In order playback walk. It groups the library by its
// top-level folder (D3 and D17), then lays out each folder as one flat list (D5): the folder's own
// tracks first, then each subfolder as a header row followed by its tracks. Playback order follows the
// same list (D6).

// What:     `package dev.monochromatic.musicplayer.core` places this index beside the rail and path helpers.
// Why:      The index is pure logic over `Track` values, so it can be unit-tested on the JVM.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// // Module identity comes from the file path.
// ```
package dev.monochromatic.musicplayer.core

// What:     `import dev.monochromatic.musicplayer.Track` brings in the library track type.
// Why:      `Track` lives in the parent package, so the core package must import it by absolute name.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// import type { Track } from "dev.monochromatic.musicplayer/Track";
// ```
import dev.monochromatic.musicplayer.Track

// What:     `const val UNFILED_FOLDER_NAME: String = "Unfiled"` names the entry for tracks at the library root.
// Why:      Root-level tracks have no folder, so they need a visible name that sorts last in the picker.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// export const UNFILED_FOLDER_NAME = "Unfiled";
// ```
/** Folder name given to tracks that sit directly at the library root. */
const val UNFILED_FOLDER_NAME: String = "Unfiled"

// What:     `private const val PATH_SEPARATOR: String = "/"` is the separator between display path segments.
// Why:      Display paths use `/`, and the split must cut on the same character the path builders join with.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// const PATH_SEPARATOR = "/";
// ```
/** Separator between the segments of a relative display path. */
private const val PATH_SEPARATOR: String = "/"

// What:     `private const val CURRENT_DIRECTORY: String = "."` is the segment that names the current directory.
// Why:      Such segments are dropped so that `A/./x.flac` groups exactly like `A/x.flac`, as in RelPath.kt.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// const CURRENT_DIRECTORY = ".";
// ```
/** Path segment that refers to the directory itself and is ignored. */
private const val CURRENT_DIRECTORY: String = "."

// What:     `private const val PARENT_DIRECTORY: String = ".."` is the segment that names the parent directory.
// Why:      Such segments are dropped so that they cannot create a folder that the display path does not show.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// const PARENT_DIRECTORY = "..";
// ```
/** Path segment that refers to the parent directory and is ignored. */
private const val PARENT_DIRECTORY: String = ".."

// What:     `private const val MIN_FOLDERED_SEGMENTS: Int = 2` is the fewest segments a track path needs to sit
//           inside a folder: the folder name and the file name.
// Why:      A single-segment path names a file at the root, so it goes to the Unfiled entry.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// const MIN_FOLDERED_SEGMENTS = 2;
// ```

// What:     `data class FolderTrackRow(val track: Track, val indexInLibrary: Int)` pairs a track with its
//           position in the library list it came from.
// Why:      Playback and selection address tracks by library index, so the index must travel with the track.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// type FolderTrackRow = { track: Track; indexInLibrary: number };

// What:     `sealed interface FolderListItem` is one row of a folder's flat list. Its two variants are a
//           track row and a subfolder header row.
// Why:      A sealed type lets the picker render both row kinds exhaustively with no extra layer (D5).
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// type FolderListItem = { kind: "track"; row: FolderTrackRow } | { kind: "header"; name: string; trackCount: number };

    //           row for one subfolder.
    // Why:      The header names the subfolder and counts the tracks directly under it, and its tracks follow it.
    //

//           records where one track sits: its top-level folder (null at the root) and its subfolder path.
// Why:      Placement is computed once per track, so grouping and sorting work on plain values.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// type PlacedRow = { folder: string | null; subfolder: string; row: FolderTrackRow };
// ```
/** One track with its top-level folder and the subfolder path between that folder and the file. */

// Why:      `RelPath.kt` keeps its own splitter private, so folder grouping repeats the same rule here.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// const splitSegments = (p: string) => p.split("/").filter((s) => s !== "" && s !== "." && s !== "..");

//           the file name, joined through `joinDisplayPath` so the name is sanitized the same way.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):

// What:     `private fun folderNameOrder(): Comparator<String>` sorts names case-insensitively and

// Why:      The rail collator alone leaves names such as `Camellia` and `camellia` tied, and a tie-break keeps
//           the picker order stable across runs.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
