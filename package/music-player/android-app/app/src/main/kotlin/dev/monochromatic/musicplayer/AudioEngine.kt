// File summary (folded in from the interface's old KDoc):
//   This file defines the low-level audio "primitive" the app's engine implements: play one track at
//   a time, report the play/pause state and the natural end of a track, and expose the current
//   position and total duration so a seek bar can be drawn. Everything ABOVE this primitive, the play
//   queue, pagination, shuffle/scope selection, and transport orchestration (next/previous, gapless
//   handoff), lives in a separate class called PlayerController; this interface is ONLY the "play
//   this one file" seam. Keeping the surface this small lets PlayerController stay ignorant of native
//   handles, file descriptors, Rust modules, and other engine internals while still driving the single
//   production Rust engine and test fakes through one contract.
//
// What:     `package dev.monochromatic.musicplayer` declares which "package" (namespace, like a
//           folder-shaped grouping of related code) every declaration in this file belongs to. Other
//           Kotlin files that share this package can refer to these names without an import; files in
//           a different package must import them. Unlike Java, Kotlin does NOT force the on-disk
//           directory to match the package name, but this repo keeps them aligned anyway
//           (.../dev/monochromatic/musicplayer/AudioEngine.kt).
// Why:      We need this so the names defined here (the `AudioEngine` interface) live under a stable,
//           fully-qualified path `dev.monochromatic.musicplayer.AudioEngine`, and so siblings like
//           PlayerController can use `AudioEngine` directly without importing it.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// // No statement at all — in TS a file is implicitly its own module; the
// // directory path (e.g. src/dev/monochromatic/musicplayer/) is the namespace.
// ```
package dev.monochromatic.musicplayer

// What:     `interface AudioEngine { ... }` declares an "interface": a pure contract that lists method
//           signatures (names, parameters, return types) with NO bodies and NO stored fields. A class
//           that says `class RustEngine : AudioEngine` promises to provide a real implementation of
//           every method listed here. The `{ ... }` braces hold the member declarations.
//           Siblings the reader might have expected instead of `interface`:
//             - `abstract class` — could ALSO declare unimplemented methods, but a class can only
//               extend ONE class, whereas a type can implement MANY interfaces; an interface also
//               cannot hold constructor state.
//             - `class` / `data class` / `sealed interface` — those would carry implementation or a
//               closed set of subtypes; we want neither here, just the bare contract.
// Why:      We need this so the production Rust engine and the test fake conform to ONE shared shape.
//           PlayerController can then hold an `AudioEngine` reference and call `load`/`play`/`pause`
//           without knowing or caring whether it is driving native playback or a test double. This is
//           the "single seam" the file summary mentions.
// Gotcha:   This is a NOMINAL interface, not structural. A Kotlin class that happens to have all these
//           methods but does not write `: AudioEngine` is NOT an `AudioEngine`. TS would accept it on
//           shape alone; Kotlin will not.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// interface AudioEngine {
//   // ...method signatures go here, same as below...
// }
// ```
