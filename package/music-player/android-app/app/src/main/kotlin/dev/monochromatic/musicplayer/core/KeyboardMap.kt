// Keyboard shortcut classifier ported from the accepted keyboard-map prototype at
// package/music-player/design/questions/keyboard-map.prototype.html.
// The checks run in the prototype's order, so every request gets the action the prototype gives.
// The prototype's unknown-platform throw is replaced by the KeyboardPlatform enum, whose fromName
// parser rejects unknown platform names before a request can be built.

// What:     `package dev.monochromatic.musicplayer.core` places this file beside the other core
//           playback types.
// Why:      The classifier is plain Kotlin with no Android imports, so JVM unit tests can run it.

// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// // Module identity comes from the file path.
