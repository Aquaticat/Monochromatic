// ============================================================================
// File summary:
//
// This file holds the *concurrency skeleton* shared by both loudness sweeps: the
// foreground initial index (`PeakSweepService`, many parallel decoders) and the
// background upkeep (`PeakSweepWorker`, a single low-priority decoder). Both used
// to carry their own near-identical loop; this is the one extracted, tested copy.
//
// `sweepTracksInParallel` walks a list of work items across N coroutine workers
// pulling from one lock-free atomic cursor (so every item is claimed exactly
// once, no matter the worker count or interleaving), reports per-outcome tallies,
// flushes the caller's cache on a fixed cadence so an abrupt kill loses at most a
// batch, and honors cooperative cancellation (a stopped service/worker unwinds
// its decoders, and the tail still flushes once under `NonCancellable`).
//
// It is deliberately generic (`<T>`) and free of any Android type: the per-track
// op, the flush, and the progress callback are all injected. That is what lets it
// run as a fast, deterministic JVM unit test (`PeakSweepCoordinatorTest`) with
// fakes, instead of an on-device test that would see an already-warm cache and
// exercise no real parallel decode.
// ============================================================================

// What:     `package dev.monochromatic.musicplayer` puts these declarations in
//           the app's single namespace, the same one the service, the worker, and
//           `SweepOutcome` live in, so they refer to each other without imports.
// Why:      The service and worker call `sweepTracksInParallel`, and the
//           coordinator returns `SweepOutcome` values produced by `measureAndCache`.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// // No keyword; the directory + module system play this role.
// ```
package dev.monochromatic.musicplayer

// What:     `import kotlinx.coroutines.CoroutineDispatcher` names the type that
//           decides WHICH thread (pool) a coroutine runs on. The caller hands one
//           in: the foreground sweep passes its default-priority pool, the upkeep
//           worker passes its single low-priority thread.
// Why:      The coordinator must launch its workers onto the caller's chosen pool
//           rather than picking a thread policy itself.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// import type { CoroutineDispatcher } from "kotlinx/coroutines"; // ~ which worker pool
// ```
import kotlinx.coroutines.CoroutineDispatcher

// What:     `import kotlinx.coroutines.NonCancellable` names a special coroutine
//           context that makes the work inside it ignore cancellation.
// Why:      The final flush must complete even when the sweep is being cancelled,
//           or the last batch of measurements would be lost on a clean stop.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// import { NonCancellable } from "kotlinx/coroutines"; // run-even-if-aborted
// ```
import kotlinx.coroutines.NonCancellable

// What:     `import kotlinx.coroutines.coroutineScope` names the suspending
//           builder that runs a block and does not return until every child
//           coroutine launched inside it has finished (a structured-concurrency
//           barrier).
// Why:      We launch N workers and must wait for all of them to drain the cursor
//           before reporting the tally; `coroutineScope` is that join.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// import { coroutineScope } from "kotlinx/coroutines"; // ~ await Promise.all of children
// ```
import kotlinx.coroutines.coroutineScope

// What:     `import kotlinx.coroutines.isActive` names the coroutine-scope flag
//           that flips to false the moment the coroutine is cancelled.
// Why:      Each worker loops `while (isActive)` so a cancelled sweep stops
//           claiming new items promptly instead of running to the end.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// import { isActive } from "kotlinx/coroutines"; // ~ !signal.aborted
// ```
import kotlinx.coroutines.isActive

// What:     `import kotlinx.coroutines.launch` names the builder that starts a new
//           child coroutine that runs concurrently with its siblings.
// Why:      We start one `launch` per worker; together they consume the cursor.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// import { launch } from "kotlinx/coroutines"; // ~ spawn a concurrent task
// ```
import kotlinx.coroutines.launch

// What:     `import kotlinx.coroutines.withContext` switches the coroutine context
//           for the duration of a block (here, into `NonCancellable`).
// Why:      The final flush is wrapped in `withContext(NonCancellable) { ... }` so
//           it survives cancellation.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// import { withContext } from "kotlinx/coroutines";
// ```
import kotlinx.coroutines.withContext

// What:     `import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger` names a thread-safe
//           integer whose updates (`getAndIncrement`, `incrementAndGet`) are
//           atomic: concurrent callers never tear or lose an update.
// Why:      The cursor and every tally counter are shared across workers, so they
//           must be atomic, not plain `Int`s.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// import { AtomicInteger } from "java/util/concurrent/atomic"; // JS has no real one (single-threaded)
// ```
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger

// What:     `suspend fun <T> sweepTracksInParallel(...)` declares the coordinator.
//           - `suspend` because it awaits the workers and the injected suspend ops.
//           - `<T>` is a type parameter: the item type is the caller's (a `Track`
//             in production, an `Int` in the test); the coordinator never inspects
//             it, only passes it to `process`.
//           - the trailing lambda params (`process`, `onFlush`, `onProgress`) are
//             the seams the test replaces with fakes.
// Why:      One tested loop both sweeps share, instead of two hand-written copies.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// async function sweepTracksInParallel<T>(opts: {...}): Promise<SweepTally> { ... }
// ```
/**
 * Runs [process] over the first [maxTracks] of [items] across [workers] coroutines on [dispatcher],
 * a lock-free [AtomicInteger] cursor handing each index to whichever worker is free so every visited
 * item is claimed exactly once. Calls [onFlush] after every [flushBatch] [SweepOutcome.MEASURED]
 * results and once more at the end (even under cancellation, via [NonCancellable]), so an abrupt stop
 * loses at most one batch. Fires [onProgress] every [notifyEvery] visited items when [notifyEvery] is
 * positive. Cooperative cancellation of the calling scope stops the workers promptly. Pass
 * [workers] of 1 for a serial sweep. Returns the [SweepTally].
