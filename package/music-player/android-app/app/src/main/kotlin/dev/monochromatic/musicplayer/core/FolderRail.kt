// Rail model for the folder picker. It ports the JavaScript rail in design/candidates/buckets.js and its
// helper scriptOf in design/candidates/artists.js. Only writing systems present in the library get a
// section (D28). Every cell is keyed by the first character of a folder name, with no sub-letter
// segmentation (D3 and D17).

// What:     `package dev.monochromatic.musicplayer.core` places this model beside the other pure logic.
// Why:      The rail needs no Android types, so it can be unit-tested on the JVM.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// // Module identity comes from the file path.
// ```
package dev.monochromatic.musicplayer.core

// What:     `import java.text.Collator` and `import java.util.Locale` bring in the locale-aware comparator.
// Why:      `Collator` exists on both the JVM and Android, so the sort matches the JS localeCompare.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// // Intl.Collator is the closest TS equivalent.
// ```

// What:     `enum class RailScript(val id: String, val label: String)` lists the six writing systems
//           that can own a section, in the order the rail shows them.
// Why:      The declaration order is the section order, and each `id` prefixes that script's cell keys.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// type RailScript = "latin" | "jpn" | "cyrl" | "grek" | "hang" | "other";
// ```

    LATIN("latin", "A"),

    // What:     `JAPANESE("jpn", "あ")` is the Japanese section, labelled with a kana.

    //
    // In TS you'd write (pseudocode):

    // What:     `CYRILLIC("cyrl", "А")` is the Cyrillic section, labelled with the Cyrillic capital A.
    // Why:      The label uses U+0410 so the rail shows the script's own letter.

    // In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
    // ```ts
    // const CYRILLIC = { id: "cyrl", label: "А" };

    CYRILLIC("cyrl", "А"),

    // What:     `GREEK("grek", "Α")` is the Greek section, labelled with the Greek capital alpha.
    // Why:      The label uses U+0391 so the rail shows the script's own letter.
    //
    // In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
    // ```ts
    // const GREEK = { id: "grek", label: "Α" };

    GREEK("grek", "Α"),

    // What:     `HANGUL("hang", "가")` is the Hangul section, labelled with the syllable ga.
    // Why:      The label uses U+AC00 so the rail shows a Hangul syllable.
    //
    // In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
    // ```ts
    // const HANGUL = { id: "hang", label: "가" };
    // ```
    /** Hangul syllables, with one cell per first syllable. */
    HANGUL("hang", "가"),

    // What:     `OTHER("other", "#")` is the catch-all section for digits, symbols, and unsupported scripts.
    // Why:      Every name lands in some section, so no folder is hidden from the rail.
    //
    // In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
