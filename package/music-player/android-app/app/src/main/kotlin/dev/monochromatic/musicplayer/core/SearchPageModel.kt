// Pure decisions for the Search page: status copy, TalkBack labels, emphasis ranges, and the query rules
// for entering and returning to Search. Nothing here touches Compose, so every rule is unit-tested on the JVM.

// What:     `package dev.monochromatic.musicplayer.core` places the page model beside the search results.
// Why:      The status and label rules read `SearchState` and `SearchResult` directly, so they share the package.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// // Module identity comes from the file path.
// ```
package dev.monochromatic.musicplayer.core

// What:     `const val SEARCH_PROMPT_TITLE: String` is the headline shown before any query is typed.
// Why:      An empty query is an invitation, not a failed lookup, so it gets its own copy (D70).
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// export const SEARCH_PROMPT_TITLE = "Search your music";
// ```
/** Headline of the unqueried prompt (D70). */
const val SEARCH_PROMPT_TITLE: String = "Search your music"

// What:     `const val SEARCH_PROMPT_DETAIL: String` explains what the prompt searches.
// Why:      The review text pairs the prompt with this line so the user knows Search covers the library.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// export const SEARCH_PROMPT_DETAIL = "Type a name to explore your library.";
// ```
/** Supporting line under the unqueried prompt (D70). */
const val SEARCH_PROMPT_DETAIL: String = "Type a name to explore your library."

// What:     `const val SEARCH_NO_MATCH_PREFIX: String` begins the completed no-match headline.
// Why:      The headline names the entered query after this prefix, and the prefix is the only fixed text in it.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// export const SEARCH_NO_MATCH_PREFIX = "No results for “";
// ```
/** Opening text of the completed no-match headline, before the entered query. */
const val SEARCH_NO_MATCH_PREFIX: String = "No results for “"

// What:     `const val SEARCH_NO_MATCH_SUFFIX: String` closes the no-match headline after the query.
// Why:      Curly quotes match the review text, and the query stays visibly delimited.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// export const SEARCH_NO_MATCH_SUFFIX = "”";
// ```
/** Closing text of the completed no-match headline, after the entered query. */
const val SEARCH_NO_MATCH_SUFFIX: String = "”"

// What:     `const val SEARCH_NO_MATCH_DETAIL: String` is the support line under a completed no-match.
// Why:      D70 keeps this support line with the query named in the headline.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// export const SEARCH_NO_MATCH_DETAIL = "Try another name.";
// ```
/** Supporting line under a completed no-match headline (D70). */
const val SEARCH_NO_MATCH_DETAIL: String = "Try another name."

// What:     `const val SEARCH_UNAVAILABLE_TITLE: String` headlines a known inability to search the source.
// Why:      D71 rejects the debug fixture's "Library unavailable" because no owner can promise a recovery.
//           This wording names only the known state, so it makes no recovery promise and names no cause.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// export const SEARCH_UNAVAILABLE_TITLE = "Search is unavailable";
// ```
/** Headline for a known source failure, with no cause and no recovery promise (D71). */
const val SEARCH_UNAVAILABLE_TITLE: String = "Search is unavailable"

// What:     `const val SEARCH_UNAVAILABLE_DETAIL: String` is the support line under the unavailable headline.
// Why:      It states only what is known, so the still-visible browser and deck are not described as broken.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// export const SEARCH_UNAVAILABLE_DETAIL = "The current library can't be searched right now.";
// ```
/** Supporting line under the unavailable headline, stating only the known fact (D71). */
const val SEARCH_UNAVAILABLE_DETAIL: String = "The current library can't be searched right now."

// What:     `const val SEARCH_EMPTY_INVENTORY_TITLE: String` headlines a usable source that holds no tracks.
// Why:      A confirmed empty inventory is distinct from a finished no-match (D69), so it is not worded as one.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// export const SEARCH_EMPTY_INVENTORY_TITLE = "No music found in your audio library.";
// ```
/** Headline for a confirmed empty searchable inventory (D69). */
const val SEARCH_EMPTY_INVENTORY_TITLE: String = "No music found in your audio library."

// What:     `const val SEARCH_FIELD_LABEL: String` names the query field for assistive technology.
// Why:      The field's accessible name stays "Search music" while the typed query is its separate value (D75).
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// export const SEARCH_FIELD_LABEL = "Search music";
// ```
/** Accessible name of the query field, separate from its current value (D75). */
const val SEARCH_FIELD_LABEL: String = "Search music"

// What:     `const val SEARCH_BACK_LABEL: String` names the visible Back control.
// Why:      Back returns to the player (D64), and the spoken name must say so.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// export const SEARCH_BACK_LABEL = "Back to player";
// ```
/** Accessible name of the visible Back control, which returns to the player (D64). */
const val SEARCH_BACK_LABEL: String = "Back to player"

// What:     `const val SEARCH_CLEAR_LABEL: String` names the Clear control.
// Why:      Clear erases the query only, so its spoken name says it clears the search (D65).
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// export const SEARCH_CLEAR_LABEL = "Clear search";
// ```
/** Accessible name of the Clear control (D65). */
const val SEARCH_CLEAR_LABEL: String = "Clear search"

// What:     `const val SEARCH_FOLDER_ACTION: String` is the spoken action for a folder result.
// Why:      A folder result opens its folder without autoplay (D72), and the action label must say that.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// export const SEARCH_FOLDER_ACTION = "Open folder without autoplay";
// ```
/** Spoken action of a folder result, which opens the folder without starting playback (D72). */
const val SEARCH_FOLDER_ACTION: String = "Open folder without autoplay"

// What:     `const val SEARCH_TRACK_PLAY_ACTION: String` is the spoken action for a track that is not current.
// Why:      A different track starts playing (D73), so the action label is Play track (D77).
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// export const SEARCH_TRACK_PLAY_ACTION = "Play track";
// ```
/** Spoken action of a track result that is not the current track (D73, D77). */
const val SEARCH_TRACK_PLAY_ACTION: String = "Play track"

// What:     `const val SEARCH_TRACK_PAUSE_ACTION: String` is the spoken action for the playing current track.
// Why:      The current track toggles playback, and while it plays the toggle pauses it (D73, D77).
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// export const SEARCH_TRACK_PAUSE_ACTION = "Pause track";
// ```
/** Spoken action of the current track while it plays (D73, D77). */
const val SEARCH_TRACK_PAUSE_ACTION: String = "Pause track"

// What:     `const val SEARCH_TRACK_TOGGLE_ACTION: String` is the action when the playing state is unknown.
// Why:      Claiming Play or Pause without knowing the state would be false, so the label names the toggle only.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// export const SEARCH_TRACK_TOGGLE_ACTION = "Play or pause track";
// ```
/** Spoken action of the current track when its playing state is not known to the page. */
const val SEARCH_TRACK_TOGGLE_ACTION: String = "Play or pause track"

// What:     `const val SEARCH_FOLDER_KIND: String` is the spoken kind word of a folder result.
// Why:      The kind must be spoken once, because the decorative icon alone is not an accessible cue (D77).
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// export const SEARCH_FOLDER_KIND = "Folder";
// ```
/** Spoken kind word of a folder result (D77). */
const val SEARCH_FOLDER_KIND: String = "Folder"

// What:     `const val SEARCH_TRACK_KIND: String` is the spoken kind word of a track result.
// Why:      Like the folder kind, it is spoken once so the icon is not an extra accessibility stop (D77).
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// export const SEARCH_TRACK_KIND = "Track";
// ```
/** Spoken kind word of a track result (D77). */
const val SEARCH_TRACK_KIND: String = "Track"

// What:     `data class SearchStatusLine(...)` is one headline with an optional support line.
// Why:      The page draws the same two-line status anatomy for every non-result state.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// type SearchStatusLine = { title: string; detail: string | null };
// ```

// Why:      The page merges the row into one stop, so kind, state, and action are kept as separate fields.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// type SearchRowSemantics = { kindLabel: string; actionLabel: string; stateLabel: string | null };

//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
