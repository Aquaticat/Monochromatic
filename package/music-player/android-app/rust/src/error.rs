//! One error type for the whole native engine. Five failure cases (I/O,
//! symphonia decode, opus decode, unsupported file/codec, and AAudio output)
//! all funnel into `PlayerError` so any function can use the `?` operator
//! freely: a sub-error gets converted into a `PlayerError` and propagated up
//! with no bespoke conversion at the call site. The `Audio` variant carries
//! AAudio (Android's native low-latency audio output) failures, formatted to
//! text in `engine_worker.rs`. (Think of this `//!` block as the file-level
//! docstring that would sit at the very top of a TS module.)

/// What:     `use std::fmt;` pulls in the standard-library formatting module. It
///           is the module that defines `Display` (the "pretty, user-facing
///           string" trait), `Formatter` (the buffer we write that string into),
///           and the `write!` macro that targets a `Formatter`.
/// Why:      We need it so the `impl fmt::Display` block below, and every
///           `fmt::Formatter` / `fmt::Result` name in this file, is in scope.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// // no import: toString() is built in

/// message for unsupported files/codecs.
// What:     `#[derive(Debug)]` is an attribute that auto-generates code: it asks
//           the compiler to write a `Debug` implementation for the enum on the
//           next line. `Debug` is the trait behind the `{:?}` format specifier,
//           i.e. the developer-facing dump of a value (as opposed to `Display`,
//           the user-facing one we hand-write below).
// Why:      Errors must be `Debug` so they can flow through `?`/`Result`, be
//           unwrapped, and be logged; the `std::error::Error` bound below also
//           requires it. Deriving saves us writing that boilerplate by hand.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// // no annotation: every JS value already has a default string form
// ```
#[derive(Debug)]
// What:     `pub enum PlayerError { ... }` declares a public SUM TYPE: a value of
//           this type is exactly ONE of the listed variants at a time, never
//           several. Several variants are tuple-style (`Name(InnerType)`), which
//           means the variant WRAPS one inner value. `pub` makes the type
//           visible to other modules in this crate and to crates that depend on
//           it.
// Why:      One unified error type means the `?` operator can convert any
//           sub-error (io, symphonia, opus) into this single type and propagate
//           it up, with no per-call-site conversion code.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// type PlayerError =
//   | { kind: "io"; cause: Error }
//   | { kind: "decode"; cause: Error }
//   | { kind: "opus"; cause: Error }
//   | { kind: "unsupported"; message: string }
