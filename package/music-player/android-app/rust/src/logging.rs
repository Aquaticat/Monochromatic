//! The Android tracing subscriber: a logcat sink installed once per process.
//!
//! Android's stderr never reaches logcat, so every `tracing` event from this crate and the
//! shared `truepeak-core` is routed to logcat through `paranoid-android`'s subscriber layer.
//! The JNI create entries call `init()` at startup; a `OnceLock` makes repeated calls (each
//! JNI entry, each process re-attach) idempotent. The level is read from `RUST_LOG`
//! (default `info`).

/// What:     `use std::sync::OnceLock;`. A write-once cell (sibling `Once`) guarding the
///           one-time global-subscriber install across concurrent JNI calls.
/// Why:      Installing the global default twice would error; the cell runs the closure once.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// let installed = false; // set once, then skip
/// ```
use std::sync::OnceLock;

/// What:     `use tracing_subscriber::EnvFilter;`. The `RUST_LOG`-driven level filter.
/// Why:      Lets a developer raise the level with `adb shell setprop`/env without a rebuild.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// import { EnvFilter } from "tracing-subscriber";
/// ```
use tracing_subscriber::EnvFilter;

/// What:     `use tracing_subscriber::prelude::*;`. Brings the registry `.with(...)` combinator
///           and `.try_init()` into scope.
/// Why:      The layered subscriber is composed with these extension traits.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// import "tracing-subscriber/prelude";
/// ```
use tracing_subscriber::prelude::*;

/// What:     `static LOGGING: OnceLock<()> = OnceLock::new();`. The one-time install guard.
/// Why:      Every JNI create entry may call `init()`; only the first does the work.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// const LOGGING = new Once();
/// ```
static LOGGING: OnceLock<()> = OnceLock::new();

/// What:     `pub fn init()`. Install the logcat tracing subscriber once, idempotently.
/// Why:      Android stderr never reaches logcat, so without this a device build is silent;
///           `try_init` (not `init`) tolerates a subscriber another component already set.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// logging.init(); // first JNI entry installs the logcat sink
/// ```
