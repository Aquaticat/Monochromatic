//! Android true-peak resolution: a thin adapter that drives the shared policy resolver.
//!
//! "True peak" (a.k.a. inter-sample peak) is the highest level the analog waveform reaches
//! AFTER a DAC reconstructs it between the stored samples; it can sit above the largest
//! stored sample. The measurement policy (full-scan short tracks, probe long ones), the
//! Catmull-Rom meter, the attenuate-only gain, the window placement, and the decision cache
//! now all live once in the shared `truepeak-core` crate. Android's old windowed policy (a
//! `1.26` safety factor over four fixed windows) is GONE, replaced by the shared proportional
//! probe. This module keeps only the Android glue: a [`TruePeakSource`] adapter over the
//! Android `decode::Source`, and two resolvers that drive an already-opened source (the JNI
//! opens it from a `content://` fd). The native service handle (`src/service.rs`) calls these
//! and caches the resulting decisions. See
//! ../../../doc/handover/music-player-truepeak-core-integration.md.

/// What:     `use crate::decode::Source;`. The decoder trait, named by the adapter's `inner`
///           field and driven through its `spec`/`next_chunk`/`seek` methods.
/// Why:      The adapter wraps a `Box<dyn Source>` and forwards to it.

///           and the two resolvers.
