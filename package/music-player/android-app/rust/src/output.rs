//! AAudio output backend (raw `ndk::audio`): the latency-probe stage of the
//! Android audio path. It opens a single SILENT, low-latency output stream,
//! lets it run for a fraction of a second, reads the stream's presentation
//! timestamp, and reports how many milliseconds of audio sit buffered ahead of
//! the speaker. The point is to PROVE the pure-Rust AAudio path can open and
//! run a stream on a real device before the engine starts pushing real audio
//! through it; the number it returns is a diagnostic, not something the player
//! consumes.
//!
//! Mental model for a TypeScript reader: AAudio is Android's low-level C audio
//! API. `ndk::audio` is a thin Rust wrapper over that C API, so almost every
//! type here is an `i32` (because the underlying C functions take and return
//! C `int32_t`), and the data callback hands us a RAW MEMORY ADDRESS (`*mut
//! c_void`) instead of a typed array, exactly like a C function would. There is
//! no persistent state, no struct, no threads we spawn, no shared flags: this
//! is one fire-and-forget measurement function plus two small helpers it calls.
//!
//! Unlike the desktop `output_cpal.rs` / `output_pipewire.rs` backends, NOTHING
//! here owns a ring buffer, an `Arc`, or an `AtomicBool`. Do not carry mental
//! models over from those files; this is a standalone probe, and the only thing
//! it shares with them is the idea of an OS audio "stream" with a realtime fill
//! callback.

/// What:     `use std::os::raw::c_void;`. `c_void` is Rust's stand-in for C's
///           `void` type. It exists only to be pointed AT: a `*mut c_void` is "a
///           raw address to some bytes whose type Rust does not know". Siblings
///           you might expect: `u8` (a byte) or `()` (Rust's own empty/unit
///           type); `c_void` is specifically the one that lines up with the C
///           ABI, which is what AAudio speaks.
/// Why:      The AAudio data callback (below) receives the output buffer as a
///           `*mut c_void`, mirroring the C signature, so we must name this type
///           to write that signature.

/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):

///           with: `Instant`, which is a TIMESTAMP (a moment on the clock);
///           `Duration` is a LENGTH.
/// Why:      We sleep for a fixed `Duration` after starting the stream so audio

///           - `AudioDirection`: enum picking input vs output (`Output` here).
///           - `AudioFormat`: enum naming the sample format (`PCM_Float` here).
///           - `AudioPerformanceMode`: enum picking the latency/power tradeoff
///             (`LowLatency` here).
///           - `AudioStream`: the opened stream handle type (a parameter type of
///             the callback).
///           - `AudioStreamBuilder`: the builder we configure step by step and
///             then `.open_stream()` on.
///           - `Clockid`: enum naming which OS clock the presentation timestamp
///             is measured against (`Monotonic` here).
/// Why:      Every one of these names is used below to build, open, run, and
///           query the stream; importing them brings them into scope so we can
///           write them unqualified.

/// What:     `const SAMPLE_RATE: i32 = 48_000;`. A compile-time constant naming
///           the requested sample rate (48 kHz, a standard rate). `i32` is a
///           signed 32-bit integer. Siblings the reader might expect: `u32`
///           (unsigned 32-bit), `usize` (pointer-wide unsigned), `i64`
///           (signed 64-bit). The `_` in `48_000` is just a digit separator for

/// Why:      We ask AAudio to open the stream at this rate; the device may give
///           us a different actual rate, which is why we re-read it later.
/// Why i32:  `ndk::audio`'s `.sample_rate(...)` setter takes an `i32` because the

///           `i64` are the siblings).
/// Why:      We request a 2-channel stream and, separately, use the count to
///           compute how many `f32` samples a frame's worth of audio is.
/// Why i32:  `.channel_count(...)` on the builder takes an `i32` (the AAudio C
///           API uses `int32_t`), so storing the constant as `i32` matches that
///           setter with no cast; we only convert to `usize` where we index.

const CHANNELS: i32 = 2;

/// What:     `const SETTLE: Duration = Duration::from_millis(300);`. A constant
///           `Duration` of 300 milliseconds. `Duration::from_millis(300)` is a
///           CONSTRUCTOR call: it builds a `Duration` value from a millisecond
///           count (the `::` is the path to an associated function on the
///           `Duration` type, like a static method).
/// Why:      After starting the stream we wait this long so frames are actually

/// Why f64:  We use `f64` (not `f32`) because the helper returns `f64` and

pub fn measure_output_latency_ms() -> Option<f64> {
    // What:     `let stream = AudioStreamBuilder::new().ok()? . ... .open_stream().ok()?;`.
    //           This single `let` statement spans many lines: it builds and
    //           opens the stream in one chained expression. Reading top to bottom:
    //           - `AudioStreamBuilder::new()` calls the builder's constructor
    //             (the `::` reaches an associated function). It returns a
    //             `Result<AudioStreamBuilder, _>` (success-or-failure).
    //           - `.ok()` turns that `Result` into an `Option` by DROPPING the
    //             error (keeping `Some(builder)` on success, `None` on failure).
    //           - `?` on the `Option` unwraps `Some` to the inner builder, OR
    //             returns `None` from `measure_output_latency_ms` immediately if
    //             it was `None`. (Early-exit-on-nothing operator.)
    //           - `.direction(AudioDirection::Output)` sets the stream to be an
    //             OUTPUT (playback) stream; `AudioDirection::Output` names one
    //             variant of that enum.
    //           - `.format(AudioFormat::PCM_Float)` asks for 32-bit float
    //             samples (`PCM_Float` variant); this is why the callback writes
    //             `f32`s.
    //           - `.sample_rate(SAMPLE_RATE)` and `.channel_count(CHANNELS)`
    //             pass our `i32` constants straight through (no cast needed,
    //             they match the setters' `i32` parameters).
    //           - `.performance_mode(AudioPerformanceMode::LowLatency)` picks
    //             the lowest-latency mode (the variant we want for an honest
    //             latency reading).
    //           - `.data_callback(Box::new(silent_callback))` registers our fill
    //             function. `Box::new(...)` heap-allocates the callback behind an
    //             owning pointer (`Box<T>` is "an owned value on the heap";
    //             siblings `Rc<T>`/`Arc<T>` are the shared, reference-counted
    //             versions). AAudio needs to store the callback, so it must be
    //             boxed.
    //           - `.open_stream()` actually opens the OS stream, returning a
    //             `Result<AudioStream, _>`; `.ok()?` again drops the error and
    //             early-returns `None` on failure, leaving `stream` bound to the
    //             opened `AudioStream` on success.
    // Why:      One configured, opened, ready-to-start output stream. If ANY
    //           step fails we bail out of the whole probe with `None` (the
    //           function's contract is "a number, or nothing").
    // Gotcha:   each `.ok()?` SILENTLY discards the underlying error and converts
    //           failure into a plain `None`; we lose any detail about WHY a step
    //           failed. That is intentional for a best-effort probe, but it
    //           means a `None` return tells you "something failed", not what.

    //             `f32` made of all-zero bytes IS `0.0`, so this is silence.
    // Why:      The buffer must be filled every callback or the speaker would get
    //           uninitialized garbage; silence (`0.0`) keeps the probe inaudible
    //           while the stream keeps running.
    // Gotcha:   `unsafe` does NOT mean "dangerous magic"; it means "the compiler

///           - `rate: i32`. The stream's actual sample rate, passed by copy.
///           Returns `Option<f64>`: the latency in ms (`Some(x)`) or `None` when
///           the numbers do not make sense (bad rate, or a negative buffer).

    //           divide-by-zero), so we bail. `return None;` is an EARLY return of
    //           the "nothing" case of `Option`.

    //             measured against the monotonic clock (`Clockid::Monotonic` is
    //             one variant of the `Clockid` enum: a clock that only ever moves
    //             forward, never jumping like wall-clock time can). It returns a
    //             `Result<Timestamp, _>`.
    //           - `.ok()` converts that `Result` to an `Option`, dropping any

    // Why:      The timestamp tells us which frame the HARDWARE has actually
    //           presented, which we need to compute how far ahead we are buffered.

    //           Compute how many frames are buffered ahead of the speaker.
    //           - `stream.frames_written()` is how many frames the APP has pushed
    //             into the stream so far.
    //           - `timestamp.frame_position` is which frame the HARDWARE has
    //             already presented (played).
    //           - Their difference is the backlog: frames written but not yet
    //             heard. The type is inferred (no annotation); it is a signed
    //             integer frame delta, so it CAN be negative if the numbers race.
    // Why:      That backlog, divided by the sample rate, IS the output latency
    //           (how long until a just-written sample reaches the DAC).

    //           race) and the number is not trustworthy, so bail with `None`.
    // Why:      Better to report "no measurement" than a nonsensical negative
    //           latency.

    //           TAIL expression (no trailing `;`), so it is the return value.
    //           - `buffered as f64` casts the integer frame backlog to a 64-bit
    //             float.
    //           - `rate as f64` casts the `i32` sample rate to a 64-bit float so
    //             the division is float division (integer division would
    //             truncate).
    //           - `(buffered / rate)` is the latency in SECONDS; multiplying by
    //             `MILLIS_PER_SEC` (1000.0) converts to milliseconds.
    //           - `Some(...)` wraps the resulting `f64` in the "has a value" case
    //             of `Option`, because the signature promises `Option<f64>`.
