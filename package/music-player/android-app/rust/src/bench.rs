///           crosses the JVM ABI boundary".

    //           `Result<(), PlayerError>` (success carrying the empty tuple `()` =

    //           expression but explicitly throw the result away, which also silences
    //           the "unused must-use Result" warning.
    // Why:      Run the seek path once so it is exercised on-device, but we do not care
    //           whether it succeeded here (the real engine handles seek for keeps).
    // Gotcha:   `let _ =` is NOT a real variable; it binds to nothing and immediately

    //           ordinary equality. On a true condition, `return -4.0` exits the whole
    //           function with the "-4 zero samples" sentinel.
    // Why:      Avoid dividing by zero below, and report the empty-decode case.
    //
    // In TS you'd write (pseudocode):

    //           function's tail expression (no `;`), so it is the return value.
    //           `elapsed.as_nanos()` converts the `Duration` to an integer count of
    //           nanoseconds (`u128`); `as f64` casts that to a 64-bit float; `/ 1000.0`
    //           turns nanoseconds into microseconds; `total_samples as f64` casts the
    //           `u64` counter to a float so the final division yields microseconds per
    //           sample. Every `as` is an explicit numeric cast (Rust never converts
    //           number types implicitly).
    // Why:      Produce the single comparable figure: microseconds of decode time per
    //           interleaved sample.

    //           a fractional microseconds-per-sample result.
