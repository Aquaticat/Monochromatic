//! The native true-peak service handle and its JNI entry points.
//!
//! Kotlin holds one opaque `jlong` handle to a `TruePeakService`. The service owns a dedicated
//! thread running a current-thread Tokio runtime and the shared `truepeak_core::DecisionCache`
//! (a Turso-backed `decisions.db` in the app-private dir). Because a Turso connection cannot be
//! assumed `Send`, the connection never leaves that thread: the handle is only two channel
//! senders (both `Send + Sync`), so a `&TruePeakService` shared across the foreground and
//! warming JNI threads is sound. Cache reads and writes cross the channels; the BLOCKING decode
//! and shared-resolver call happen on the JNI calling thread (never the cache thread), so a
//! slow full scan never stalls a cache lookup. This module also holds the JNI functions Kotlin
//! calls: create, release, resolve (foreground), and warm (background upgrade).

/// What:     `use std::os::fd::RawFd;`. The Unix raw-file-descriptor alias (an `i32`).
/// Why:      The resolve/warm JNI entries hand a `content://` fd to the decoder.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// type RawFd = number;
/// ```

/// What:     `use std::thread;`. OS-thread spawning.

/// // std::thread ~ a dedicated Worker

/// What:     `use jni::objects::{JClass, JString};`. The calling class handle and a borrowed

/// Why:      Handles and fingerprints are `jlong`, the fd is `jint`, and gains are `jfloat`.
