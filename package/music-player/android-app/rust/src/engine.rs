//! Native playback engine: the per-track primitive behind Kotlin's `AudioEngine`.
//! A single worker thread owns the decode `Source`, the SPSC ring producer, and
//! the AAudio output stream, and processes `Command`s; the realtime AAudio callback
//! only pops samples, gates on the play flag, applies volume, and advances the
//! played-frame counter. Kotlin drives it over JNI and POLLS state from `Control`'s
//! atomics (no native-to-JVM callbacks). Ports the desktop engine's ringbuf + worker
//! model to AAudio; the queue/advance/shuffle stay in Kotlin's PlayerController.
//!
//! Threads, for a TypeScript reader: `Engine::new` starts a background worker
//! (`std::thread`). Kotlin (running on the JVM, calling in over JNI) talks to it two
//! ways. Slow, owned-state commands (load a file, seek, quit) go down a one-way queue
//! (an `mpsc` channel: many senders, one receiver). Fast, per-sample knobs (play,
//! pause, volume, normalization gain) skip the queue and write shared ATOMIC fields
//! in `Control` directly, so the next audio callback observes them with no round trip.
//! Unlike the desktop engine, there is NO callback into the caller: Kotlin polls the
//! same `Control` atomics for position/duration/ended. The atomics are the entire
//! shared surface; picture them as a small struct of values updated and read by three
//! threads at once (JNI/main, the decode worker, the realtime AAudio callback) without
//! a lock.

/// What:     `use std::os::fd::{BorrowedFd, RawFd};`. Two file-descriptor types from
///           the standard library's Unix fd module. A "file descriptor" is the small
///           integer the OS hands you to refer to an open file/socket/pipe. `RawFd` is
///           literally that integer (a bare `i32`) with NO ownership meaning: holding
///           one does not keep the file open and dropping one does not close it.
///           `BorrowedFd<'fd>` is a typed, lifetime-tagged BORROW of an fd you do not
///           own (you may use it but must not close it). Sibling you might expect:
///           `OwnedFd`, which DOES own the fd and closes it on drop; we never construct
///           one of those directly here, we go through `std::fs::File` instead.
/// Why:      Kotlin passes the audio file's fd in as a plain integer over JNI; we need
///           `RawFd` to receive it and `BorrowedFd` to wrap it safely before duplicating.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):

/// What:     `use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, AtomicU32, AtomicU64, Ordering};`.

///           `AtomicU32` / `AtomicU64` is a `bool` / 32-bit / 64-bit unsigned integer
///           that MULTIPLE THREADS may read and write at the same time without a lock
///           or a data race; reads and writes go through `.load()` / `.store()` methods,

///           `Drop` is Rust's DESTRUCTOR trait: its `drop` method runs automatically the
///           moment an `Engine` goes out of scope (when Kotlin's JNI glue frees the handle).
/// Why:      Tell the worker to quit and wait for it, so the AAudio stream the worker owns
///           is closed cleanly before the process moves on.

/// ```ts
/// class Engine { [Symbol.dispose]() { /* send quit, then await worker */ } }

    ///           engine down mutates it (it `.take()`s the worker handle out). The runtime,
    ///           not your code, calls this; you never call `drop` by name.
    /// Why:      Run graceful shutdown at end of the engine's life.

        //           WRAPPER CONSTRUCTOR for the `Quit` variant. `self.tx.send(...)` returns
        //           a `Result`; `let _ =` DISCARDS it (the worker may already be gone).

        //           `self.worker.take()` MOVES the `JoinHandle` out of the `Option`, leaving
        //           `None` behind and returning the old value (`Some(handle)` or `None`).
        //           `if let Some(worker) = ...` is a one-arm PATTERN MATCH that runs the body
        //           ONLY when the `Option` was `Some`, binding the inner handle to `worker`.
        //           Inside, `worker.join()` BLOCKS until the worker thread finishes and
        //           returns a `Result` (errs if the worker panicked); `let _ =` discards it.
        // Why:      Join exactly once (the `.take()` guarantees it) and wait for the worker
        //           so its AAudio stream is fully closed before we return; a worker panic is
        //           not worth acting on during shutdown.
