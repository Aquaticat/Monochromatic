//! What: Raw and generated `git ls-files --stage -z` listings through the listing parser
//!       and the staged delta a `git add` prediction computes from two of them.
//! Why: Listing pathnames are chosen by whoever writes the repository and may hold tabs,
//!      spaces and bytes that are not UTF-8; the delta decides which files the content
//!      policies read.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! fuzz(bytes, data => { checkStageRecords(data); checkGeneratedListings(data); });
//! ```
