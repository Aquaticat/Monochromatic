# git-policy-cli-fuzz

Coverage-guided checks for the native cli-git wrapper's pure boundaries.
The subject is `package/git-policy/cli/src/native`;
nothing here starts Git or touches a repository.

## Targets

### `global_arguments`

Runs `global_layout` over two views of every input:
the bytes split at NUL into arguments,
and the bytes mapped to real Git option,
command,
and boundary tokens.
It checks that the arguments are unchanged,
that the result is repeatable,
that the boundary token has the kind the outcome claims,
that the global prefix alone names no command,
and that nothing after a decided boundary changes the result.

### `config_loading`

Runs `classify_config_loading` over the same two views.
Skipping configuration skips policy,
so it checks that only native queries,
option errors,
and an independently restated list of inspection commands skip,
that an absent or unknown command never skips,
and that any `branch` or `tag` invocation gaining a mutating flag in first position requires configuration.

### `config_schema`

Builds a valid `cli-git.config.jsonc` document from every input together with the settings it must parse to,
and compares the schema's result with that expectation.
Inputs that are UTF-8 are also parsed as written.
An accepted document must satisfy the registry-order and bound invariants
and survive being restated canonically.
A rejection must render as one `config-invalid` JSON line that decodes back to the same message.

## Controls

`mise run //package/git-policy/cli.fuzz:test` runs the generator controls.
They count that the generators reach every layout outcome,
both loading decisions,
and non-default accepted configurations,
so an invariant that is never reached cannot pass unnoticed.

The `fuzz_target!` input looks like a closure signature but is macro input grammar.

## Campaigns

`mise run //package/git-policy/cli.fuzz:smoke` builds AddressSanitizer targets with the read-only nightly compiler,
runs the controls and Clippy in the same bounded container,
then fuzzes each target for 30 seconds without host mounts
under 2 GiB,
2 CPUs,
128 PIDs,
and a 4,096-byte input limit.
A target must exit 0 and report at least one executed unit.
Corpora,
artifacts,
and logs are retained under `target/verification/campaign-*`.

Retain and replay minimized failures,
and convert them into deterministic tests beside the subject.
These targets do not cover real-Git resolution,
forwarding,
configuration file reading,
or the management grammar.
