/**
 Snapshot inputs for the Markdown linter the native wrapper's `markdown/autofix` policy starts as a child process:
 the linter crate's sources, the JSONC crate it shares with the wrapper, and the registry dependencies its own
 lockfile names.

 The gate image builds the linter from these sources in a stage of its own, on the same audited base as the
 wrapper, and copies only the executable into the test image. The container has no network, so the registry
 sources are vendored on the host from the Cargo cache, as the scanner's are. A binary built on the host is never
 copied in: the host's C library is newer than the image's.
 */
// The bin scripts sit outside the package tsconfig's include list, so type-aware lint checks them in an inferred
// program that loads no ambient Node types; this reference loads them, so `process` and `node:` imports stay typed
// in this file on its own instead of depending on a sibling module that carries the same reference.
/// <reference types="node" />
