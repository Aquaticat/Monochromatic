//! What: The fail-closed failure of reading or recovering durable transaction state.
//! Why: Malformed, unsafe or contradictory state is never guessed at or deleted: the command
//!      stops with exit status 2 and a message naming the path, and the state stays for
//!      inspection (`CommitTransactionRecoveryError` in the incumbent; implementation plan,
//!      "Commit transactions and recovery").
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! throw new CommitTransactionRecoveryError(`Unsafe transaction registry: ${root}`);
//! ```

/// What: One recovery failure with its complete, human-readable message.
///       A tuple-like `struct` holds one unnamed field.
/// Why:  Every site that fails closed knows what it found and where; the message is the
///       whole diagnostic.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// class CommitTransactionRecoveryError extends Error {}
/// ```
