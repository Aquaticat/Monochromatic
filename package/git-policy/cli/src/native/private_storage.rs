//!       exclusive no-follow creation with private modes, file and directory sync, and
//!       no-follow reads that refuse links and non-regular files.
//! Why: Lock records, transaction journals and capture records must survive a crash in a
//!      readable state, must never be written through a planted link, and must be private to
//!      the account. The incumbent's `src/trust/registry-io.ts` defines these semantics; both
//!      wrappers write and read the same files.
