//! What: Which rules file the scanner loads, and which candidates it is given.
//! Why: The scanner library filters nothing; the standalone scanner and the TypeScript
//!      policy applied these choices around it. They are restated here once, as pure
//!      functions: the rules-file precedence (`FORBIDDEN_STRINGS_RULES`, else
//!      `forbidden-strings.local.txt` in the repository root) and the paths that hold
//!      the rules themselves, which would otherwise match their own content.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // const rules = rulesSource(process.env.FORBIDDEN_STRINGS_RULES, repositoryRoot);
//! // const eligible = candidates.filter(candidate => isScannable(candidate, rulesCandidatePath(rules.path, repositoryRoot)));
//! ```
