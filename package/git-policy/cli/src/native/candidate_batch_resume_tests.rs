//! What: A control for a byte source that reports its end and later yields more bytes.
//! Why: A pipe stays ended once it ends, but the reply reader accepts any buffered source,
//!      and a file that is still being written does not. Without the explicit check that
//!      all declared content bytes arrived, such a source could have its later bytes
//!      read as the closing line feed, and shortened content would be accepted.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // expect(() => readBatchReply(growingSource('…blob 6\nabc', '\n'), oid)).toThrow('reply-truncated');
//! ```
