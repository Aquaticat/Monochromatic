//! What: Rename-published owner-lock directories with process-birth ownership: acquisition
//!       with dead-owner retirement, an unbounded wait while the owner lives, and release by
//!       rename before deletion.
//! Why: The landing, reservation, hook, capture and push locks all work this way in the
//!      incumbent (`src/owner-lock/owner-lock.ts`) and in its hook dispatcher, and both
//!      wrappers contend on the same directories while both are installed. A published lock
//!      always names its owner because its candidate is complete before the rename.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
