//! What: Parse the NUL-delimited stage records of `git ls-files --stage -z`, find the paths
//!       one staging operation changed, and turn them into candidate records.
//! Why: `git add` is checked before Git runs it, by replaying it on a private copy of the
//!      index. The paths it would stage are exactly those whose index records differ
//!      between the copy before and after the replay. Comparing complete records, conflict
//!      stages included, finds a resolved conflict like any other change, and an unrelated
//!      conflict elsewhere in the index never stops the comparison. Pathnames stay the raw
//!      bytes Git printed.
//!
//! Git 2.56.0 (`builtin/ls-files.c`, `show_ce`) prints, with `--stage -z`:
//! `<mode> SP <object> SP <stage> TAB <path> NUL`.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // const before = parseStageRecords(stdoutBefore); const after = parseStageRecords(stdoutAfter);
//! // const paths = stagedDelta(before, after);
