//! What: The panic hook of the executable: one line naming where an internal error
//!       happened, never its message.
//! Why: The linked scanner catches a matcher panic and reports it as a failed scan, but
//!      Rust runs the process's panic hook before the panic can be caught, and the default
//!      hook prints the panic's message, which can hold bytes of the file being scanned.
//!      The scanner's own executable installs a hook that prints nothing; this one keeps
//!      the source location, which holds no repository content, so a wrapper defect is
//!      still visible.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // process.on('uncaughtException', () => process.stderr.write('cli-git: internal error ...\n'));
//! ```

/// What: `Write` adds `write_all` to the standard error stream.
/// Why:  The notice is written whole, as bytes.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// // process.stderr.write(text)
/// ```
use std::io::Write;
/// What: `Location` is a source file, line and column; `PanicHookInfo` is what a panic
///       hook is given, its message and its location.

///       `Option<&Location<'_>>` is "a borrowed location or nothing"; `'_` lets the
///       compiler choose how long the borrow lasts.
/// Why:  A pure function of the location can be checked exactly.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// function panicNotice(location?: Location): string;
/// ```
