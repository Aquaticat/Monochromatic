//! What: The linter the executable gives `markdown/autofix`: `monochromatic-lint`, found
//!       on the invocation's PATH and started once per candidate as
//!       `monochromatic-lint --config=<file> --stdin --stdin-filename=<path> --fix`
//!       from the repository's top level, with a time bound and output caps.
//! Why: This is the plan's stream contract (`doc/planning/unified-linter.md`, section
//!      "Distribution and consumers"; `doc/planning/cli-git-rust-implementation.md`,
//!      lines 181 to 189). The program and its one-rule configuration are found and
//!      written once per invocation, when the first candidate needs them, so a command
//!      with no Markdown candidate never needs the linter. Every option is written as one
//!      `--name=value` argument, so a pathname that starts with `-` stays a value.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // const run = await processLinter(env).lint({ topLevel, options, path, source });
//! ```
