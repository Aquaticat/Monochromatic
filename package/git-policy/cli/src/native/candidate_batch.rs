//! What: Read one `git cat-file --batch` reply from a byte stream, with no process involved.
//! Why: Object bytes are untrusted input that may contain anything, including text that
//!      looks like a reply header. The reply is therefore framed only by the header's
//!      declared size, never by searching content, and every malformed shape is a
//!      typed failure instead of a guess.
//!
//! Git 2.56.0 (`Documentation/git-cat-file.adoc`, "BATCH OUTPUT") prints, per request line:
//! `<oid> SP <type> SP <size> LF <contents> LF`, or `<request> SP missing LF`.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // const header = await readLine(stream); const body = await readExactly(stream, size);
//! ```
