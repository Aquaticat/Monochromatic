/// What: `OsString` is owned operating-system text of raw OS bytes (sibling `String`
///       must be UTF-8).

/// Why:  `args_os`/`vars_os` never decode, so non-UTF-8 arguments neither panic nor
///       change. A forwarded command replaces this process and never reaches the exit.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// function main(): never { process.exit(runProcess(argv, env)); }

    //       owned list. `Vec<OsString>` is that list type.
    // Why:  Git receives only the caller's arguments, in order.
