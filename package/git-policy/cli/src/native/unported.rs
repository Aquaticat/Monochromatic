//! What: The work of the installed cli-git that this executable does not do yet, as one
//!       typed list, and the notice printed when a command needs any of it.
//! Why: A command that needs unported work must stop with exit status 2 and say what is
//!      missing. Forwarding it instead would run the command without the protection the
//!      installed wrapper gives it, and nobody would see that it happened.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // process.stderr.write(unportedNotice({ kind: 'commit-transaction' }, 'commit')); process.exitCode = 2;
//! ```

/// What: `use` brings names from sibling files into this file; `super::` means "the parent
///       module", where every sibling file of this crate is declared.
/// Why:  A refusal can name a policy, a lifecycle trigger, or an engine "unavailable" answer.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// import { triggerName } from './policy_trigger.ts';

///       expect: `String`, which must be valid UTF-8.
