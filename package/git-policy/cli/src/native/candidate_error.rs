//!      was not checked), and callers branch on the cause without parsing message text.

//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! class CandidateError extends Error { readonly failure: CandidateFailure }
//! ```

/// What: Why candidate listing or reading failed.
///       `#[derive(...)]` generates copying, debug printing and `==`.
/// Why:  The policy engine maps causes to engine-failure codes, and tests name the
///       exact cause instead of matching diagnostic wording.

/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// type CandidateFailure = 'git-not-started' | 'git-failed' | 'listing-malformed' | ...;
