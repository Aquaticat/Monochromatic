//! What: `git cli-git fix`: run policy passes over the selected files, apply the
//!       corrections they propose in memory until a pass proposes none, then install the
//!       corrected files into the worktree when that last pass is clean.
//! Why: The installed wrapper's `direct-fix.ts` and `direct-fix-convergence.ts` decide the
//!      behaviour: only the last pass is reported, a fix summary follows it only when a
//!      file changed, nothing reaches the worktree unless the last pass exits 0, and a
//!      fix that cycles or keeps changing ends with one engine failure. The bounded loop
//!      itself is `policy_convergence::converge`; this module supplies its passes.
//!      Corrections replace whole file contents in memory instead of being staged into
//!      the private index, so a pass starts no Git process for them.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // const result = await runDirectFix({ gitGlobalArgs, pathspecs, policyOptions });
//! ```
