//! What: The lifecycle points at which policies run, which shipped policy runs at which
//!       point, and which points this executable can serve.
//! Why: A policy runs only for the triggers it declares. A trigger whose lifecycle is not
//!      ported must be answered as "unavailable", never as an empty result that would read
//!      as "checked and clean".
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // type PolicyTrigger = 'pre-forward' | 'post-commit' | 'manual-push' | 'direct-check' | 'direct-fix';
//! ```

/// What: `use` brings a name from a sibling file into this file; `super::` means "the

///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
