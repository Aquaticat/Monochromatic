//! What: A repository path as an event reports it: readable text, and the exact bytes
//!       as well when those bytes are not UTF-8.
//! Why: Git allows any bytes in a file name, and a JSON string can hold only text. An
//!      event keeps `path` as text with replacement characters, so every existing reader
//!      works unchanged, and adds an optional `pathBytes` field, base64 encoded, only for
//!      a name that is not UTF-8, so a reader that needs the file can still find it.
//!      This is option C of `doc/planning/cli-git-rust-open-decisions.md`, section
//!      "Non-UTF-8 paths in events and journals", which the owner adopted.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // const path = eventPath(bytes); line.path = path.text; if (path.exact) line.pathBytes = base64(path.exact);
//! ```
