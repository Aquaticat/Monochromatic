//! What: The `exclude` option of `markdown/autofix`: gitignore-syntax patterns, relative to
//!       the repository's top level, naming candidates the policy leaves alone.
//! Why: The installed wrapper filtered candidates with the `ignore` package before starting
//!      the linter (`rewrite-candidates.ts`, `rewriteCandidates`), so an excluded file never
//!      starts a linter and never fails for one. The linter evaluates its own copy of the
//!      option with the `ignore` crate's gitignore matcher and a walk over ancestor
//!      directories (`package/linter/monochromatic-lint/src/markdown_lfs_patterns.rs`); this
//!      module uses the same matcher and the same walk, so both agree on every path.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // const excluded = ignore().add(exclude); if (excluded.ignores(candidate.path)) continue;
//! ```
