//! What: Startup recovery as a step of a wrapped or direct command: recover, then report how the
//!       command may go on.
//! Why: Every command that reads the repository location recovers dead transactions first. A
//!      guarded command beside a live transaction is still refused until index writers coordinate
//!      with live transactions; a read-only command goes on. A legacy directory or a recovery
//!      failure stops the command with exit 2, as the incumbent's `content-unavailable` engine
//!      failure does.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! await recoverCommitTransaction({ args, gitPath, identity }); // throws CommitTransactionRecoveryError
//! ```
