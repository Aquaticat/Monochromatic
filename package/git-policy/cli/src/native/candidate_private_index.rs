//! What:
//!  A private copy of the real index,
//!  in its own directory beside it,
//!  removed when
//!       the copy is dropped.
//! Why:
//!  Predicting what `git add` would stage means running it against an index nobody
//!      else reads,
//!  so the real index never changes before the policies have answered.
//!      The copy keeps the real index's access and modification times:
//!  Git re-reads an
//!      entry whose stat data is not older than the index file,
//!  and a copy with a fresh
//!      time would make it trust stat data from the same second as a later edit of the
//!      same size,
//!  so the prediction could miss that edit (the installed wrapper's
//!      `index-file-timestamps.ts`,
//!  issue #544).
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // await using index = await createPrivateIndex(realIndexPath); // removed on dispose
//! ```
