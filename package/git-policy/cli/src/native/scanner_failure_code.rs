//! What: Which engine failure code each failure of the candidate and scanner layers carries.
//! Why: An engine failure names its cause. `content-unavailable` means candidate bytes or a
//!      repository fact could not be read; `policy-incomplete` means the policy's own
//!      machinery failed. Deciding the code here, beside the failures, makes every policy
//!      that reads candidates or scans them report the same code for the same cause.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // const code = scanRunFailureCode(error); // 'content-unavailable' | 'policy-incomplete'
//! ```

///       was unavailable. A stale candidate is different: its content can be read through
///       a fresh version, and what failed is the calling pass, which kept a candidate
///       across an invalidation. Without a catch-all arm, a cause added later does not
