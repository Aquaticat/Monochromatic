//! What: Controls for the `exclude` patterns of `markdown/autofix`.
//! Why: Gitignore semantics decide which candidates the policy leaves alone: directory
//!      patterns, anchoring, negation, and a negated file below an excluded directory.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // expect(ignore().add(['package/ssg/']).ignores('package/ssg/a.mdx')).toBe(true);
//! ```
