//! What: The events one policy pass produces, and their JSON Lines rendering.
//! Why: Agents and scripts read these lines from wrapper standard error and from
//!      `git cli-git check|fix` standard output. Each event is one compact JSON object with
//!      the incumbent's field names and field order, so existing readers parse native
//!      events unchanged. Events are numbered when rendered, so a list of events always
//!      prints with consecutive numbers in emission order.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // process.stderr.write(renderPolicyEvents(result.events));
//! ```
