//! What:
//!  Pure decision of the require-root policy:
//!  commands run from the repository root.
//! Why:
//!  Running Git from a subdirectory makes pathspecs mean something else.
//!  The policy
//!      rejects that,
//!  except for commands that need no repository.
//!  This file decides from
//!      the argument list alone which commands are exempt,
//!  and from two paths the caller
//!      measured whether the directory is the root.
//!  It reads no file and starts no process.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // decideRequireRoot(args): 'exempt' | 'needs-root'
//! // resolveRequireRoot({ effectiveDirectory, repositoryRoot }): 'pass' | Violation
//! ```
