//! What: Find the `monochromatic-lint` executable the `markdown/autofix` policy runs, on
//!       the PATH of the invocation's environment.
//! Why: Repository configuration cannot choose the program (`doc/planning/cli-git-rust-implementation.md`,
//!      lines 181 to 189: first-party linter selection is installation wiring). The linter
//!      is installed through mise as `cargo:monochromatic-lint`, and mise exposes installed
//!      tools on PATH, through `mise activate` or its shims directory; real Git is found on
//!      PATH the same way. Only absolute PATH entries are searched: a relative or empty entry
//!      names a directory relative to where the command runs, usually inside the very
//!      repository whose content the linter checks, and that repository must not be able to
//!      supply the program.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // const linter = findLinter(env.PATH); // '/home/u/.local/share/mise/shims/monochromatic-lint'
//! ```
