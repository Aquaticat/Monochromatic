//! What: The linter configuration the `markdown/autofix` policy hands `monochromatic-lint`:
//!       one block that selects the policy's rules for Markdown and MDX files, written once
//!       per invocation to a private temporary file outside the repository.
//! Why: The plan's contract (`doc/planning/unified-linter.md`, section "Distribution and
//!      consumers") is a one-rule configuration in a temporary file created with a proper
//!      temporary-file call, passed with `--config`, so a configuration the repository
//!      keeps for its own linting never changes what the commit-time policy does. Each
//!      rule runs at `warn`, so a finding the fixes leave is a record on standard error
//!      and exit status 0, and only a run that could not finish exits non-zero. The
//!      document is built as a value and printed by the JSONC emitter, so no pattern text
//!      can break out of its string.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // const file = await writeOneRuleConfiguration({ rules, exclude }); // '/tmp/cli-git-markdown-Ab12Cd.jsonc'
//! ```
