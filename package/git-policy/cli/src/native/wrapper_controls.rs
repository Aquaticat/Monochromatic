//! Why: Git refuses options it does not know, so every control must be gone before Git runs,
//!      and every policy decision must read the arguments without them. A control is
//!      recognized only where Git itself would look for an option, and it is removed by its
//!      position, never by its spelling, so an equal-looking value or path is kept.

//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):

//! // const { args, keepGoing, escapedPolicyIds } = parsePolicyControls({ args: rawArgs });
