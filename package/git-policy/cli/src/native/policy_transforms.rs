//! What: The fixed argument transforms of a forwarded command, in their fixed order:
//!       atomic push, commit-only, status hints off.
//! Why: These are not policies: they have no severity and cannot be configured. They add
//!      `--atomic` to `git push`, `-o` to `git commit` and `-c advice.statusHints=false`
//!      before `git status`, and the commit-only transform can reject a commit. The
//!      decisions belong to the pure rule cores; this module runs them in order and
//!      fetches the two repository facts commit-only may ask for.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // const { args, events, complete } = await applyFixedTransforms({ args, rawArgs, sequence });
//! ```

/// What: `use` brings names from sibling files into this file; `super::` means "the parent
///       module", where every sibling file of this crate is declared.

///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
