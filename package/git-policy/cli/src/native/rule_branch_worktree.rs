//! What: Pure decision of the branch-worktree-only policy: a new branch starts in its own
//!       linked worktree, not in the current one.
//! Why: `git branch <name>`, `git checkout -b`, `git switch -c` and Git's guess of a remote
//!      branch all create a branch in the current worktree. The policy rejects them and
//!      points at `git worktree add -b`. This file decides from the arguments alone, names
//!      the one repository query the guess needs, and reads that query's answer. It starts
//!      no process.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // decideBranchWorktree(['switch', '-c', 'topic']) => { kind: 'creates', command: 'switch' }
