//!       encoding and parsing live in `transaction_journal_encode.rs` and
//!       `transaction_journal_parse.rs`.
//! Why: State files are created exclusively and never rewritten, so a crash leaves the newest
//!      complete state readable; recovery in either wrapper reads the records the other wrote
//!      (`src/policy-engine/commit-transaction-journal-states.ts` and
//!      `commit-transaction-journal-parse.ts`). Every missing or mistyped field fails closed
//!      with the record and field named.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! const preparing = parsePreparingRecord(bytes); await writeJournalRecord({ directory, filename, record });
//! ```
