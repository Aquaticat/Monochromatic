//! Why: Durable strings such as process birth identities are produced by `.trim()` in the

//!      `str::trim` uses a different whitespace set (it trims U+0085 and keeps U+FEFF).
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):

//! text.trim()

///       no-break space, U+FEFF and every `Zs` character) and `LineTerminator` (LF, CR,
///       U+2028, U+2029); nothing else.

/// ```ts
/// /^\s$/u.test(character) // JavaScript's \s is exactly this set
