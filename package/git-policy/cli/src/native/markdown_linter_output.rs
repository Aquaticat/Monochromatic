//! What: Read what one `monochromatic-lint --stdin --fix` run produced: the fixed source on
//!       standard output, findings it could not fix as JSON Lines on standard error, and its
//!       exit status. The result is the fixed bytes and the remaining findings, or the reason
//!       the run cannot be trusted.
//! Why: The linter is a child process whose output is untrusted text. Its contract
//!      (`package/linter/monochromatic-lint/README.md`, `src/run_stdin.rs`, `src/run_output.rs`)
//!      is exit status 0 with the fixed source and warning records, because the policy's
//!      one-rule configuration gives the rule severity `warn`; 1 only for error findings or a
//!      warning limit, neither of which that configuration can produce; and 2 for a run that
//!      could not finish. Anything else, and any record that is not a finding of a selected
//!      rule, means the run cannot be trusted, so the policy fails instead of passing an
//!      unchecked file.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // const run = interpretLinterRun({ input, rules, finished }); // throws LinterOutputError
//! ```
