//! What: Ask real Git, in one query, which repository an invocation selects and where
//!       inside its worktree the command runs.
//! Why: The configuration root, the require-root policy and the worktree policies all need
//!      answers Git itself computes from `-C`, `--git-dir`, `--work-tree` and its
//!      environment. One `git rev-parse` prints all of them, so an invocation starts one
//!      Git process for these facts instead of one per fact, and the wrapper never
//!      re-implements Git's repository discovery or its `-C` chaining.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // const { identity, prefix } = parseLocationOutput(await git(locationQueryArguments(globalPrefix)));
//! ```

/// What: `use` brings names from sibling files into this file; `super::` means "the parent
///       module", where every sibling file of this crate is declared.
/// Why:  The identity part of the answer is read by the existing identity reader; this
///       module adds the one extra line.
///

/// ```ts
/// import { parseIdentityOutput } from './worktree_identity.ts';

///       expect: `String`, which must be valid UTF-8.

///       directory the command runs in. `&str` is borrowed text baked into the program.

///       root" is Git's own answer, with every `-C` and symbolic link already applied.
