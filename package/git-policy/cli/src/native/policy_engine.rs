//! What: Run shipped policies in registry order for one lifecycle point and settle the
//!       outcome: which events were produced and whether the command may proceed.
//! Why: Every lifecycle shares one execution contract: a policy runs only for the triggers
//!      it declares, at the configured severity, unless it is filtered out, escaped or off;
//!      the first error finding stops the pass unless the caller asked to keep going; and a
//!      policy or lifecycle this executable cannot evaluate is reported as unavailable,
//!      never as clean.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // const stage = await runPolicyStage({ policies, context, trigger, severities, selectedPolicyIds, escapedPolicyIds, keepGoing });
//! ```
