//! What: Parse the NUL-delimited raw records of `git diff-index` and `git diff-tree`.
//! Why: One listing process names every changed path with its mode, object and change
//!      kind, so no per-path Git process is ever needed. Pathnames are kept as the raw
//!      bytes Git printed; they are never decoded.
//!
//! Git 2.56.0 (`Documentation/diff-format.adoc`, "RAW OUTPUT FORMAT") prints, with `-z`:
//! `:<old mode> SP <new mode> SP <old oid> SP <new oid> SP <status> NUL <path> NUL`.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // const records = parseRawRecords(stdout); // [{ path, mode, change, object }]
//! ```
