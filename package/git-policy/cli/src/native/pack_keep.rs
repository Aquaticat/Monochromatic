//! What: The `.keep` files that protect a landing's migrated pack until the compare-and-swap,
//!       named by the message `cli-git <transaction-id>`.
//! Why: `git index-pack --keep=<message>` writes the `.keep` before the pack becomes visible, so
//!      no prune or repack drops the objects mid-landing; recovery finds a dead transaction's
//!      `.keep` by its message even before a landing record names the pack
//!      (`src/policy-engine/commit-landing-objects.ts`).
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! await removeTransactionKeeps({ objectDirectory, transactionId });
//! ```
