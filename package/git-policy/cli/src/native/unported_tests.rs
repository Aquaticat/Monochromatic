//! What:
//!  The exact notice of every refusal,
//!  and the mapping from the engine's answer.
//! Why:
//!  The notice is the only thing telling a person why their command did not run;
//!  a
//!      wrong or empty subject would send them looking in the wrong place.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // expect(unportedNotice({ kind: 'commit-transaction' }, 'commit')).toBe('cli-git: the commit transaction ...\n');
//! ```
