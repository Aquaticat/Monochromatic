//! What: The preparation and landing leases: capabilities a running wrapper passes to the
//!       Git it starts, so a nested wrapper invocation from a hook or `rebase --exec` proceeds
//!       under its ancestor instead of waiting for it.
//! Why: Without a lease a nested invocation would wait for the hook lock or landing lock its own
//!      ancestor holds, forever. Both wrappers format and validate the same leases
//!      (`src/hook-dispatch/preparation-lease.ts`, `src/index-lock/landing-lease.ts`), because a
//!      hook started by one wrapper may run the other.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! if (await hasValidInheritedLease(process.env)) { /* skip recovery and the hook lock */ }
//! ```
