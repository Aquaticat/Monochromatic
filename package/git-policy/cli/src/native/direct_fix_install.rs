//! What:
//!  Install the corrections a converged `git cli-git fix` settled on into the
//!       worktree,
//!  all of them or none,
//!  and never touch the index.
//! Why:
//!  The installed wrapper's `direct-fix-install.ts` decides this protocol:
//!  every
//!      corrected file must still hold the bytes the fix read,
//!  each replacement is written
//!      beside its file and renamed over it,
//!  a copy of the old file is kept until the end,
//!      and the real index must hold the same bytes afterwards.
//!  Any failure restores every
//!      file already replaced.
//!  Failure messages name no file,
//!  because a pathname can hold
//!      the text a scan exists to keep out of output.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // await installDirectFix({ scope, changedPaths, finalCandidates, originals });
//! ```
