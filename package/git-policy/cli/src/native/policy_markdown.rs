//! What: The optional `markdown/autofix` policy: every Markdown candidate the lifecycle
//!       offers is passed through `monochromatic-lint --fix` with the policy's rules; a
//!       changed source is reported, and corrected on `git cli-git fix`, and each finding
//!       the fixes leave is reported as it is.
//! Why: The installed wrapper's `markdownLintPolicy` (`package/git-policy/markdown-lint/src`)
//!      decides the behaviour: deleted files, symbolic links and submodules are skipped,
//!      and so are excluded paths before any linter starts and contents that are not UTF-8;
//!      candidates are linted one at a time, in candidate order; the codes and words of
//!      both findings are kept. Two things differ by design: the extension test is the
//!      linter's own (`.md` and `.mdx`, exact case), so no file is sent that the linter
//!      refuses, and the autofix finding names the program that now runs.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // const findings = await rewriteCandidates({ rules, exclude, repositoryRoot, canApplyPatches, candidates });
//! ```
