//! What: Recovery of one dead-owner transaction from its schema-version-2 records.
//! Why: Without a landing record the real index and refs were never touched: recovery releases
//!      the `index.lock` the transaction provably created and removes its `.keep` files, shadow and
//!      directory. With a landing record (the caller holds the landing lock) it decides from
//!      `ref-updated.json` or the reflog nonce whether the commit landed, then discards the
//!      attempt or completes it: index, conclusion cleanup, added-path copies. Missing evidence
//!      fails closed and keeps the directory (`src/policy-engine/commit-transaction-recovery-landing.ts`).
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! await recoverDeadTransaction({ directory, transactionId, ownerPid, gitPath, effectiveCwd });
//! ```
