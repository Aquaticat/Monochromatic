//! What: The optional `security/forbidden-strings` policy: scan every candidate's exact
//!       bytes and pathname through the linked scanner and report each match, redacted.
//! Why: The installed wrapper wrote candidate bytes to temporary files, started the
//!      scanner executable and parsed its standard error. Here the same scanner is a
//!      library: rules are loaded once per invocation, only when a candidate can be
//!      scanned, and each finding carries the scanner's masked display path and an
//!      opaque rule name, never the matched text. A scan that could not complete ends
//!      the policy with the code of its cause, never as a clean result.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // const findings = await scanCandidates({ builtinRules, repositoryRoot, candidates });
//! ```
