//! What: Startup recovery of interrupted commit transactions for the invocation's worktree.
//! Why: Before configuration loads, and before read-only commands that already asked Git for the
//!      repository location, every dead owner's transaction is recovered or fails closed; live
//!      owners are skipped. The legacy single-journal directory is not recovered here: the
//!      command stops and says how to recover it with the previous executable (the owner's
//!      verdict, `doc/planning/cli-git-rust-open-decisions.md`, "Legacy single-journal directory").
//!      An empty registry costs one directory read and no Git process
//!      (`src/policy-engine/commit-transaction-recovery.ts`).
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! await recoverCommitTransaction({ args, gitPath, identity });
//! ```
