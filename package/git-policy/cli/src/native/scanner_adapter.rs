//! What:
//!  The repository's forbidden-strings scanner,
//!  linked in and loaded once per invocation.
//! Why:
//!  The TypeScript wrapper wrote each candidate to a temporary file,
//!  started the
//!      scanner as a child process and parsed its standard error.
//!  Here candidate bytes
//!      go straight to the scanner library,
//!  and its own typed findings come back.
//!      Nothing is re-derived:
//!  rule loading,
//!  the rule cache,
//!  matching,
//!  redaction and
//!      the fail-closed findings all stay the scanner's.
//!
//! What the linking executable owes the scanner (`package/cli/forbidden-strings/README.md`,
//! "In-process candidate scans"):
//!  an unwinding panic strategy,
//!  which this file checks at
//! build time,
//!  and a panic hook that prints no payload,
//!  installed before the first scan.
//! The scanner catches its own loader and matcher panics;
//!  this module adds no catch of its own.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // const scanner = CandidateScanner.load(rules, true); const scan = scanner.scan(candidate, bytes);
//! ```

///  The scanner library's public types:
///  its fixed-token cache diagnostic,

///       per-candidate result,

/// Why:
///   They are returned to callers unchanged,
///  so findings are never re-encoded.

// What: `const _: () = assert!(...)` is a check the compiler evaluates while building;
//       `cfg!(panic = "unwind")` is true only when panics unwind the stack.
// Why:  The scanner turns a matcher panic into a fail-closed finding by catching the
//       unwind. Under `panic = "abort"` there is nothing to catch and the process
//       would die mid-scan, so such a build is refused instead of shipped.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// // No equivalent: a build-time assertion about how thrown errors propagate.
