//! What:
//!  The `rulesFile` option of `security/forbidden-strings`:
//!  which file in the
//!       repository holds the scanner's private rules,
//!  written relative to the
//!       repository's top level.
//! Why:
//!  The user decided on 2026-10-05 that configuration names the rules file first,
//!  then
//!      `FORBIDDEN_STRINGS_RULES`,
//!  then the default file.
//!  A configured name is checked
//!      when the configuration is read:
//!  it must stay inside the repository by its words
//!      alone,
//!  so a configuration cannot point the scanner at a file elsewhere on the
//!      machine.
//!  A name that is missing on disk is not a configuration error;
//!  loading
//!      the rules reports it when the policy runs.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // const rulesFile = parseRulesFile(option); // throws RulesFileRefusal
//! ```
