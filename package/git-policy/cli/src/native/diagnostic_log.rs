//! What: Line-oriented debug and warning diagnostics on standard error, switched like the
//!       incumbent's console sink.
//! Why: The incumbent prints debug records only when `MONOCHROMATIC_VERBOSE=true` and warnings
//!      unless `MONOCHROMATIC_WARN=false` (`package/module/logger/src/sink/console.ts`), and its
//!      spec requires that diagnostics never corrupt a JSONL stream: each diagnostic is one
//!      complete line written in one call (`SPEC.md`, "Debug logging").
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! const l = tagged({ tag: 'cli-git' }); l.debug(message); l.warn(message);
//! ```
