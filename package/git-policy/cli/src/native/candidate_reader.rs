//! What: One long-lived `git cat-file --batch` process that answers every object read of an invocation.
//! Why: Starting Git costs far more than reading one object, so candidate bytes are read
//!      through a single process whose count does not grow with the number of files.
//!      Blob bytes are remembered by object name: a name always denotes the same bytes,
//!      so a remembered blob can never become stale.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // const reader = startObjectReader(git); const bytes = await reader.blob(oid);
//! ```
