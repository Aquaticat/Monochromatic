//! What: Run one child program to completion with a time bound and output caps: its
//!       input comes from a file, its two outputs go to files, and the parent polls it.
//! Why: The Markdown policy starts the linter once per candidate, and a child that hangs,
//!      floods its output or exits early must never hang or exhaust the wrapper. Files
//!      instead of pipes need no reader or writer threads: a child that stops reading its
//!      input cannot block the parent, a child that writes more than the cap is stopped
//!      when the parent sees the file grow past it, and a grandchild that keeps an output
//!      open cannot delay the parent once the child itself has exited. Every file is an
//!      anonymous temporary file that the operating system removes when it is closed.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // const run = await runBoundedChild({ executable, args, cwd, env, input, timeoutMs, maxStdout, maxStderr });
//! ```
