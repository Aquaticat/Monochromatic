/**
 Starvation reservation:
 a commit that keeps losing landing races reserves the next slot and lands within the bound,
 before a commit started while it held the reservation.

 The victim holds in its editor until the first winner lands,
 then pauses after each lost race through the test-only `race-lost` phase marker,
 so each further winner lands while it replays;
 after its `landing.reserveAfterLostRaces`-th lost race it holds the reservation.
 The scenario repository has no cli-git config,
 so that is the default of 1:
 the first winner alone makes the victim reserve.
