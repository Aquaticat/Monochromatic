# Read-only Slint IDE

Implementation in progress.
The accepted [0.x scope][scope] and [build approach][plan] define the completion criteria.
This package is not yet a completed application.
Use the [handover][handover] for current verification,
running-process details,
and the next implementation action.

## Implementation queue

- [ ] Source view and external-change correspondence.
- [ ] Live workspace tree and search.
- [ ] Required language-intelligence feature paths.
- [ ] Measured Helix-supported language inventory and private server state.
- [ ] Native interaction tests and behavior-difference documentation.

## Build boundary

Cargo tasks run in the existing native-app container with 2 GiB RAM,
2 CPUs,
a 512-process limit,
and a 4096-descriptor limit.
The container receives this package and a dedicated Cargo cache,
not the user's home or credentials.

Helix crates share a pinned upstream revision.
Helix code and runtime assets retain their own license obligations;
the application does not inherit Helix's modal commands or editing features.
