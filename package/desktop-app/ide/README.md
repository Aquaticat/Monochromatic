# Read-only Slint IDE

Implementation in progress.
The accepted [0.x scope][scope] and [build approach][plan] define the completion criteria.
This package is not yet a completed application.
Use the [handover][handover] for current verification,
running-process details,
and the next implementation action.

## Implementation queue

- [ ] Complete the source view:
  shaped selection/copy,
  initial real syntax,
  font fidelity,
  and native external-change correspondence pass;
  annotations and remaining keyboard navigation are pending.
- [x] Native tree,
  asynchronous file switching,
  and recent-file reveal.
  Sidebar resizing and event-driven directory invalidation remain parity work.
- [x] Combined path/content search.
- [x] In-file find.
  Plain literal,
       case-insensitive matching with a transient find bar;
  see [In-file find](#in-file-find).
- [ ] Required language-intelligence feature paths.
- [ ] Measured Helix-supported language inventory and private server state.
- [ ] Native interaction tests and behavior-difference documentation.

## Project startup

Run `monochromatic-ide PROJECT` for one explicit local root,
or `monochromatic-ide PROJECT --file FILE` to initially display a file inside it.
Relative `FILE` paths start at `PROJECT`,
not the shell's working directory.
`--help` and `--version` exit before filesystem or native-display startup.
The executable no longer substitutes example source when no file is selected.

Native tree and file switching pass callback tests and real nested Wayland input checks.
Long-distance reveal uses fixed-row windowing over native `ScrollView`;
see the [ListView investigation][listview].
Directory reads and later source opens run in bounded background workers.
Failed opens retain the displayed source and do not enter recent-file history.
Ctrl+0 through Ctrl+9 use session-local promotion and ancestor reveal.

## Combined search

Double-Shift opens transient search.
Filename matches precede content matches;
prefix the input with `%` to show only content results.
Up/Down wrap the selected result,
Enter or a click opens it,
and Escape or an outside click closes the overlay.
Content results navigate to their matching source line.
The scope is the last-focused tree directory or a focused file's parent,
falling back to the project root.

Input changes cancel old work immediately and debounce the next search by 150 ms.
The worker runs filename and content searches concurrently through ripgrep.
It retains at most 20 filename matches and 30 content matches,
with at most one matching line per file.
Filename matching is smart-case literal substring;
content matching is smart-case regular expression.
A content-search failure does not discard usable filename results.

Record and retained-diagnostic bounds limit memory,
not total bytes scanned or query duration.
The application kills and reaps cancelled search children;
inherited ripgrep configuration,
preprocessors,
and archive decompression are disabled.
Canonical scope validation is not an OS-enforced filesystem sandbox.
Native dark/light input and clipboard probes verify result opening and content-line navigation.
Headless tests cover late replies,
 close cancellation,
 pending-open focus,
 and result-model pointer lifetime.

## In-file find

Ctrl+F opens a find bar under the source view and focuses its input with the previous find text selected.
The bar exists only while finding;
it has no previous,
 next,
 or close buttons,
because Enter,
 Shift+Enter,
 and Escape cover those actions for a bar that only the keyboard can open.
Matching is incremental while typing.
Enter selects the next match and Shift+Enter the previous one,
wrapping at the ends of the file.
Escape closes the bar,
removes the highlights,
and returns focus to the source view.

The bar shows the active match and the total as `3/17`,
`0/17` when the selection is not on a match,
`No matches` in a heavier weight when nothing matches,
and a trailing `+` when the match list was cut off at its bound.
Accessibility tools get the same state as a sentence,
for example `Match 3 of 17`,
both as the find input's description and as a text element.
The bar uses the `search` role with the label `Find in file`.

### Find matching

Matching is plain:
the find text is compared literally,
ignoring case,
against the whole file.
Regular-expression punctuation has no special meaning,
and empty find text matches nothing.
Case folding is the Unicode simple case folding of the `regex` crate that Helix reexports;
no dependency was added.
Matching lives in one function,
`find_matches` in `src/find.rs`,
so its semantics can be replaced in one place.
Matches are ranges of source character positions,
the same unit as selection and copying.

### Deliberate differences from editord

editord delegates Ctrl+F to Chrome's find-in-page,
which matches through ICU collation search;
the measured semantics are in [the find matching plan][find-matching].
The user decided on 2026-10-05 not to reproduce that folding.
`tests/find_reference.rs` runs the production matcher against the captured Chrome 149.0.7827.54 corpus
in `tests/fixture/browser-find.json` and pins the exact set of differing cases,
so an accidental change of matching behavior fails the suite:

- `canonical-accent` and `plain-accent`:
  composed,
   decomposed,
   and unaccented letters do not match each other.
- `case-expansion`:
  `STRASSE` does not match `Straße`.
- `compatibility-ligature`:
  `office` does not match `oﬃce`.
- `dotted-i`:
  `i` does not match `İ`.
- `nbsp-as-space`:
  an ordinary space does not match a no-break space.
- `kana-script`,
   `kana-width`,
   and `kana-composed`:
  kana script,
   width,
   and voicing marks are not folded.
- `single-quote` and `double-quote`:
  straight quotes do not match curly quotes.
- `soft-hyphen`:
  a soft hyphen inside a word is not ignored.
- `combining-mark-only`:
  a lone combining mark matches wherever the file contains it.

The interaction also differs from the browser bar:
the bar sits under the source view and never covers source text,
it has no buttons,
and the active match is the reading selection while the bar is still open.

### Find behavior decisions

- The active match is the reading selection.
  Typing,
   Enter,
   and Shift+Enter set the selection to a match,
  so Ctrl+C in the source view copies its original text
  and the last active match stays selected after Escape.
  A selection that is not exactly one match leaves no active match.
- Typing selects the first match at or after the selection start,
  so extending the find text keeps the current match while it still matches.
  Enter continues after the selection end;
  Shift+Enter continues before the selection start.
- Only typing,
   Enter,
   and Shift+Enter move the selection.
  Reopening the bar,
  an external reload,
  and a file switch recompute the highlights and the count without moving it.
- Enter and Shift+Enter do nothing until matches for the displayed file,
  its current revision,
  and the current find text have arrived.
- After an external reload the selection follows Helix correspondence like any other selection.
  The active match stays active while its text survives;
  otherwise the count shows no active match,
  and the selection does not jump to another occurrence.
  Highlights for the old revision are hidden until matches for the new one arrive.
- Switching files while the bar is open,
  through the tree,
  a search result,
  or Ctrl+0 to Ctrl+9,
  keeps the bar open and recomputes matches for the new file.
  The find input keeps keyboard focus when it had it,
  and Ctrl+0 to Ctrl+9 work from the find input.
- Ctrl+F is ignored while the combined search overlay is open and while no file is displayed.
  Double-Shift opens combined search above an open find bar.
  Escape closes only the topmost surface:
  the overlay first,
  then the bar.
- Escape closes the bar from the tree and the source view as well as from the find input,
  and always moves focus to the source view.
- Empty find text clears the highlights and the count without reporting `No matches`.
- Revealing a match keeps the scroll offsets when the match is already visible.
  Otherwise its line is centered,
  and a column outside the view is placed 48 px from the left edge of the text.
  The offsets are assigned directly,
   without easing.
- The find text is one line;
  the toolkit input replaces pasted line breaks with spaces.
- The find input is the toolkit `LineEdit`,
  as in combined search,
  including its built-in clear icon while it has focus and text.

### Find painting

Match rectangles come from the same shaped rows as selection rectangles (`ShapedView::range`),
so marking a match never reshapes text and ligatures stay intact.
Each state uses two visible channels:

- another match has a translucent fill in the foreground color and a 1 px boundary;
- the active match has the selection background and selection ink and a 2 px boundary;
- a selection that is not a match has the selection colors without a boundary.

Other matches are drawn over a selection,
so they stay visible inside a larger selection such as select-all.
Match ranges are part of the frame stamp:
a different match list repaints the visible source tile once,
even though only the native rectangles read the matches.

### Find bounds

- Find text is limited to 1,000 characters;
  longer text shows a diagnostic in the bar.
- Files up to 64 MiB are searched,
  because the worker copies the source into one contiguous string for the scan;
  a larger file shows a diagnostic.
- At most 10,000 matches are retained (160 kB per list);
  the count then ends in `+`,
  and navigation wraps within the retained matches.
- One background job runs at a time on the `ide-in-file-find` thread,
  with at most one waiting request.
  A newer request replaces the waiting one;
  a running scan is not interrupted,
  but its reply is discarded.
- Requests and replies carry the file-open generation,
  the content revision,
  and the query generation;
  a reply that differs in any of them is discarded.
- Only matches inside the materialized rows and the horizontal raster tile become native rectangles.

`test:find` covers the matcher,
 navigation,
 worker,
 painting,
 and the pinned browser differences.
`test:native` drives the bar through real window key events,
including reload,
 file switch,
 and the search overlay.
`inspect:find-guards` removes each guard in a disposable copy and checks that its named test fails.

## Language module

The headless core in `src/language` drives Helix's language-server client on one worker thread.
It is not wired into the window yet.
The native layer owns one `LanguageWorker`:
it sends `open`, `reload`, `close`, `request`, and `request_hints` without waiting,
and polls `try_take_status`, `try_take_reply`, `try_take_diagnostics`, and `try_take_hints` from a timer.
Every result carries the file generation, content revision, and server process it answers;
the handle drops results for anything no longer displayed.
A command method returns `false` when the queue is full; send it again on the next poll.
`enter_project_directory` must run once at startup, before any thread or Helix call,
because Helix roots every server at the process working directory.

The TypeScript family uses the project's own TypeScript 7 server (`node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --lsp --stdio`);
a project without it shows the missing-executable state.
Server-initiated workspace edits are refused.
Every server launch passes through one launch policy in `src/language/launch.rs`;
the default spawns the server itself, without write confinement.

`test:language` runs the unit rules and sessions against the scripted server `ide-scripted-lsp`,
one child process per session.
`inspect:language` runs all five feature paths, a reload, and the stale-reply case
against real TypeScript and Rust servers on disposable projects.
`inspect:language-guards` removes the fencing, readiness, and edit-refusal guards in a disposable copy
and checks that their named tests fail.

## Fonts and appearance

Official variable roman and real italic fonts for JetBrains Mono and Inter are bundled under `asset/font`
with their original OFL notices.
The Slint compiler is configured to embed imported font bytes.
The UI binds to the system palette.
Native dark/light rendering and font isolation are verified.
Programming ligatures retain per-character caret,
selection,
and copy behavior.
Inter's default kerning,
continuous weights,
optical-size controls,
and real italic selection are covered by font-stack tests.
Native widget snapshots also verify intermediate weights and italic cache invalidation.
Inter's normal Slint UI request currently retains the optical-axis default,
not automatic optical sizing.
Idle DPI changes are covered by a native headless window-event regression.
Live system-theme change and physical-output scale migration remain to be verified.

## Current reader behavior

Copy selected source with Ctrl+C.
There is no read-only badge,
Copy button,
or permanent diagnostic footer.
Source positions,
painting,
and selection share native shaped-row geometry.

The displayed file is reread by a bounded background worker at 250 ms intervals.
External changes map the latest caret,
selection,
and viewport through Helix correspondence,
even while text remains selected.
Read failures retain the last readable source and show a diagnostic until recovery.
The concrete caret and replacement-selection cases in the accepted scope pass through the native GUI.
This polling boundary is not yet a workspace tree watcher or language-server synchronization loop.

## Build boundary

Application builds and tests run in the IDE container extending the repository's native-app image,
with 2 GiB RAM,
2 CPUs,
a 512-process limit,
and a 4096-descriptor limit.
The container receives this package and a dedicated Cargo cache,
not the user's home or credentials.
The source documentation/line-budget task invokes the repository's Rust linter separately.

The `runtime` task prepares pinned Helix grammars for the measured language inventory,
matching query assets,
and license notices beside built binaries.
It is a build-only operation,
not an application-triggered downloader.
The selection is the languages `tokei` measures as repository source or configuration
that Helix supports at the pinned revision,
plus the companion grammars their queries inject for content the repository contains.
[The runtime language plan][runtime-languages] records the measurement,
each grammar's revision and license,
and language-server presence on this host.
The published `manifest.json` lists the bundled grammars:
a file whose recognized language is not listed stays plain text,
while a listed grammar that fails to load is reported as a broken installation.

[runtime-languages]: ../../../doc/planning/slint-ide-runtime-languages.md

Helix crates share a pinned upstream revision.
Helix code and runtime assets retain their own license obligations;
the application does not inherit Helix's modal commands or editing features.
