//! Inlay placement probe: how far inline hint text would move source glyphs, tab ends, and vertical caret
//! targets, measured with the production shaper on the hints real servers returned for the inspection fixtures.
//!
//! Inline placement is simulated by splicing each label into the line at its position and shaping the result,
//! which is what a widened line looks like. Run with `--nocapture` to print the measurements the README cites.
