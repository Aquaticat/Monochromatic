//! Keyboard caret movement over graphemes, words, lines, and the whole text, at Unicode and line-end boundaries.

/// What: Import the production movement functions and Helix's rope through the library's public interface.
/// Why: The native key handler calls exactly these functions on the document's rope.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// import { Motion, lineRange, moved, wordRange } from 'ide-app/caret-motion';
/// import { Rope } from 'helix-core';
/// ```
use helix_core::Rope;
/// The movements under test.
use ide_app::caret_motion::{Motion, line_range, moved, word_range};

/// What: Apply one movement repeatedly and collect every position it visits;
/// `Vec<usize>` is a growable list of address-sized character positions (siblings: `[usize; N]`, `&[usize]`).
/// Why: A whole walk shows skipped or split graphemes in one readable assertion.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// function walk(source: string, start: number, motion: Motion): number[];
/// ```
