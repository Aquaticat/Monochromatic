//! Pixel tab-stop arithmetic and the one-byte tab projection, independent of fonts.

/// What: Import the production tab arithmetic and projection through the library's public interface.
/// Why: The shaper calls exactly these functions; the tests must not use a copy.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// import { TAB_SPACES, tabAdvance, tabSpacings } from 'ide-app/tab-stop';
/// import { projectLine } from 'ide-app/text-projection';
/// ```
use ide_app::{
    tab_stop::{TAB_SPACES, tab_advance, tab_spacings},
    text_projection::project_line,
};

/// What: `const` names a compile-time value; `f32` is a 32-bit float (sibling `f64`).
/// Why: Nine pixels is the space advance of the 15 px source font; any positive value exercises the rule.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// const SPACE = 9;
/// ```
const SPACE: f32 = 9.0;

/// Stops lie two space advances apart, matching the reference's `tab-size: 2`.
