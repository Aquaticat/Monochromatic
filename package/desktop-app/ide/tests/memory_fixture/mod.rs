//! Disposable fixture directories for the integration tests, in memory when the system has one.

/// Directory paths.

const MEMORY_DIRECTORY: &str = "/dev/shm";

/// What: A fresh disposable directory whose name starts with `prefix`, in `/dev/shm` when that
///       exists and the usual temporary directory otherwise. `tempfile::TempDir` removes the
///       directory when it is dropped.
/// Why: On btrfs, the first read of a freshly written file updates its access time inside a
///      filesystem transaction, and creating or removing files joins one too. While the machine
///      flushes, those calls waited in the kernel (btrfs `handle_reserve_ticket` and
///      `wait_current_trans`) for seconds, past the bounds the worker tests wait. Memory-backed
///      files never wait for the disk.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// function directory(prefix: string): TempDir { return existsSync('/dev/shm') ? mkdtemp('/dev/shm/' + prefix) : mkdtemp(tmpdir() + '/' + prefix); }
/// ```
pub fn directory(prefix: &str) -> tempfile::TempDir {

    {
