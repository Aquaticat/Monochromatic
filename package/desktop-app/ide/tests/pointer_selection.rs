//! Click counting and unit-wise drag extension for pointer selection, without a window.

/// What: Import Helix's rope and the production pointer-selection functions.
/// Why: The native pointer callbacks call exactly these functions on the document's rope.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// import { Rope } from 'helix-core';
/// import { CLICK_INTERVAL, CLICK_SLOP, ClickCounter, Granularity, extended, unit } from 'ide-app/pointer-selection';
/// ```
use helix_core::Rope;
/// The counter, its limits, and the drag rule under test.
use ide_app::pointer_selection::{
    CLICK_INTERVAL, CLICK_SLOP, ClickCounter, Granularity, extended, unit,
};
/// What: `Instant` is a point on a monotonic clock; adding a `Duration` gives a later point.
/// Why: Tests state the pause between presses instead of sleeping for it.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// const start = performance.now(); const later = start + 100;
/// ```
use std::time::{Duration, Instant};

/// Quick presses at one place count character, word, line, and then start over.
