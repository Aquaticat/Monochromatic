//! Companion grammars paint content that bundled languages embed: comments, expressions, and scripts.
//! Each fragment below is painted differently, or not at all, when its companion grammar is absent.

/// What: `mod syntax_support;` compiles the sibling file `syntax_support/mod.rs` into this
///       test program as a module named `syntax_support`.
/// Why:  Cargo builds each file in `tests/` as its own program, so shared helpers are
///       included as a module rather than imported from a package.

/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// import * as syntaxSupport from './syntax_support/mod';

///       nothing and passes unless it panics.
/// Why:  The comment grammar classifies issue references; the host language alone paints the
///       whole comment with one role.

/// ```ts
/// test('comment grammar paints issue references inside comments', () => { /* ... */ });
