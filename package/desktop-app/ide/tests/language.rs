//! Language module sessions against the scripted server: one child process per test, because
//! Helix roots servers at the process working directory.

/// What: `#[path = "..."]` names the file a module is read from. A test crate's root file looks
///       for its modules beside itself, so the modules kept under `tests/language/` are named
///       explicitly.
/// Why:  One test crate links the application library once and lets every test share the
///       support code without unused-code warnings.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// import * as support from './language/support';
/// ```
#[path = "language/support.rs"]
mod support;

/// Start states, the readiness gate, and the start deadline.
#[path = "language/start.rs"]
mod start;

/// External-reload synchronization for every synchronization kind and column unit.
#[path = "language/sync.rs"]
mod sync;

/// The five feature paths and the request states.
#[path = "language/requests.rs"]
mod requests;

/// Hint and pull-diagnostics requests asked again after a timeout.
#[path = "language/again.rs"]
mod again;

/// Replies to server requests; refusal of server-initiated edits.
#[path = "language/policy.rs"]
mod policy;

/// Crash, restart, file switches, launch refusal, and shutdown.
#[path = "language/lifecycle.rs"]
mod lifecycle;

/// What a clean open, request, close, and shutdown leave in the log and the process table.
#[path = "language/quiet.rs"]
mod quiet;

/// Working directory and enclosing-tree root handling.
#[path = "language/roots.rs"]
mod roots;
