//! The last lines each language server wrote to its standard error, kept for the record the
//! language worker writes when a server ends unexpectedly or fails to start.
//!
//! helix-lsp owns every server's standard-error pipe and passes each line on only as a `log`
//! record, at ERROR, so the log bridge (`relabel.rs`) sees every line whatever the log level shows
//! and hands it here, together with the end of the stream. Nothing here reaches a user-facing note:
//! the lines go only into the log, because a server's own output can hold paths and other details
//! of the machine.
//!
//! helix-lsp names a line's server by its configured name only, so lines are kept by name, and two
//! processes of the same name share one tail. A tail is removed when its lines are reported or the
//! worker stops the server itself; lines the same process still writes afterwards are dropped until
//! its stream ends, so they are never reported as the words of a later process of that name.

///      oldest line when a new one arrives.
