//! The application's own language runtime:
//!  parser libraries,
//!  highlighting queries,
//!  and the manifest.
//!
//! What:
//!  The one place syntax highlighting reads language files from.
//!  The application binary
//!       installs the table its build embedded ([`RuntimeSource::Embedded`]);
//!  tests and development
//!       tools,
//!  which have no embedded table,
//!  read the directory that `HELIX_RUNTIME` names
//!       ([`RuntimeSource::Directory`]),
//!  prepared by the package `runtime` task.
//! Why:
//!  Helix's own lookup (`helix_loader::runtime_file`) searches several directories and takes the
//!      first that has a file,
//!  with `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/helix/runtime` ahead of every other choice,
//!  so
//!      a stray file there silently replaced a bundled query.
//!  Nothing here calls that lookup:
//!  the
//!      application reads only its own files,
//!  whatever is installed elsewhere.
