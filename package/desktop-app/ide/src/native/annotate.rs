//! Inlay hints and diagnostics enter the window here. The renderer paints only snapshots stamped with the
//! displayed file generation and revision, and only their part inside the materialized rows.
//!
//! Snapshots live in `State::annotations`, an `ide_app::annotation::Annotations`. There are two ways in:
//!
//! - A poll that already holds the state mutably stores each polled snapshot with
//!   `annotations.accept_hints(displayed, text, snapshot)` or `accept_diagnostics(displayed, text, snapshot)`,
//!   and calls `render` once after releasing the state when either answered `true`.
//!   Accepting draws nothing by itself.
//! - [`set_annotations`] replaces both snapshots at once and renders; tests and the inspection path use it.
//!
//! Either way the render first brings the vertical mapping up to date (`rows::refresh`), keeping the view still
//! where rows appeared above it, then takes the visible part; the frame stamp repaints the source image only
//! when that part or its inks changed. Reloads and file switches need no call: a held snapshot stops matching
//! the displayed stamp and is no longer painted.
