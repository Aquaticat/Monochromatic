//! Inspection-only annotation injection: debug builds started with `IDE_INSPECT_ANNOTATIONS` naming a JSON file
//! install its hints and diagnostics for the displayed text, so nested-compositor frames can show them
//! without a language server. Release builds do not contain this module, and without the variable it does nothing.
//! A window started this way runs without the language worker (`servers_wanted` in the parent module): a worker
//! without servers still publishes "no problems" for the displayed text, which would replace the file's diagnostics.
//!
//! The file holds `{ "hints": [{ "position", "label", "kind" }], "diagnostics": [{ "source", "start", "end",
//! "severity", "code", "message" }], "delays": { "hints", "diagnostics" }, "reload_delays": { "hints",
//! "diagnostics" } }` with character offsets of the initial file; `severity` is `error`, `warning`,
//! `information`, `hint`, or absent, and `kind` is `type`, `parameter`, or absent.
//!
//! Without `delays` and `reload_delays` both snapshots are installed at once for the initial text; an external
//! change or a file switch makes them stale, and they disappear exactly as stale server snapshots do.
//! `delays` gives milliseconds after startup at which hints and diagnostics arrive separately, as from a server
//! that answers late. `reload_delays` makes them arrive again, that many milliseconds after each external
//! reload, stamped for the new text; the offsets are reused, so the change must not move the annotated text.
