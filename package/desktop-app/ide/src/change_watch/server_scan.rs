//! Find the project folders whose changes the language servers hear about, with the search's ignore rules.
//!
//! ripgrep lists the files the search would see (`src/search_process.rs`): it honours `.gitignore`, `.ignore`,
//! `.rgignore`, and skips hidden names. Every folder holding such a file is a source folder. `node_modules`,
//! `target`, and `.git` are never watched, even where no ignore file names them.
//!
//! Two properties of ripgrep decide how folders are rescanned (probed with ripgrep 15.2.0): a directory
//! given on the command line is listed even when an ignore rule names it, but ignore files of its parents
//! still apply to everything below it. So a new folder is classified by scanning its parent again, never by
//! scanning the folder itself. A folder with no entries at all cannot be classified by a file list; it is
//! watched while empty (provisionally), and its first change asks for its parent to be scanned again.
