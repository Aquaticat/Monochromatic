//! Retries while this user's inotify watch limit is reached.
//! The limit is shared by every program of the user, so a failed watch is usually not this application's

/// What: `Duration` is a time span; `Instant` a monotonic time point (`SystemTime`, the wall-clock sibling,
///       can jump when the clock is set).
