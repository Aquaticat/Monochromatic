//! Selected-text ink chosen from the actual selection background, not from the color scheme.
//!
//! The toolkit's fluent palette keeps one selection background (`#0078D4`) in both schemes
//! but flips its selection ink to black in the dark scheme.
//! Black on that blue has a WCAG 2 ratio of 4.64 and white 4.53, so the ratio alone does not separate them;
//! the light ink is the readable one on a saturated mid-tone, and it is what the light scheme already shows.

/// What: `const` names a compile-time value; `[u8; 4]` is a fixed array of four bytes
/// (red, green, blue, alpha). Siblings: `Vec<u8>` (growable) and `&[u8]` (borrowed, any length).
/// Why: A color always has exactly four channels, so the fixed array needs no allocation
/// and cannot have the wrong length.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// const WHITE: readonly [number, number, number, number] = [255, 255, 255, 255];
/// ```
const WHITE: [u8; 4] = [255, 255, 255, 255];

/// Opaque black, used only on light selection backgrounds.
const BLACK: [u8; 4] = [0, 0, 0, 255];

/// What: `f32` is a 32-bit float (sibling `f64` has twice the precision).
/// Why: White ink is kept while it reaches this WCAG 2 ratio, the minimum for large text and graphics;
/// above that background lightness black takes over and then has at least 7:1.
/// `f32` matches the other color arithmetic in this crate and is precise enough for a ratio.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// const WHITE_MINIMUM = 3;
/// ```
pub const WHITE_MINIMUM: f32 = 3.0;

/// What: Convert one stored sRGB byte into linear light between 0 and 1; `u8` is one byte
/// (siblings `u16`, `u32`), `f32::from` widens it without loss.
/// Why: Luminance is a weighted sum of linear light, not of stored bytes.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// function linear(channel: number): number {
///   const value = channel / 255;
///   return value <= 0.04045 ? value / 12.92 : ((value + 0.055) / 1.055) ** 2.4;
/// }
/// ```

/// WCAG 2 relative luminance of an opaque color, from 0 (black) to 1 (white). Alpha is ignored.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// function luminance([red, green, blue]: Color): number {
///   return 0.2126 * linear(red) + 0.7152 * linear(green) + 0.0722 * linear(blue);
/// }

}

/// WCAG 2 contrast ratio between two opaque colors, from 1 (equal) to 21 (black on white).
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// function contrast(first: Color, second: Color): number {
///   const [low, high] = [luminance(first), luminance(second)].sort((a, b) => a - b);
///   return (high + 0.05) / (low + 0.05);
/// }

///
/// `palette` is the toolkit's own selection ink. It is used only when the background is translucent,
/// because its lightness then depends on what is behind it, which this function does not know.

///

/// function legibleInk(background: Color, palette: Color): Color {
///   if (background[3] !== 255) return palette;
