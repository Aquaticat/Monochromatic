//! Scripted language server for integration tests: it speaks the protocol over standard streams
//! and produces, on demand, the states real servers do not produce reliably.
//!
//! It is configured only through `IDE_SCRIPTED_*` environment variables, which tests set through
//! the server definition's `environment` table. It never writes anything except the report file
//! a test names, and that file lives in the test's own temporary directory.

/// What the server can see and change from inside a sandbox.

/// What: `fn main()` is the program entry point; it returns nothing.
/// Why: All behavior lives in `server::run`; a failure there is printed to standard error, which
///      the client logs, and the process exits with a failure status.

/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// try { run(readScript()); } catch (error) { console.error(error); process.exit(1); }
/// ```
