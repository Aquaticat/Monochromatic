//! Remove the cache folders of other builds once they have gone unused for 30 days.
//!
//! What: Every build unpacks its parser libraries below `<cache>/monochromatic-ide/runtime/<key>/`,
//!       where `<key>` is a digest of its embedded files. [`mark_used`] renews `<key>/last-used`;
//!       [`remove_unused`] removes the other key folders whose last use lies more than
//!       [`UNUSED_LIMIT`] back.
//! Why: Each new build leaves a folder of about 33 MB behind. The user chose on 2026-10-06 to
//!      "Remove after N days unused", with 30 days.
//!
//! The rules:
//! - Last use is the modification time of `<key>/last-used`. The copy using that key renews it at
//!   every start and every parser load, so a copy that keeps running keeps its folder. A folder
//!   without the file (builds before this rule wrote none) is aged by its own modification time.
//! - The current key is never removed.
//! - Only direct children of the runtime folder are candidates, and only real folders (never
//!   symbolic links) named by 16 lowercase hexadecimal digits; anything else is left alone. When the
//!   runtime folder itself is a symbolic link, nothing is removed.
//! - A folder is first renamed to `.<key>.removing-<process>-<n>`, then removed with
//!   `fs::remove_dir_all`, which does not follow symbolic links: it removes a link itself, never what
//!   it points to (Rust standard library documentation of `remove_dir_all`). A removal cut short
//!   leaves only such a name, which the next start removes; the half-removed folder can never look
//!   recently used.
//! - Failures are logged and skipped: tidying the cache never stops the application.
