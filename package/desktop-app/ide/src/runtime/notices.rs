//! The license and notice texts embedded in the executable, as `monochromatic-ide --licenses`
//! prints them.

//! What: [`is_notice`] decides which embedded files are license or notice texts, [`collect`] checks
//!       their digests and adds one entry per Rust crate license text, and [`write`] prints each
//!       one in full under a heading.
//! Why: The user chose on 2026-10-06 that the executable shows the texts it carries through a
//!      `--licenses` flag; the files sit inside the executable, so nothing else can show them.

///       bytes borrowed from the executable or bytes owned by this value (a crate text decoded from

/// Why: Files print as they are; crate texts come out of one embedded list, so they are owned.
