//! The license texts of the Rust crates the executable is built from, as cargo-about collected them.
//!
//! What: The `notices` task runs cargo-about with the package's `about.toml` and `about.json.hbs`,
//!       which writes `target/crate-licenses.json`; `build.rs` embeds that file as [`PATH`]. [`parse`]
//!       reads it back, and [`CrateLicense::heading`] and [`CrateLicense::origin`] give each distinct
//!       license text the lines `--licenses` prints above it.
//! Why: The user chose on 2026-10-06 to carry every Rust crate's license text in the executable,
//!      collected by cargo-about. Its model is one entry per distinct license text with the crates
//!      that use it, so the listing prints one heading per text and names those crates under it.

/// A malformed list is an error naming the embedded file and the remedy.

/// What: Where the crate license list sits in the embedded table.
/// Why: Beside the other license texts below `LICENSES/`; `--licenses` prints it entry by entry
///      instead of as one raw file.

/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):

/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
