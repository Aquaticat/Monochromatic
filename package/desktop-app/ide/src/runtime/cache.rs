//! Unpack an embedded parser library into the private cache,
//!  exactly once per content.
//!
//! What:
//!  A parser library (a shared object) must be a file on disk,
//!  because the operating system's
//!       dynamic loader opens libraries by path.
//!  [`unpack`] writes one embedded library into
//!       `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/monochromatic-ide/runtime/<key>/grammars/<name>.so` and returns that path.
//! Why:
//!  The application is one executable;
//!  everything it needs at run time comes from inside it.
//!      Queries are read straight from the executable and never touch the disk;
//!  only libraries do.
//!
//! The rules that keep the cache safe:
//! - The cached file is compared byte for byte with the embedded bytes every time a library is
//!   loaded.
//!    A missing,
//!    shortened,
//!    or altered file is written again;
//!    it is never loaded as found.
//! - A write goes to a private file named after this process and a counter,
//!    then is renamed over the
//!   final name.
//!    A rename within one directory is atomic,
//!    so another process or thread opening the
//!   final name sees either the complete old file or the complete new one,
//!    never a partial write.
//!   Two first starts racing each other both write identical bytes;
//!    whichever rename lands last wins.
//! - Directories are created readable only by the user (mode 0700),
//!    files mode 0600.
//! - `<key>` is a digest of every embedded file,
//!    so builds with different files never share a cache.
