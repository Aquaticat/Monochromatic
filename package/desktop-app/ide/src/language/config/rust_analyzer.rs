//! rust-analyzer hears about file changes from the IDE instead of watching the project itself.
//!
//! Helix's built-in definition sets `files.watcher = "server"`, because Helix watches no files for its
//! servers. rust-analyzer then asks notify for a recursive watch of every workspace package folder, which
//! watches every folder below it, `node_modules` included, whatever `files.excludeDirs` says (measured:
//! 3081 watches on a 40-crate workspace with one 2001-folder `node_modules`). The IDE watches the
//! project's source folders for every server and forwards changes, so rust-analyzer is told to register
//! watchers with the client (`files.watcher = "client"`) and takes no watches of its own.

/// What: Set `files.watcher = "client"` in rust-analyzer's settings, keeping every other key.
/// Why: Set in code after the definitions are merged, because a merged `files` table replaces the whole
///      table, so a key set only in TOML could be lost together with its siblings.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// function watchThroughClient(configuration: Configuration): void
/// ```
pub(super) fn watch_through_client(configuration: &mut Configuration) {
    // What: `get_mut` borrows the definition for modification, or gives `None` when there is none.

    let settings = definition.config.get_or_insert_with(|| return json!({}));

    // Why: Indexing a value of another shape would stop the program, so a malformed table is replaced.

    // if (typeof settings !== 'object') settings = {}; settings.files ??= {};
