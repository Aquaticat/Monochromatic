//! The read-only client's answer to every request a language server can send it.
//!
//! helix-lsp only delivers these requests.
//!  An unanswered one stalls the server,
//!  so each method
//! gets a reply here:
//!  what a server needs to keep working is answered,
//!  every mutation is refused.

/// What:
///  `MethodCall` is helix-lsp's parsed form of a server-to-client request;
///  `jsonrpc` holds
///       the wire-level request,
///  parameter,
///  and error types;
///  `lsp` holds the protocol's data types.
/// Why:
///  The reply must be shaped exactly as the protocol defines for each method.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// import { MethodCall, jsonrpc, lsp } from 'helix-lsp';
/// ```
use helix_lsp::{MethodCall, jsonrpc, lsp};
/// What:
///  `Value` is any JSON value;
///  `json!` is a macro that builds one from literal syntax.
/// Why:
///  Replies travel as JSON,
///  and a few of them are fixed literals.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// type Value = unknown;
/// ```
use serde_json::{Value, json};

/// The exact sentence sent with every refused workspace edit.

///  What the worker must do besides sending the reply.
///  An `enum` with data is a tagged union.
/// Why:
///  Deciding is kept free of side effects so every reply can be tested without a server.

/// ```ts
/// type Effect =
///   | { kind: 'none' } | { kind: 'refreshDiagnostics' }
///   | { kind: 'registerWatchers'; registrations: [string, WatcherOptions][] }
///   | { kind: 'unregisterWatchers'; ids: string[] };
