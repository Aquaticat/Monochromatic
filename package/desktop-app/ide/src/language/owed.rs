//! Answers a server still owes: requests the worker made on its own (inlay hints, pull
//! diagnostics) that stayed unanswered through their retries, and the bounded rule for asking
//! again once the server sends anything.

/// What: An upper limit, as an unsigned 32-bit count (`u32`; siblings: `u64`, `usize`).
/// Why: One server is asked again at most this many times for one displayed text because it
///      sent a message while it owed an answer. Each such ask has its own bounded retries, so
///      the total number of requests per text and server has a fixed ceiling, which `u32` holds.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// const MAX_CATCH_UPS = 3;
/// ```
pub(super) const MAX_CATCH_UPS: u32 = 3;

/// What: Which of the worker's own requests one server left unanswered for the displayed text,
///       and how often it was already asked again. `bool` is a plain flag; `u32` is an unsigned
///       32-bit count. `Copy` lets a value be passed like a number; `Default` builds the value
///       with every flag off and the count at zero.
/// Why: A request that timed out, or was superseded through all its retries, must not be asked
///      in a loop, and must not be forgotten either. It is recorded here and asked again when
///      the server next shows that it processes messages.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// type Owed = { hints: boolean; pull: boolean; askedAgain: number };
/// ```
