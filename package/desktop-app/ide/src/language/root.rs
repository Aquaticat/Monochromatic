//! Which directory Helix would root a language server at, checked before anything is spawned.
//!
//! Helix derives the root from the process working directory, which it reads once and keeps
//! (`helix-stdx/src/env.rs`), walking up to the first `.git`, `.svn`, `.jj`, or `.helix`. The
//! application sets the working directory to the project root at startup; this module never
//! changes it. It asks Helix's own public functions what they will compute and refuses every
//! answer that is not inside the project, so a server is never started on an enclosing tree.

/// Helix's per-language configuration supplies the root-marker file names.
