# IDE design records

Durable visual records for the read-only Slint IDE in `package/desktop-app/ide`:
comparison pages that put built UI options side by side,
and the screenshots those pages show.
Each record is a question for the user, not shipped behavior.
Answers are given in the chat and then recorded in `doc/handover/slint-ide-0x.md` by the coordinating session.

## Layout

- `questions/<date>-<topic>.html`:
  one self-contained page per batch of questions.
  It loads nothing from the network and refers to images by relative path.
- `screenshots/<date>-<topic>/`:
  the frames for that page.
  PNG files are stored through Git LFS by the root `.gitattributes`.

## Index

### 2026-10-05 annotations as built

- Screenshots: `screenshots/2026-10-05-annotations-as-built/`
- Status: history.
  The user saw these frames and rejected the end-of-line hint placement on 2026-10-05:
  hints move to virtual rows above the code line,
  like editord,
  and diagnostic messages go on virtual rows too.

What the frames show,
from the `inspect:native <scheme> annotations` scene with injected hints and diagnostics
on branch `feat/ide-lsp-annotations` at `112dbd955`:

- `lines-dark-zoom.png` and `lines-light-zoom.png`:
  the first source lines enlarged.
  Inlay hints sit in boxes after the end of their line,
  in source order;
  a lettered severity marker (`E`, `W`) follows the text of a line where a diagnostic starts;
  each diagnostic is underlined in a style that differs by severity.
- `window-dark.png` and `window-light.png`:
  the whole window with the same annotations.
- `caret-card-dark.png` and `caret-card-light.png`:
  the caret inside an underlined range,
  with the card that lists the problems at the caret.

Known cost of the end-of-line placement,
visible on line 1:
several hints on one line are told apart only by their order.
The tree's selected row and the wide divider gutter in these frames predate the UI batch 2 answers.

### 2026-10-05 UI batch 2

- Page: [`questions/2026-10-05-ui-batch-2.html`](questions/2026-10-05-ui-batch-2.html)
- Screenshots: `screenshots/2026-10-05-ui-batch-2/`
- Status: awaiting the user's answers.

Questions on the page, with the slug used in file names:

- `divider-gap`: how the sidebar divider spends its 48 px minimum grab width.
- `divider-tab`: whether the divider is a keyboard Tab stop.
- `clear-icon`: whether the find and search inputs keep the toolkit's clear icon.
- `find-buttons`: whether the find bar gets previous, next, and close buttons.
- `selected-ink`: whether selected rows draw white text on the selection fill in both schemes.

## How the 2026-10-05 UI batch 2 screenshots were produced

### File names

`<question>-<option>-<scheme>-<state>.png` is a full 1100 by 660 frame.
`<question>-<option>-<scheme>-<state>-crop.png` is the rectangle the page shows,
cut at the same position and size for every option of that question and state.
Option `a` is always the `main` build.

### Builds

Every option is a real build of the application.
Option `a` of every question is `main` at `a630b237b`.
While the page was made, `main` gained language navigation.
On `main` at `2c64f0229`,
`ui/divider.slint`, `ui/tree.slint`, `ui/find.slint`, and `ui/search.slint` are identical to `a630b237b`;
`ui/app.slint` differs only by language navigation and an outside-project label,
and `ui/hover.slint` and `ui/references.slint` are new.
None of those additions appears in the captured scenes.
Every other option is one commit on the branch `prototype/ide-ui-variants`.
The tree of each commit is `a630b237b` plus only that option
(each commit restores the files of the previous option to `main`),
so checking one commit out builds that option alone.
The branch is throwaway prototype code and is never merged.

- `divider-gap` `b`, `5de82698c`:
  a 1 px divider cell with a 48 px grab area overlapping tree and source.
- `divider-gap` `c`, `106ab1ea4`:
  the line on the tree-side edge of the 48 px cell.
- `divider-gap` `d`, `6b74bf6c4`:
  a Material 3 style drag handle in the 48 px cell.
- `divider-tab` `b`, `4133d984b`:
  no Tab stop; Alt+Shift+Left and Alt+Shift+Right resize.
- `divider-tab` `c`, `b1cc52b81`:
  no Tab stop and no keyboard resizing.
- `clear-icon` `b`, `a79ac704f`:
  find and search inputs built on `TextInput`, without the clear icon.
- `find-buttons` `b`, `d8d28717a`:
  previous, next, and close buttons in the find bar.
- `selected-ink` `b`, `c1e3a8d2f`:
  white ink on the selection fill in the tree and the search list.

Options `c` and `d` of `divider-gap` and the whole `selected-ink` question were not in the original request.
The page states why each was added.

### Command, fixture, and window size

Each frame set comes from a fresh session of the package's native inspection task,
run in the worktree that holds the prototype branch:

```sh
# package/desktop-app/ide/mise.toml, task inspect:native
IDE_NATIVE_MCP_PORT=9378 mise run //package/desktop-app/ide:inspect:native dark scroll
IDE_NATIVE_MCP_PORT=9379 mise run //package/desktop-app/ide:inspect:native light scroll
```

- Fixture: `scroll`, a 203-line `fixture.ts` opened at start.
- Window: the task's default 1100 by 660 nested screen at scale factor 1;
  every session asserts that size before its first frame and every frame is checked to be 1100 by 660 pixels.
- Project contents: each session adds the same entries to its disposable project before any frame
  (`src/index.ts`, `README.md`, `package.json`, `an-extremely-long-file-name-that-reaches-the-divider.ts`)
  and asserts the resulting tree order.
- Sessions: one per question, option, and scheme, each quit through the compositor control socket.

### Input and capture

- Keys and clicks are seat input through the compositor control socket
  (`key`, `type`, `click` of `package/cli/nested-wayland-session`).
- Hover uses the Slint MCP tool `move_pointer`, which moves the toolkit pointer,
  because the control protocol has no plain pointer move.
  Its `wheel` command with zero notches moved the seat pointer,
  but the divider did not show hover afterwards in a control run.
- A frame is the compositor's `screenshot`, saved once two screenshots 250 ms apart are byte-identical.
- Frames with a focused text input are picked from 12 samples taken 120 ms apart:
  among samples seen at least twice, the one with the caret drawn.
  Every option therefore shows the caret in the same blink phase.
- The compositor writes nearly uncompressed PNG files.
  The stored files are re-encoded losslessly with ImageMagick and stripped of metadata;
  each stored frame was compared with its original and differs in no pixel.

### Scenes

Every scene starts from the state right after launch: `fixture.ts` open and selected in the tree,
the source focused, the sidebar 256 px wide.

- `divider-gap`:
  `idle` at start with the pointer parked at 1000, 450;
  `pointer-tree` with the pointer at 244, 152, on the `README.md` row 12 px left of the tree edge;
  `pointer-gap` with the pointer at 268, 152;
  `focus` after parking the pointer and pressing Tab twice (source to tree, tree to divider).
- `divider-tab`:
  `tree` after one Tab;
  `tab-1` after one more Tab;
  `shortcut` after Shift+Tab and then Alt+Shift+Right three times.
- `clear-icon`:
  `find-text` after Ctrl+F and typing `Latin`;
  `find-selected` after Escape and Ctrl+F again;
  `search-empty` after Escape and two Shift taps;
  `search-text` after typing `fixture`.
- `find-buttons`:
  `match` after Ctrl+F and typing `Latin`;
  `hover` with the pointer on the next button and `after-next` after one seat click on it (option `b` only);
  `nomatch` after Ctrl+A and typing `zzz`.
- `selected-ink`:
  `tree` at start;
  `search` after two Shift taps and typing `fixture`.

### What the frames do not show

- The mouse cursor: the screenshot holds the application surface only.
- Drags: the control protocol has no held-button drag.
- The right-click menu and input-method preedit of the `clear-icon` option `b` input,
  which the prototype does not rebuild.
- The references list from the language-navigation work:
  it is not in `a630b237b`, and showing it needs a running language server.
  On `main` at `2c64f0229` its selected row uses the same palette ink as the tree and the search list.
