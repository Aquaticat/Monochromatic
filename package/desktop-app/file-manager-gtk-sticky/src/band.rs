//! Pure sticky-band math: the whole replacement for the original's lane engine.
//!
//! The original (`package/desktop-app/file-manager/src/layout/lane.rs`) stores per-lane scroll
//! offsets, accumulates them along the parent chain, clamps each pane into every rail containing
//! it, and runs forward/backward relaxation passes so siblings never overlap. This module replaces
//! all of that with one stateless rule per pane, the same rule CSS `position: sticky` applies:
//! a pane rides the app scroll inside its own band, `y = band_top + clamp(scroll - band_top, 0,
//! band_height - PANE_HEIGHT)`. Non-overlap needs no solver because the tidy tree layout makes
//! bands within a column disjoint (a rail ends at the deepest direct child, and the next pane in
//! the same column starts below that subtree).

/// What: imports pane geometry constants.
/// Why: every band and position calculation shares the one pane-size source of truth.
