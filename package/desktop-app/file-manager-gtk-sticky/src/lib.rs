//! Library entry point for the sticky-band variant of the Monochromatic file manager.
//!
//! Same product model as `package/desktop-app/file-manager` (whose public `model`/`fs`/`types`
//! modules this crate reuses verbatim), with the original's 400-plus-line lane engine and
//! collision solver replaced by the pure `band` module: one stateless clamp per pane, the rule
//! CSS `position: sticky` applies. The derivation and behavioral deltas are recorded in
//! `doc/audit/file-manager-sticky-flow.md`.

/// What: the shared-constants module (application id, geometry, env var names).
/// Why: one source of truth for magic values used across the shell modules.
mod constants;
/// What: the pure sticky-band math: bands, positions, pinning, overlap counting.
/// Why: the whole layout policy, public so it unit-tests and the audit doc can cite it.
pub mod band;
/// What: the stateless GTK layout adapter over the band math.
/// Why: owns GTK plumbing only; every position decision is a pure `band` call.
mod layout;
/// What: the directory-listing and preview pane widgets.
/// Why: renders the shared model's snapshots; trimmed from the original (no thumbs, no DnD).
mod pane;
/// What: the pane-strip controller over the shared model.
/// Why: mutates spawn/dedup/close state and delegates GTK placement to `layout`.
mod strip;
/// What: keyboard navigation for the strip.
/// Why: Left/Right column focus and Backspace close, matching the Electron prototype.
mod keys;
/// What: observed-state output for boundary tests.
/// Why: mirrors the same shallow JSON schema the Electron prototype writes.
mod state_out;
/// What: the application stylesheet (black background, debug rails).
/// Why: applies a low-glare theme override and the opt-in rail tint once at startup.
mod style;
/// What: the top-level window construction module.
/// Why: keeps window assembly out of `run`.
mod window;

/// What: unit tests for the pure band math.
/// Why: compiled only under test; kept in an exempt `_tests.rs` sibling.
