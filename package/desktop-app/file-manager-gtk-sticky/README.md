# file-manager-gtk-sticky

Sticky-band variant of the GTK file manager (`package/desktop-app/file-manager`).
Same product model, reused verbatim from the original crate's public `model`/`fs`/`types`
modules, but the original's lane engine (per-lane scroll offsets, parent-chain accumulation,
rail clamping, and forward/backward collision-relaxation passes, about 400 lines across
`layout/lane.rs` and `layout/lane/geometry.rs`) is replaced by one stateless rule per pane in
`src/band.rs`:

```txt
y = band_top + clamp(scroll - band_top, 0, band_height - PANE_HEIGHT)
```

That is the rule CSS `position: sticky` applies to an element inside its containing block.
A pane's band spans from its own grid row to its deepest direct child's bottom edge (the
original's green `Y6L` rail).
Non-overlap needs no solver because the tidy tree layout makes bands within a column disjoint;
the unit tests sweep scroll offsets to hold that invariant and the boundary test asserts it live.

The derivation, and the behavioral differences against the original, are recorded in
`doc/audit/file-manager-sticky-flow.md`.

## What is deliberately out of scope

Thumbnails, drag-and-drop, and the Windows/macOS shims are the original's concern; this package
exists to compare layout engines, so its preview panes show a typed icon plus filename only.

## Interaction model

- Up/Down move the list selection inside the focused pane; Enter (or a single click) opens the
  selected entry: directories descend, files open a preview pane. Ctrl forces a duplicate pane.
- Left/Right move focus to the first pane of the adjacent column.
- Backspace (or the header close button) closes the focused pane; children of a closed pane
  become roots, per the shared model.

## Tasks

- `mise run //package/desktop-app/file-manager-gtk-sticky:build` builds the release binary.
- `mise run //package/desktop-app/file-manager-gtk-sticky:test` runs the pure band-math unit tests.
- `mise run //package/desktop-app/file-manager-gtk-sticky:test:wayland` drives the app inside `package/cli/nested-wayland-session` and asserts spawn, dedup, close, zero pane overlaps, and the root pane pinning while scrolled.
- `mise run //package/desktop-app/file-manager-gtk-sticky:lint:clippy` and `:lint:rust` run the linters.
- `mise run //package/desktop-app/file-manager-gtk-sticky:run` runs the GUI on native Wayland.

## Environment variables

- `FM_STICKY_START_DIR`: directory the first root pane lists (defaults to `$HOME`).
- `FM_STICKY_STATE_PATH`: when set, the app mirrors a shallow JSON state snapshot into this file
  after every mutation and scroll change, using the same key set as the Electron prototype
  (`activePath`, `columnCount`, `overlapCount`, `paneCount`, `ready`, `rootPinned`,
  `scrolledDown`, `scrollTopPx`), so both boundary tests share assertions.
- `FM_STICKY_DEBUG_TINT`: when set, each pane's sticky band renders as a green rail for
  screenshots, matching the original's `Y6L` overlays.
- `FM_STICKY_QUIT_MS`: self-quit after this many milliseconds, for unattended runs.
