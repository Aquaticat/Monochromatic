# file-manager-electron

Sticky-flow prototype of the Niri-like file manager.
The GTK original (`package/desktop-app/file-manager`) positions panes on fixed canvases and
re-implements scroll-following ("lanes"), clamping, and collision avoidance in a
400-plus-line layout engine.
This prototype renders the same pane model as normal-flow HTML and lets two CSS declarations
(`overflow: auto` on the strip, `position: sticky` on each pane) do all of that work.
No script runs during scrolling.

The full derivation and the behavioral differences against the original are recorded in
`doc/audit/file-manager-sticky-flow.md`.

## How the layout works

- One scroller (`.strip`, a flex row with `overflow: auto`) owns both scroll axes.
- Each column is a plain block stack of `.rail` wrapper divs.
  Wrapper heights and margins are numbers computed once per model change (`src/bands.ts`):
  a pane's rail spans from its own grid row down to its deepest direct child's bottom edge,
  the same rectangle as the GTK original's green `Y6L` lane.
- Each pane is `position: sticky; top: 0` inside its rail.
  The browser pins it to the scroller top while its rail passes, and releases it when the
  rail's end pushes it off.
- Non-overlap is structural: rails are normal-flow siblings, and the tidy tree layout
  (`src/strip.ts`, a TypeScript port of the original's `model.rs`) guarantees the flow
  margins between them are never negative.

## Interaction model

- Up/Down move the selection inside the focused pane; Enter opens it
  (directory entries descend, file entries open a preview pane).
- Click descends as well; Ctrl+click forces a duplicate pane instead of dedup-and-focus.
- Left/Right move focus to the top pane of the adjacent column.
- Backspace (or the × control) closes the focused pane; children of a closed pane become
  roots, matching the original.

## Tasks

- `mise run //package/desktop-app/file-manager-electron:build` builds the staged Electron app.
- `mise run //package/desktop-app/file-manager-electron:test:unit` runs the model, band-geometry, and sort unit tests against the built artifacts.
- `mise run //package/desktop-app/file-manager-electron:test:wayland` drives the app inside `package/cli/nested-wayland-session` and asserts spawn, dedup, close, zero pane overlaps, and the root pane pinning while scrolled.
- `mise run //package/desktop-app/file-manager-electron:test` runs both.

## Pure Wayland verification

The boundary test builds a throwaway fixture directory tree, launches the app through
`/usr/bin/env --unset=DISPLAY` inside the nested compositor, drives it purely with
compositor keyboard input, and polls the state file the main process mirrors renderer
state into (`MONOCHROMATIC_FILE_MANAGER_ELECTRON_STATE_PATH`).
The decisive assertions are `rootPinned: true` while `scrolledDown: true` (sticky is
actually sticking) and `overlapCount: 0` (flow actually prevents overlap).
A screenshot with the rail debug tint (`MONOCHROMATIC_FILE_MANAGER_ELECTRON_DEBUG_TINT`)
is captured for visual comparison against the GTK original's `Y6L` lane overlays.

## Environment variables

- `MONOCHROMATIC_FILE_MANAGER_ELECTRON_ROOT`: directory the first root pane lists
  (defaults to the home directory). Listing requests are confined under it.
- `MONOCHROMATIC_FILE_MANAGER_ELECTRON_STATE_PATH`: when set, the main process mirrors
  renderer state into this JSON file for boundary tests.
- `MONOCHROMATIC_FILE_MANAGER_ELECTRON_DEBUG_TINT`: when set, rails render with the green
  debug outline for screenshots.
