/**
 * End-user boundary test for the sticky-flow file manager under pure Wayland.
 *
 * The test builds a throwaway fixture directory tree, hosts Electron inside
 * this repo's nested Wayland compositor with `DISPLAY` unset, drives the strip
 * with compositor keyboard input, and asserts the renderer-observed state:
 * spawn, dedup, close, and, decisively, that the root pane pins to the
 * scroller top while the strip is scrolled (`rootPinned`) with zero pane
 * overlaps (`overlapCount`), the behavior CSS sticky flow must provide.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * await runFileManagerWaylandBoundaryTest();
 * ```
