# file-manager

Native cross-platform file manager.
 The interaction model is Niri-like:
 an infinite horizontal
strip of columns,
 each column stacking panes vertically.
 Horizontal position is lineage depth;
vertical position accumulates the panes spawned from the previous column.
 Single-click spawns a
child pane in the next column and focuses it (a directory spawns a listing pane;
 a file spawns a
preview pane);
 Enter or double-click opens a file with the OS default.
 Panes are deduplicated by
location and die only on explicit close.

The full product specification is `doc/planning/file-manager.md`.
 This package reclaims the
canonical,
 function-named `package/desktop-app/file-manager/` path from an earlier Slint
prototype;
 the toolkit is now GTK4 (gtk4-rs),
 chosen for native Wayland drag-and-drop on a pure
KWin session (see `doc/handover/file-manager-toolkit-exploration.md` for the decision and
`doc/handover/file-manager-gtk-build.md` for live build state).

## Why GTK4

Native OS drag-and-drop on a pure Wayland session (no XWayland) is a hard constraint.
 GTK4's GDK
implements drag-and-drop over `wl_data_device`;
 the winit-based stacks (Slint,
 and friends) do
not,
 and would need a hand-maintained protocol adapter plus a toolkit fork.
 GTK4 also renders on
the GPU,
 tears down cleanly on every platform,
 and keeps the UI in Rust with no separate markup
language.

## Status

The interactive shell is built and verified on Linux:
 a native Wayland window listing a real
directory;
 the fixed-canvas column strip that spawns a deduplicated child pane on single-click or
Enter (Ctrl forces a duplicate),
 with a per-pane close button and Left/Right column keyboard
navigation;
 off-thread image thumbnail decoding into a byte-bounded evicting cache for preview
panes;
 and file drag-and-drop (a native inbound drop target,
 native outbound drag on Wayland,
 with
Windows OLE and macOS AppKit shims for outbound elsewhere).
 See
`doc/handover/file-manager-gtk-build.md` for the build log and exactly what is verified versus
still manual.

Deferred (designed,
 not yet built):
 session-restore persistence,
 single-instance IPC,
 `fff-core`
search,
 file operations with an inverse-operation undo stack,
 native default-manager registration,
packaging,
 assistive-technology semantics,
 dragging file-list rows out,
 and dropping into a
directory as a real copy or move.

## Build and run

Run on the host with mise (Cargo builds against the system GTK 4.22 via pkg-config):

```sh
# debug build, then run on native Wayland (GDK_BACKEND=wayland, never XWayland)
mise run //package/desktop-app/file-manager:run
```

Other tasks:
 `build` (release),
 `lint` (cargo check),
 `lint:clippy` (clippy,
 warnings denied),
`lint:rust` (max-lines + require-rustdoc),
 `test` (cargo nextest).

## Platform notes

- Linux (primary):
   native Wayland window and drag-and-drop,
   no workarounds.
- Windows:
   GTK builds via gvsbuild;
   the app sets `GDK_DEBUG=dcomp` in-process so the GL renderer
  uses the GPU,
   and outbound file drag uses a native Win32 OLE shim (GDK's Win32 drag source does
  not deliver files to Explorer).
- macOS:
   inbound drops recover the path with a URI-unescape (GDK's Quartz backend percent-encodes
  the URI scheme colon),
   and outbound file drag uses a native AppKit shim.
