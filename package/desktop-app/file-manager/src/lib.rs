//! Library entry point for the Monochromatic file manager.
//!
//! The product is a Niri-like infinite horizontal strip of columns, each column stacking panes
//! vertically (see doc/planning/file-manager.md for the full interaction model, and
//! doc/handover/file-manager-gtk-build.md for build state). `run` installs non-blocking
//! logging, creates the GTK `Application`, and drives its event loop; `main.rs` is a thin bin
//! over it so the plain-Rust domain modules stay unit-testable without spinning up GTK.

/// What: the shared-constants module (application id, default geometry, env var names).
/// Why: one source of truth for magic values used across the shell modules.
mod constants;
/// What: the top-level window construction module.
/// Why: keeps window assembly out of `run`, each file under the max-lines budget.
mod window;
/// What: the directory-listing pane widget.
/// Why: renders a `DirectorySnapshot` as a virtualized icon+name list.
mod pane;
/// What: deep GTK layout adapter for the detached-column pane strip.
/// Why: centralizes horizontal scroll, static canvases, app vertical scroll, lane sticky offsets,
///      and reveal behind one interface.
mod layout;
/// What: the pane-strip controller.
/// Why: mutates the pane model and delegates GTK placement/scrolling to `layout`.
mod strip;
/// What: keyboard column navigation for the strip.
/// Why: Left/Right move focus between columns; split out to keep `strip.rs` under max-lines.
mod keys;
/// What: debug-only tint labels and overlay wrappers.
/// Why: layout screenshots need stable three-character codes naming each visible region.
mod debug_tint;
/// What: the application stylesheet (black background).
/// Why: applies a low-glare theme override once at startup.
mod style;
/// What: the off-thread thumbnail decoder and bounded texture cache.
/// Why: preview panes decode images on a worker thread and cache them with LRU eviction.
mod thumbs;
/// What: the file drag-and-drop wiring (inbound drop target, outbound drag source/shims).
/// Why: native inbound over `GdkFileList`; outbound native on Wayland, shims on Windows/macOS.
mod dnd;
/// What: the Windows-only native OLE outbound-drag shim.
/// Why: GDK's Win32 drag source cannot deliver files to Explorer.

/// What: the macOS-only native AppKit outbound-drag shim.
/// Why: GDK's Quartz drag source cannot deliver files to Finder.

/// What: the core domain types (ids, entries, locations, snapshots).
/// Why: plain-Rust model shared across the shell; public so it unit-tests without GTK.

/// What: filesystem reads producing sorted directory snapshots.
/// Why: isolates I/O so it is testable against throwaway directories.

/// What: the pane-strip state machine (spawn/dedup/focus/close).
/// Why: the Niri interaction rules live here, tested independently of GTK.
