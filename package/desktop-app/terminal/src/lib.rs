//! Library root for the Slint + libghostty-vt terminal prototype.
//!
//! The binary owns only Slint wiring. This library owns VT input, viewport row
//! mapping, resize support, and render extraction so those pieces can be tested
//! without opening a window.

/// What:     `pub mod demo;` declares the `demo` module from `src/demo.rs` and
///           makes it public to the binary.
/// Why:      Demo VT content is intentionally separate from the engine so PTY I/O
///           can replace only the feeder later.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// export * as demo from "./demo";
/// ```
pub mod demo;

/// What:     `pub mod engine;` exposes the libghostty-vt wrapper.
/// Why:      The binary and tests need to feed bytes, resize, scroll, and render.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// export * as engine from "./engine";
/// ```
pub mod engine;

/// What:     `pub mod error;` exposes the crate error type.
/// Why:      Engine methods share one typed error instead of returning raw FFI
///           errors directly.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// export * as error from "./error";
/// ```
pub mod error;

/// What:     `pub mod input;` exposes keyboard-to-terminal byte encoding.
/// Why:      The binary writes Slint key events to the PTY through this pure mapper.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// export * as input from "./input";
/// ```
pub mod input;

/// What:     `pub mod launcher;` exposes desktop-shell setup helpers.
/// Why:      The binary needs to stamp the Wayland app id before creating the
///           Slint window.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// export * as launcher from "./launcher";
/// ```
pub mod launcher;

/// What:     `pub mod pty;` exposes interactive PTY process management.
/// Why:      The binary needs shell spawning, output events, input writes, and resize.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// export * as pty from "./pty";
/// ```
pub mod pty;

/// What:     `pub mod render;` exposes renderer-neutral cell and snapshot types.
/// Why:      The engine returns these plain models, and the binary converts them
///           to Slint structs.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// export * as render from "./render";
/// ```
pub mod render;

/// What:     `pub mod scroll;` exposes pixel-to-row scroll mapping.
/// Why:      The bridge from Slint pixels to libghostty-vt rows is pure logic and
///           has unit tests.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// export * as scroll from "./scroll";
/// ```
pub mod scroll;
