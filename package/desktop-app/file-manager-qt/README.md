# file-manager-qt

Qt/cxx-qt desktop file-manager. Successor to the Slint prototype, chosen because a
real Qt/QtQuick UI provides native OS drag-and-drop on every target platform,
including native Wayland, which the winit-based toolkits (Slint, Bevy, Iced, egui)
lack. Rationale and the full cross-platform survey live in
[winit-toolkits-no-wayland-drag-and-drop.md](../../../doc/troubleshooting/winit-toolkits-no-wayland-drag-and-drop.md).

## Status

Spike in progress. Verified working: a native Wayland QML window on KWin 6.7.1,
driven by a Rust `#[cxx_qt::bridge]` QObject (a `wl_compositor` / `xdg_toplevel`
surface, no XWayland). Next milestones: a Rust `QAbstractListModel` feeding a QML
`ListView`, then inbound (Dolphin drop) and outbound native file drag-and-drop.

## Toolchain

Builds against the system Qt6 (6.11.1). On this Bazzite/Fedora atomic host the Qt6
`-devel` packages were layered live, no reboot:

```sh
sudo rpm-ostree install --apply-live --idempotent \
  qt6-qtbase-devel qt6-qtdeclarative-devel qt6-qtshadertools-devel
```

cxx-qt-build locates Qt by running `qmake`, but Fedora ships only `qmake6` (there is
no bare `qmake` for Qt6), so the mise `[env]` sets `QMAKE=/usr/bin/qmake6`. The
already-layered clang and cmake supply the C++ toolchain cxx-qt needs.

## Tasks

- `build`: release build.
- `build:debug`: debug build.
- `run`: debug build, then run the GUI on native Wayland (`QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland`).
- `lint:rust`: require-rustdoc plus max-lines (this package is a cxx-qt file, so
  require-rustdoc exempts its `use` imports and trait-impl methods).
- `lint:clippy`: clippy with warnings denied.
- `test`: `cargo nextest run`.

Run any task with `mise run //package/desktop-app/file-manager-qt:<task>`.

## Layout

- `src/main.rs`: boots `QGuiApplication` + `QQmlApplicationEngine`, loads the QML.
- `src/cxxqt_object.rs`: the `#[cxx_qt::bridge]` root QObject exposed to QML.
- `qml/main.qml`: the QtQuick UI; its module URI and version match `build.rs`.
- `build.rs`: registers the QML module and compiles the bridge (pure Cargo, no CMake).
