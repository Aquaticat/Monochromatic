# Handover: fuzzing for file-enforcer

Living document for the "add fuzzing to file-enforcer" work.
 Update it as
each target lands and as findings surface.

## Goal

Add property-based fuzzing across every parsing and transforming surface in
this package,
 to prove the parsers never crash uncaught,
 round-trip,
 and
preserve their documented invariants.
 Driven by `fast-check`.
 The explicit
ask:
 surface and fix any unexpected or undocumented behavior,
 including in
the TOML wrappers even though they bottom out in upstream
`@monochromatic-dev/module-toml-edit`.

## Decisions

- TypeScript package,
   so the Rust `cargo-fuzz` precedent does not apply;
  use `fast-check` property tests (the repo's TS precedent is
  `package/module/test/src/format-error.property.unit.test.ts`).
- One layer,
   env-parameterized (not two separate file sets).
   Each
  `*.property.unit.test.ts` inlines its arbitraries and runs through the
  normal harness with bounded `numRuns`;
   the same files become the deep
  campaign when run with a time budget.
   Shared run plan lives in
  `src/fuzz-budget.ts`.
- Seed policy:
   random (broadest coverage).
   A discovered counterexample is
  reproduced from the printed seed and pinned as a fast-check `examples`
  entry on the offending property.
- Runtime:
   node.
   node v26 runs the `.ts` test files directly (native type
  stripping) and the module-test harness runs under it;
   node exits non-zero
  on failure.
   Run tests and scripts with `node`,
   not `bun`.
- Imports:
   from sibling source `.ts` (this package's established test
  convention;
   it lets the tests reach internal helpers not in the public
  index).
   Internal helpers needed by tests are `export`ed at file level only,
  never added to `src/index.ts`.

## How to run

Bounded (normal) mode,
 one file:

```bash
node package/dev-script/file-enforcer/src/pipeline/json.property.unit.test.ts
```

Campaign mode (per-property time budget in ms):

```bash
FILE_ENFORCER_FUZZ_BUDGET_MS=60000 node package/dev-script/file-enforcer/src/pipeline/json.property.unit.test.ts
```

On failure,
 fast-check prints `{ seed, path }` and the shrunk
`Counterexample`.
 Reproduce,
 fix,
 then pin the counterexample as an
`examples` entry on that property.

## Findings (bugs the fuzzer surfaced)

### 1. json.ts: special-key (`__proto__`) assignment footgun (fixed)

`mergeFlatJson`,
 `mergeObjectDefaults`,
 and `omitJsonKey` built results with
bracket assignment (`updated[key] = value`,
 `updated[key] ??= value`).
 For
the key `__proto__`,
 that routes through the `Object.prototype` setter
instead of creating an own property,
 silently dropping the key.
 JSON parsed
from config/settings can legally carry a `__proto__` key,
 so this lost data
(and was prototype-manipulation adjacent).

Fix:
 added `setOwnJsonValue` (uses `Object.defineProperty`,
 always an own
enumerable data property) and route all dynamic-key writes through it;
read existing union members through an `Object.hasOwn` guard so inherited
members of special keys never leak in.
 Verified no prototype pollution.

### 2. json.ts: `mergeObjectDefaults` clobbered explicit null (fixed)

The TSDoc and existing unit test say it adds defaults "only where absent,
preserving existing values,
" but the `??=` implementation also overwrote an
existing `null` (nullish).
 Counterexample:
 `base {"":null}, defaults {"":""}`
yielded `""`,
 not `null`.

Fix:
 fill only when the key is genuinely absent (`!Object.hasOwn`),
 so an
explicit `null`/`false` is preserved.
 Aligns implementation with the
documented contract;
 existing unit test still passes.

## Status

Complete.
 All seven targets have green property tests;
 the campaign task,
decision doc,
 and full verification are done.

- fast-check devDependency added (`catalog:`),
   resolves for the package.
- `src/fuzz-budget.ts` shared run plan (bounded vs campaign via
  `FILE_ENFORCER_FUZZ_BUDGET_MS`).
- Property tests,
   all green under node:
   JSON (`pipeline/json.ts`),
   glob
  (`io/glob-split.ts`,
   `io/glob-mirror.ts`),
   registry
  (`package/registry-parse.ts`),
   XML coding (`pipeline/xml-coding.ts`),
   TOML
  (`pipeline/toml.ts`),
   XML entries (`pipeline/xml.ts`),
   JetBrains versions
  (`jetbrains/options-dir.ts`).
- `src/jetbrains/options-dir.ts`:
   `parseVersionParts`,
   `compareVersionParts`,
  and the `NOT_A_MATCHING_PRODUCT` sentinel exported at file level (not in
  index) for the version property test.
- `fuzz` mise task (node,
   env-budgeted) added;
   smoke-run at 500ms per
  property is green.
- Decision doc `doc/decision/file-enforcer-fuzzing.md` written (no
  `AGENTS.md` pointer,
   per user).

Verification done:

- `lint:oxlint` 0 warnings 0 errors;
   `lint:types` clean.
- All seven `*.property.unit.test.ts` pass under node;
   all existing
  `*.unit.test.ts` still pass under node (no regression from the `json.ts`
  fix).
- Falsifiability:
   deliberately dropping `&` escaping in `escapeXmlAttribute`
  made the round-trip property FAIL with counterexample `["&\n"]` and exit
  non-zero;
   reverted.
- Only the JSON pipeline surfaced defects (findings 1 and 2);
   the other six
  targets found none.

## How to run the campaign

```bash
mise run //package/dev-script/file-enforcer:fuzz --budget 60000
```

Default budget is 60000ms per property.
 Bounded mode (the normal suite) runs
each property file directly,
 for example
`node package/dev-script/file-enforcer/src/pipeline/json.property.unit.test.ts`.
