/**
 * Path used by file-enforcer's property-extraction and key-edit helpers.
 *
 * Array of segments: string segments index into object keys; numeric segments
 * index into array elements. Mixed forms compose for nested array-of-tables
 * access such as `['fruits', 0, 'name',]`.
 *
 * Coincides structurally with {@link TomlPath} from `\@monochromatic-dev/module-toml-edit`
 * so values flow without conversion. Defined locally so callers do not have to
 * import a TOML-named type for JSON helpers.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const path: Path = ['settings', 'theme',];
 * const arrayPath: Path = ['fruits', 0, 'name',];
 * ```
