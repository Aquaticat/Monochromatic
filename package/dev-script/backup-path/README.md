# @monochromatic-dev/dev-script-backup-path

Copies a file or directory into `./bak/<timestamp>/`,
 preserving file
timestamps.
 Useful before destructive edits to a path you do not want
to lose.

## What it does

1. Takes one positional argument:
    the path to back up.
2. Logs `Backing up <path>` to stdout.
3. Computes a timestamp from `new Date().toISOString()` with colons stripped
   (e.g. `2026-05-14T061711.030Z`).
4. Creates `./bak/<timestamp>/` relative to the current working directory.
5. Recursively copies the source into `./bak/<timestamp>/<basename>`,
   preserving file mtimes and atimes and erroring if the destination
   already exists.

## Usage

Run directly against the source:

```sh
node package/dev-script/backup-path/src/index.ts ./some/file-or-dir
```

Or against the built output once the package is installed as a
workspace dependency:

```sh
node node_modules/@monochromatic-dev/dev-script-backup-path/dist/final/node/index.js ./some/file-or-dir
```

There is no `mise run` task wrapper;
 invoke `node` directly.

## Arguments

- positional `<path>`:
   file or directory to back up.
   Required.
- `--help`:
   print usage and exit.

No environment variables are read.

## Quirks

- `./bak/` is **not** auto-created.
   The internal `mkdir('bak/<timestamp>')`
  call runs without `recursive: true`,
   so a missing `./bak/` parent
  fails with `ENOENT: no such file or directory, mkdir 'bak/...'`.
  Run `mkdir bak` once in the working directory on first use.
- Destination existence is rejected via `errorOnExist: true`.
   The
  millisecond-resolution timestamp prevents this from firing under
  normal serial use;
   back-to-back invocations within the same
  millisecond would collide.
- The copy uses Node's `fs.cp` with `preserveTimestamps: true`.
   File
  permissions and ownership follow the platform default of that API
  and are not explicitly preserved.
