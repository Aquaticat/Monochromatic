/**
 * Iterate `oxlint --fix` until the codebase reaches a fixpoint.
 *
 * oxlint applies at most one fix per overlapping byte region per pass and does
 * not re-lint within a single invocation, so two rules whose fixes touch
 * overlapping spans (or a fix that introduces a fresh fixable violation) need
 * multiple `--fix` runs to fully converge. ESLint loops up to ten times for the
 * same reason; oxlint tracks the gap at oxc#16118 but has not shipped
 * fix-iteration. Full analysis:
 * {@link file://../../../../doc/troubleshooting/oxlint-multi-fix-convergence.md}.
 *
 * Detecting convergence is the hard part. `oxlint --fix` reports neither through
 * its exit code nor its stdout whether a pass actually changed any file: a pass
 * that applies fixes and leaves nothing unfixable exits zero with
 * `Found 0 ... errors.`, identical to a genuine no-op pass, even when its fixes
 * introduced a fresh fixable violation that the next pass will rewrite. oxlint's
 * JSON output carries no fix-applied count either. The only signal that tracks
 * the file is a plain (no-fix) lint of the post-fix state: it reports every
 * remaining violation, fixable or not, so its output moves while the file moves
 * and settles exactly when the file stops changing.
 *
 * {@link fixUntilStable} therefore runs two oxlint invocations per pass: one
 * `--fix` to apply fixes, then one plain lint as the convergence oracle. That
 * doubles oxlint work versus a single pass, which is the cost of correctness
 * given oxlint exposes no fix-applied signal; the documented baseline already
 * accepts running `--fix` twice. Both runners are injected so the loop is
 * unit-testable without spawning oxlint.
