/**
 * Builds a {@link WatchFilter} that gates events by include and exclude
 * regex patterns against `event.relativePath`.
 *
 * Why a sibling to {@link globFilter} rather than a flag on it: regex and
 * glob have different semantics (anchored vs. shell-glob; character class
 * vs. brace alternation), and a watchexec consumer expressing intent in
 * regex form should not have to translate it into picomatch idioms just
 * to reach the same chokidar event. Both filters run in series; either
 * side rejecting an event is enough to skip it.
 *
 * Semantics, evaluated in this order on each event:
 *
 * 1. If any `exclude` pattern matches `event.relativePath`, return `false`.
 *    Exclude beats include; an exclude match short-circuits the decision.
 * 2. If no `include` patterns were configured, return `true` (no positive
 *    constraint to satisfy).
 * 3. Return `true` iff at least one `include` pattern matches.
 *
 * Both lists default to empty; an entirely default call (`regexFilter({})`)
 * passes every event, matching {@link globFilter}'s vacuous-pass-all
 * convention so the orchestrator can hand raw flag arrays through without
 * branching on emptiness when both lists happen to be empty.
 *
 * Patterns are matched against {@link WatchEvent.relativePath} (relative
 * to the deepest matching watch root), not the absolute path; this keeps
 * patterns workspace-portable and consistent with {@link globFilter}.
 *
 * @returns watch filter combining include / exclude regex lists
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const filter = regexFilter({
 *   include: [/\.story\.ts$/,],
 *   exclude: [/\.test\.ts$/,],
 * },);
 * filter({ event: { relativePath: 'foo.story.ts', ... }, ctx, },); // true
 * filter({ event: { relativePath: 'foo.test.ts', ... }, ctx, },);  // false
 * ```
