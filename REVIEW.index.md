- Package management (pnpm with catalog mode)
- Runtime environments (Bun, Node.js)
- Build system (TypeScript, Vite/Rolldown)
- Formatting and linting pipeline
- Testing infrastructure
- CI/CD tooling

**Key Findings**:
- Modern, cutting-edge tool selection
- Excellent configuration quality
- Comprehensive multi-tool formatting/linting pipeline
- Strong automation and task orchestration
- High complexity and learning curve
- "latest" versions pose stability risks
- Fresh clone setup issues documented

**Top Recommendations**:
1. Pin tool versions for stability
2. Improve onboarding documentation
3. Add build CI/CD workflows
4. Simplify configuration where possible

### 4. [Package Analysis](REVIEW.packages.md) (693 lines)

**Rating**: 7/10

Reviews all 15 packages across 6 categories, analyzing completeness, quality, and organization.

**Key Topics**:
- Core module library (module-es)
- Configuration packages
- Build utilities
- Style framework
- Site packages
- Figma plugin
- Package dependencies and exports

**Key Findings**:
- Well-organized monorepo structure (15 packages)
- Core module library: 791 TypeScript files, but only 40% complete
- Missing implementations: object, date, math utilities
- Excellent configuration packages
- Very low test coverage outside core module (0% for most packages)
- Documentation concentrated in core module

**Top Recommendations**:
1. Complete core module utilities (object, date, math)
2. Increase test coverage across all packages
3. Document all packages comprehensively
4. Optimize bundle size and tree-shaking

### 5. [Recommendations and Action Plan](REVIEW.recommendations.md) (620 lines)

**Rating**: N/A (Action Plan)

Consolidates findings and provides a prioritized roadmap with timeline and resource estimates.

**Key Topics**:
- Critical issues requiring immediate action
- High-priority improvements (next quarter)
- Medium-priority enhancements (next 6 months)
- Low-priority future work
- Implementation roadmap (12-month timeline)
- Resource requirements
- Success criteria
- Risk mitigation

**Priority Actions**:
1. **Critical**: Low test coverage (13% → 80%, 2-3 months)
2. **Critical**: Incomplete core module (40% → 80%, 3-6 months)
3. **Critical**: Technical debt accumulation (1-2 months)
4. **Critical**: Build system stability (2-3 weeks)
5. **High**: Documentation consolidation (3-4 weeks)

**Timeline**: 6-12 months to production quality (version 1.0)
