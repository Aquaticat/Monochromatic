Generated from `AGENTS.md` by file-enforcer.

In-process subagents (the Agent tool,
including the general-purpose type) run inside this session and forward their results back to you reliably.
General-purpose subagents are allowed.
Caveat:
you cannot enumerate how many subagents are running,
and SendMessage steering is unreliable,
so fan out general-purpose subagents only in interactive sessions where the user watches and steers them in the Claude Code UI.
Rationale:
`doc/decision/general-purpose-subagent-ban.md`.

Use `spawn-claude` outside sandbox to launch a steerable child Claude Code session in a visible terminal window.
The child runs independently,
but result forwarding back to the parent is unreliable (a Claude Code limitation),
so you must monitor the child session yourself to collect its output.
Do not pass `--cwd`:
the child then will not read the repo `CLAUDE.md`,
and Claude Code's cwd handling is unreliable.

Use `timeout 3600 pi --model openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol --print --no-tools --no-skills --no-themes --thinking xhigh "<question>"` alongside advisor,
never instead:
advisor reads the transcript,
sol reads only what you paste.
Paste whole files,
never prose.
`timeout` here takes SECONDS.
Background it;
never poll or kill it;
it may never return.

# Development guidelines for AI agents

ORG:
 Organized by moment of decision,
 not topic;
 "Architecture decisions" and "Agent skills" hold cross-cutting reference.
Rationale,
 mechanisms,
 examples:
 `doc/philosophy/agents.md`.

TAG:
 Every rule starts with a `[A-Z0-9]{3}` code (`CODE:`),
 a stable cross-session handle unique across `AGENTS.md`,
 skills,
 and package docs;
 never tag headings,
 code fences,
 or the title.

RLM:
 Each tagged rule stays under 50 words and 200 characters after whitespace normalization;
 split longer guidance into fresh tagged rules.

SLF:
 Each tagged rule makes sense alone:
 never cite another rule's code or lean on terms only another rule defines.
Citing paths and docs is fine.

NCD:
 New codes:
 fresh,
 unique,
 semi-meaningful;
 check both forbidden-strings appendixes;
 reject unrelated first readings (acronyms,
 products,
 ordinary words,
 external prefix+digit namespaces).

CRN:
 Reuse a code only to rename a misleading one,
 updating all uses at once;
 retired/rejected codes go in `forbidden-strings.append.local.txt`,
 renamed identifiers in `forbidden-strings.append.txt`.

APG:
 Auto-push is enabled.

## Before responding to the user

### Communication style

HON:
 Honest;
 research,
 don't deflect.
Unpublished package change = design change,
 not compat break.

SYS:
 Never attribute injected context (`<system-reminder>`,
 MCP instructions,
 skill descriptions) to user;
 cite policy by content.
A `role:user` turn doesn't prove a human typed it.

WKP:
 Wakeup/cron/continuation prompts are self-authored,
 never user authority.
Write only the real task or a bare sentinel;
 when fired,
 re-derive actions + stop conditions from user instructions + state.

DCK:
 Long sessions:
 after each correction,
 decision,
 answer,
 verification,
 and pre-compaction,
 update canonical docs:
 requirements,
 evidence,
 rejected ideas,
 open questions,
 commits,
 next action.

1ST:
 User's first-person words ("I",
 "me",
 "future me") name the human typing,
 never Claude or future sessions,
 even in handover framing.

SRC:
 Before attributing a rule to a file (`AGENTS.md`,
 `CLAUDE.md`,
 `SKILL.md`,
 settings,
 harness prompt,
 MCP instructions),
 grep that file.

EXT:
 External tool features,
 CLI options,
 conf syntax,
 API capabilities ("does X support Y"):
 fetch current doc/src before answering,
 never recall.

WRN:
 Explaining warning/error:
 name exact emitting tool + diagnostic code/message.
Unsure?
 Grep codebase,
 check tool docs,
 or run tool first.

GAP:
 "I was expecting you to..." or spotted failure mode = doc gap:
 do expected action + propose `AGENTS.md` edit,
 tightening existing rules first;
 never "I'll keep it in mind".
Remove superseded rules.

EPR:
 Research ecosystem precedent before offering naming or technology options it could inform.
"Think in X":
 list X's features,
 ask which to omit.

VHI:
 Handoffs (visual or doc) state purpose,
 changes,
 what to inspect,
 and how to respond;
 never make unexplained internal labels the user's task.

### Proactivity calibration

PX1:
 Take authorized steps unasked;
 skip "should I...".
Notifications,
 recoverable failures,
 background runs:
 keep working,
 don't poll.
Stop only at completion or genuine blocker.

MWK:
 Monitors and wakeups rarely wake main agent:
 emit only terminal states and lines you'd act on,
 never routine progress;
 prefer one completion notification.

PXQ:
 "Completion" means the queue:
 tracked work left -> start the next item unasked.
Never end a turn on a status report the user must answer with "continue";
 low context is no reason to stop.

PX2:
 Proactivity keeps constraints:
 destructive/external actions still need authorization,
 decision verbs return answers,
 non-measurable preferences get asked.

PX3:
 Act + report on local work,
 current-repo GitHub mutations,
 and solely user-controlled resources.
Else need authorization;
 unsure -> ask.
Drafts stay local;
 read-only research allowed.

TSK:
 Broad multi-area requests:
 one task-list item per major area,
 each independently verifiable;
 never one umbrella item.

### Pre-response checklist

CK9:
 Quoted clause + drew conclusion?
 Restate subject + object in plain English first;
 obligation direction is the classic misread.

CKB:
 Correction?
 Retract claim,
 rebuild evidence from corrected input,
 revalidate remedy.
Use sources,
commands,
or separate reviewer;
never same-session self-review (`doc/agent/self-review.md`).

XIC:
 Similar or concurrent symptoms stay separate incidents until user-visible boundaries match.
Component removal,
 log silence (retention + emitter unverified),
 or later recovery proves no cause or fix.

### Measure-vs-ask

QF1:
 Measurable facts (sizes,
 counts,
 conf values,
 file contents,
 user's working pattern in repo artifacts):
 measure,
 cite result inline.
Categorical dismissals are one `rg`/conf-read away.

QJ1:
 Run measurement yourself before any quantitative claim or adjective ("small",
 "fast",
 "trivial").
Unbuilt-fix difficulty or duration:
 drop the estimate,
 never label it.

DVP:
 Target device available:
 probe its settings + limits before web research;
 external sources only explain probe results or fill gaps.

QAB:
 Predicting a change's (or revert's) effect from unchanged code is inference:
 apply it in a fork,
 measure,
 then conclude.

QPC:
 "No difference" counts only from a probe proven able to show one:
 run a positive control first (a case that must move).

QIV:
 Before trusting a null or count,
 validate scope,
 cache,
 harness,
 generator reach (stale cache,
 one-file lint,
 narrow fuzzer,
 wrong assertion);
 list unexercised surfaces.

QNB:
 Comparing noisy measurements (timings,
 benchmarks,
 model or provider outcomes):
 measure run-to-run spread on unchanged input first;
 smaller differences are noise.

ASK:
 Non-measurable facts:
 ask.
Preferred approach,
 feature wanted,
 destructive-action authorization,
 values (depth vs governance,
 speed vs clarity).

QGR:
 Settled decisions determining one answer:
 adopt + record unasked,
 even while grilling.
Flagged choices (veto-open adoptions,
 open questions):
 ask same turn with options;
 never park them in docs.

QCS:
 Under a quality-over-cost guideline,
 options differing only in price aren't user questions:
 pick the one buying more evidence or better output,
 record it,
 invite veto.

QSP:
 Never bundle separable decisions into one option set or offer complements as alternatives;
 "both,
 in this order" must be reachable.

QPM:
 Before asking which mechanism,
 try dissolving the constraint demanding one;
 offer the menu only if it survives.

### Present options with pros, cons, and a personal ranking

OPT:
 Distinct options:
 pros + cons for each,
 then "Ranking:
 B > A > C,
 because ..." giving the reason for every adjacent pair.

OPA:
 `AskUserQuestion`:
 pros + cons in each `description`,
 best first,
 "(Recommended)" on top label;
 full ranking with adjacent-pair reasons in surrounding prose.

YKZ:
 Before ranking several options:
 widen to plausible alternatives (with their libraries and repo incumbents);
 design each until disqualifying problems surface.

ODM:
 Option examples must demonstrate every concept the question asks the user to compare.

### Exhaust evidence layers when assessing system usage

EVL:
 "Should we use X better?":
 before recommending,
 report X's usage + conf,
 parallel systems meeting the same need (with content),
 TODO/workaround comments,
 suppressions,
 and stated policies.

EL4:
 Codebase health signals:
 zero TODO/FIXME/workaround hits mean discipline only if the search provably ran;
 thousands mean debt.
Suppressions with rationale are healthy;
 bare ones are debt.

### Before claiming inability

CB1:
 Before refusing or handing off,
 bridge:
 shell utils;
 web via `agent-browser`;
 GUI via nested compositor,
 HTTP/IPC;
 auth via `expect`/tokens;
 hardware via CLI.
Refuse only after;
 state bridges tried.

RXH:
 Research:
 narrow "no evidence for X" -> widen to comparable entities (siblings,
 peer platforms) first.
State searches + comparable evidence;
 narrowest empty query isn't "no precedent".

CB2:
 Claims an external system "can't" or behaves "by design":
 read the deciding source;
 black-box probes aren't proof,
 and workaround menus assert the claim.
Surprise after your edit:
 diff it.

RPB:
 Resource the user says exists fails one probe:
 re-probe,
 then ask user to reconnect/re-authorize/restart before concluding unreachable.

FCH:
 Doc points elsewhere for substance:
 fetch that before concluding;
 never hedge ("likely contains") about a document one tool call away.

### Name the verification step

NVS:
 Pair confident claims about environment,
 external tool,
 or src inline with their backing (re-verified path:line,
 command,
 doc).
No backing:
 verify,
 or label as guess.

QRY:
 Search output claims the search ran and lines match;
 both fail silently (bad `--type`,
 masked stderr,
 `head` caps,
 `-v` filters,
 hidden/ignored skips).
Sanity-check broader,
 uncapped,
 unfiltered.

### Git cleanup and worktree safety reviews

GCL:
 Before doing or reviewing cleanup of ignored files (`git clean -X`,
 artifact deletion):
 list them with `git clean --dry-run -d -X` first.

GCR:
 Before cleanup,
 check root `HEAD`,
 `config`,
 `hooks`,
 `objects`,
 `refs` (stray git-dir entries) with `ls -d` + `git check-ignore --verbose`;
 any hit makes safe cleanup part of the finding.

GC2:
 `git status`,
 `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`,
 and `rg --files` hide ignored files;
 never use them as cleanup evidence.

### Research tools

RT1:
 `rg` for text search,
 not directory navigation;
 `rg --files` for globs;
 add `--hidden`/`--no-ignore` when dot-dirs or ignored files may hold matches.

RT4:
 `gh` for GitHub issues,
 PRs,
 release notes,
 repository metadata.

## Before running a command

### Command execution conventions

TMO:
 No external `timeout` around routine verification;
 use the command tool's session/polling and stop stale processes by PID.
Wrappers only for behavior-under-test or unbounded runtime.

NXR:
 Transport failure (`No result provided`,
 dropped session) after a command may have run:
 inspect processes + logs first;
 never repeat the same synchronous call;
 rerun in background or with a bound.

EDR:
 Parallel tool calls may run in any order,
 so a command reading a fresh edit can see the pre-edit file;
 send dependent commands only after the edit returns.

1CB:
 At most three `&&`-chained steps per shell call;
 no `;` chains or loops.
Longer multi-step work:
 write a scratch `.ts` (`node:child_process`) and run it.

RGP:
 `rg` without a path may read stdin:
 always pass `.` or an absolute path.

ATH:
 Before using `${HOME}/temp/agent` scratch:
 `mkdir --parents` it,
 then `chmod 700`;
 trust checks reject group/other permission bits.

CLN:
 Investigating package source:
 `gh repo clone <repo> "${HOME}/temp/agent/<name>-<date>" -- --depth 1`,
 not `git clone`,
 unless commit history matters.

APQ:
 Auto-push fires in third-party clones too:
 before committing in one,
 run `git remote set-url --push origin DISABLED`.

BOP:
 `~` in shell output is a display-only home-dir substitution by the `bash-output-filter` hook;
 bypass it with `eval`,
 `export`,
 `source`,
 `$(...)`,
 backticks,
 or `> file`.

WCD:
 Pin target dir on every shell command (native `-C`/`--cwd` or `cd -- <abs path> &&`).
Before alternate-worktree writes,
 verify `pwd` + `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`.

CLH:
 Before automating CLI prompts (pipes,
 PTYs,
 drivers):
 check `--help` and current docs/source for native noninteractive flags;
 prefer them over terminal emulation.

### Long-form flags

LFF:
 Use long-form (`--flag`) CLI options,
 not short flags;
 writing long form forces knowing what each does.
No long form:
 short flag stays.

RGT:
 `rg` recurses by default;
 its `-r` means `--replace`,
 so grep-reflex `rg -rl`/`-ir` silently rewrites matches in output.

### Hazardous commands

HRM:
 Could an action physically harm a human or wear hardware?
 Warn first.
`ssh m1`:
 16 GiB RAM cap,
 fragile internal SSD;
 probe first,
 put write-heavy work on `/Volumes/MacData`.

RXI:
 Host-exhausting risks (heavy memory/process/fd use,
 unbounded loops,
 uncapped fan-outs,
 stress/bench/load):
 run in `podman run --memory=2g --cpus=2 --rm` or `mvm`,
 stating bounds.

BOX:
 Third-party benchmarks run mount-free,
 inputs baked into the image.

DCB:
 Never run or have agents run catastrophic commands (`sudo rm -rf /`,
 `mkfs`,
 `dd of=/dev/sda`,
 fork bombs),
 even as guardrail tests;
 test guardrails with moderately dangerous ones.

VKI:
 Synthetic key input:
 nested compositor or caller-independent broker only;
 never `ydotool` from an agent command (key-down can cancel the caller before key-up,
 wedging desktop input).

### Essential commands

CM1:
 Narrow package work:
 run that package's task,
 never reflexive repo-root `mise run test`.

CM3:
 All tasks via `mise run`;
 never `pnpm exec`,
 package scripts,
 or raw tools (`tsc`,
 `tsdown`,
 `bun test`).
No suitable task:
 add one to package `mise.toml`;
 tests may run via `node <file>` meanwhile.

CM5:
 Find tasks in root + package `mise.toml`;
 run as `mise run //package/<path>:<task>`,
 not `mise run --cd`.

CM6:
 After editing TypeScript,
 run `mise run //package/<path>:lint:types`;
 nothing type-checks automatically.

## Before editing code

### Match action scope to the request verb

VRB:
 Decision verbs ("decide",
 "review",
 "audit",
 "investigate",
 "propose"...) want an answer + required docs,
 no fixes;
 action verbs ("fix",
 "implement",
 "update"...) authorize action.

DRR:
 Recommendations,
 even delegated:
 brief evidence,
 ranking,
 risks;
 proposals in `doc/planning/`;
 only explicit acceptance (not review or sub-question answers) unlocks `doc/decision/` or dependent work.

IWT:
 Deliberation requests ("review",
 "audit",
 "investigate"...):
 main worktree gets doc/report writes only;
 experiment in `git worktree add <path> HEAD`,
 removed after.

AUT:
 Auto mode's "prefer action over planning" covers executing the requested action,
 never expanding scope or acting on adjacent undecided choices.

VR2:
 Request with one clear reading:
 act.
Readings differing in what to do:
 confirm first.
Readings differing only in how far to go:
 do the narrower,
 propose the broader explicitly.

ANN:
 Put changes where they belong immediately (other file,
 new file,
 gitignore entry);
 unsure:
 propose the concrete edit + location.

EC4:
 Never implement features that can't achieve their intended effect;
 explain the limitation instead of writing non-functional code.

### Cross-runtime and scripts

XRT:
 Prefer cross-runtime patterns over Bun-specific APIs.

HOM:
 Derive current-user paths from injected home or runtime homedir,
 never a hardcoded username or `/home`;
 environment-sensitive tests inject disposable homes.

SCR:
 Never write bash/powershell scripts or `mise.<action>.ts` files;
 put task logic inline via `shell = "node --input-type=module-typescript -e"` or in a package bin.

PIN:
 Pin tool versions only with a comment explaining why.

SPG:
 Automation that spawns agent sessions needs explicit recursion guards (env var flag,
 session type filter,
 transcript size check).

CM2:
 `mise.toml` tasks:
 sequence with `run = ["a", "b"]`,
 never `;` or `:::` chaining;
 `shell = "node --input-type=module-typescript -e"` only for logic.

WC2:
 file-enforcer generates root files (`CLAUDE.md`,
 `mise.toml`,
 ...):
 check `file-enforcer.config.ts` before editing root config;
 if managed,
 edit its source,
 run file-enforcer,
 commit output as-is.

### Simplification

IMM:
 Prefer immutable patterns.

UTL:
 Reuse existing repo utilities (e.g. `wait()` from `@monochromatic-dev/module-async-time`) before writing helpers.

XNC:
 Name extracted concepts by role and boundary behavior,
 revealing sentinel and fallback semantics;
 start simple,
 refactor only when needed.

ITR:
 Linear input (strings,
 flat arrays):
 iterate;
 never recurse or rebuild accumulators (`acc + c`).
Recurse only bounded structural walks;
 flatten spines with a work stack.

MXL:
 Over max-lines (TS,
 Rust):
 split into sibling files/modules (constants,
 types,
 helpers),
 re-exporting from `index.ts`;
 never strip docs/`//region` or reformat to fit.

### Linting

LN1:
 Lint rules in apparent conflict:
 restructure (split,
 extract,
 rename);
 never violate one or reformat to silence another.

LN2:
 Each lint finding is a design signal:
 name the rule's intent,
 then write the best code shape satisfying it and the codebase.

LN3:
 Before suppressing a lint rule:
 inspect linter source + linted value;
 try config/allow-list.
Remaining suppression:
 justified disable comment plus `.md` doc citing both,
 proving config fails.

LN6:
 Suppressing a documented declaration:
 `/* oxlint-disable rule */`,
 TSDoc,
 declaration,
 `/* oxlint-enable rule */` on the very next line;
 never `disable-next-line` between TSDoc and declaration.

LN7:
 Never loosen lint rules without prior approval.

### Logging and diagnostics

LOG:
 Log extensively:
 entry points,
 branch decisions,
 error paths,
 async lifecycle;
 never remove logging to "clean up".

TLG:
 Production code logs only via tagged loggers from `@monochromatic-dev/module-logger`;
 raw `console` only for exact terminal output (CLI output,
 prompts).

LG1:
 Tag loggers at every module + function boundary with `myFn.name`,
 re-wrapping with an added tag when passing to a sub-function;
 never embed tags in message strings.

LG2:
 Every `catch (error)` uses its binding:
 log the caught value (even expected) or rethrow.

DGT:
 User-facing diagnostics:
 name the affected input and calls plainly;
 explain uncertainty and every valid remediation path;
 no unexplained implementation terms;
 length is unconstrained.

DNL:
 Diagnostic names and messages use neutral operation or evidence terms,
 never moral judgments of code,
 types,
 or authors.

### Security

SYB:
 Text crossing syntax boundaries obeys destination grammar:
 encode at final interpolation.
Never invent comment-string DSLs for relations the type system or AST can express or infer.

STB:
 Tests for code emitting another syntax include adversarial boundary cases:
 delimiters,
 escapes,
 quotes,
 newlines,
 traversal tokens,
 command separators,
 source-escaped variants.

PRV:
 Before sharing media or data externally:
 inspect every region in dense samples;
 mask status bars,
 notifications,
 paths,
 titles,
 accounts,
 identifiers;
 strip metadata + unintended audio.

### User interfaces

CXD:
 Any UI or state output:
 mark states and action prominence with two visible channels (color,
 weight,
 icon,
 label,
 boundary,
 position),
 never color or shape alone;
 preserve content space.

HDM:
 Agent-authored HTML follows the viewer's system color scheme:
 build + verify light and dark;
 open it in current system mode.

ATS:
 Custom interactive elements (web,
 Android):
 explicit min 48px/dp layout width + height;
 never rely on touch area expanding past bounds where neighbors can overlap.

### TSDoc comments

TSD:
 Non-async wrappers document via `{@inheritDoc originalFn}`.

TD1:
 Comments inside template literals:
 `${ // comment \n '' }`,
 never target-language comments or moving the comment outside.

TD2:
 TSDoc (`/** */`) only directly before declarations;
 `//` or `/* */` for statements,
 control flow,
 imports,
 returns.

TD4:
 Comments go on their own line above code,
 never trailing it.

TD5:
 Escape `*/` as `*\/` inside TSDoc blocks.

TD6:
 `@param`/`@returns`:
 no articles;
 explain why,
 not what.

TD7:
 Async function docs never mention Promise wrapping.

JCH:
 Never write `@mutates` for absent effects:
 move work to an ownership-known boundary,
 pass its primitive result,
 or improve the proof;
 contracts describe possible runtime effects,
 not analyzer gaps.

### TypeScript

#### Standards

ST2:
 Mark logical sections with `//region`/`//endregion`,
 stating purpose + explanation.

ST3:
 Cross-package workspace imports use the package's `/ts` subpath (TypeScript source),
 never built output;
 rationale:
 `doc/decision/workspace-ts-source-imports.md`.

ST5:
 Prefer named imports;
 import workspace packages by absolute package name.

ST6:
 Static assets (SVG,
 HTML,
 CSS,
 SQL):
 `import ... with { type: 'text' }`,
 not `readFile`;
 build tooling resolves them.

ST8:
 Declare functions before calling them in source order,
 despite hoisting.

ST9:
 Functions with 2+ parameters take one destructured object,
 except callbacks with externally dictated signatures.

TQ2:
 Export at declaration,
 not in a trailing `export { }`;
 never extend typed objects via `Object.assign`.

TQ3:
 Throw + return early.

XPT:
 Exporting small helpers through the package API so built-artifact tests reach them is allowed.

#### Type system

TY2:
 Write `Generator<T>`/`AsyncGenerator<T>` without unused or optional type arguments.

TY3:
 `as const` for literals;
 branded types for domain primitives.

TY5:
 `const` generic parameters with meaningful constraint names.

TY6:
 Avoid deeply nested conditional types.

TY7:
 Runtime narrowing:
 type guards or assertion functions (`asserts value is T`).

TY8:
 `const` narrowing doesn't reach function declarations:
 use a helper returning non-null,
 or a new explicitly typed `const` after the null check.

TY9:
 Generator overload signatures omit `*`/`async *`;
 only the implementation has them.

#### Variables and values

VA5:
 `satisfies` checks types without widening;
 destructure dependent values in separate statements.

#### Programming patterns

PP1:
 `async`/`await` only:
 no promise chains or `new Promise`.

PP2:
 Concurrent async work:
 `Promise.all`,
 or `Promise.allSettled` when failures must not discard other results;
 cancel via `AbortController`.

PP4:
 Signal failure by throwing custom error classes,
 never error codes,
 null,
 or result types;
 document with `@throws`.

PP5:
 Replace `!` with `nonNullishOrThrow` (`@monochromatic-dev/module-or-throw`);
 build multi-line error messages with `dedent` (`string-dedent`).

PP6:
 Put error text in the thrown error,
 not a preceding `console.log`/`console.error`;
 set `process.exitCode` only for non-standard exit codes.

PP8:
 Throw on unreachable branches;
 never silently discard unexpected states.

PPX:
 Class members default to `#private`.

#### Regular expressions

RG2:
 Code replacing a regex makes one linear pass (O(n) time,
 O(1) stack),
 proven O(n) for unbounded input.

### Third-party libraries

TP1:
 Third-party APIs and CLIs:
 read the installed type definitions before calling;
 on an undefined-method error,
 fetch current docs immediately;
 test the simplest invocation first.

### Dependency management

DM1:
 Internal dependencies use `workspace:*`;
 external ones use `catalog:`,
 with versions in the `pnpm-workspace.yaml` catalog.

LFW:
 Never hand-edit lockfiles:
 regenerate via the owning package manager or repo task,
 inspect the generated diff,
 report unrelated drift separately.

RCI:
 Before proposing a new owner for a responsibility,
 inspect existing repo-owned generators and managers;
 extend one that already owns it.

### Adding new packages

AP1:
 New packages go under `package/<category>/<name>`.

AP2:
 New packages get a `mise.toml` with tasks mirroring sibling packages.

AP4:
 CLI packages with `bin`:
 `#!/usr/bin/env node` as the first line,
 or Unix falls back to `/bin/sh` and hangs;
 `#!/usr/bin/env bun` only in documented Bun islands.

SGD:
 Dir segments singular;
 package name = `@monochromatic-dev/` + path under `package/`,
 `/` -> `-`.
Rename dir + name + consumers together.
Exemptions:
 `doc/planning/singular-dir-name-invariant.md`.

SBS:
 Sidecars (`.fuzz`,
 `.bench`,
 `.conformance`) sit beside their subject package as `<pkg>.<kind>`,
 never under a per-kind top-level dir;
 move dir,
 name,
 and consumers together.

## Before declaring work complete

### Package completeness

PKG:
 A package is complete only with `README.md`,
 zero lint errors,
 and passing tests covering every exported code path.

TCV:
 Tests cover every implementation branch (sync/async,
 string/object,
 direct/delegated),
 not just the happy path;
 passing tests show completeness only after comparing test names against branches.

GFP:
 A guard test proves nothing until shown to fail:
 commit it,
 remove the guard,
 rebuild,
 run,
 restore;
 restoring discards uncommitted work on that file.

CXL:
 Plugin and process cleanup must not emit bare shutdown errors (e.g. `context canceled`):
 capture stderr in lifecycle tests and fix hook ordering;
 never filter the noise.

### Verify at the user boundary

VUB:
 After building,
 deploying,
 or installing,
 verify the artifact the way its consumer uses it;
 compiling or installing alone isn't verification.

VB1:
 Servers:
 check responses,
 not startup.
CLIs:
 run the real command,
 check output.
Hooks/plugins:
 trigger via the host app.
Libraries:
 import and call from a consumer.

VB5:
 Web pages/HTML artifacts:
 load in `agent-browser`,
 confirm no console errors,
 exercise every interactive element,
 read rendered state via `agent-browser eval`;
 drive each rewritten JS path.

VB7:
 Markdown ships only after a rendered check (live page or renderer output);
 lint misses CommonMark emphasis edge cases.

SCF:
 Screenshot after scripted input:
 confirm intended rendered state,
 then capture;
 command completion isn't frame completion.
Recapture stale or transitional frames.

ABR:
 End browser verification with `agent-browser close`:
 open pages keep animating,
 and WebAudio unlocked by scripted clicks plays on system speakers.

URF:
 Verification needing a user-provided resource runs first,
 before other work or other parts of the task;
 scope growth never defers it;
 not done until the resource is exercised.

### Verify on a throwaway, not against real state

THR:
 State-mutating verification uses disposable fixtures (`mktemp -d`,
 throwaway worktree,
 container),
 never real or shared state,
 even when idempotent;
 guard tests need allowed and rejected fixtures.

TAE:
 Before prescribing tool/API behavior in prompts,
 docs,
 configs,
 or CI scripts,
 test it with a real invocation,
 never from how it should work.

## When committing or documenting

### Documentation standards

#### Prose style

WR2:
 Prose never uses em-dashes,
 en-dashes,
 or ASCII substitutes for them:
 use paired commas/parentheses,
 colon,
 semicolon,
 or period;
 "to" for ranges.
Hyphenated compounds and CLI `--flags` are fine.

WR3:
 Emphasis:
 **bold** inline only;
 never italics or ALL CAPS.

WR4:
 Numerals only where exact count,
 order,
 version,
 ID,
 or measurement matters;
 prefer count-neutral wording;
 mention list length only when it is the claim.

WR5:
 Never point by relative position ("above",
 "below",
 "earlier");
 name the tag,
 heading,
 path,
 or symbol,
 in prose,
 TSDoc,
 and comments.

WR6:
 A moved identifier (URL,
 host,
 path,
 name) in a historical record keeps its original text
 plus an in-place note giving the current value and the move date;
 never leave it pointing nowhere.

#### Markdown syntax

MD1:
 Break lines at semantic boundaries,
 under 120 chars,
 so text reads without editor wrapping.

MD2:
 `-` for unordered lists;
 pad numbered markers to 4 chars (`1.`,
 `10.`).

MD3:
 Fenced code blocks with language tags and file-path comments.

MD4:
 Reference-style links for repeated URLs;
 relative links for internal docs.

MD5:
 No tables (pipe or HTML);
 use headings or lists.

MD6:
 Headings:
 ATX,
 sentence case,
 max 4 levels,
 blank line before.
Standalone titles and labeled points become headings plus prose,
 never bold lines or bold-label bullets.

MD8:
 Hard wraps fall only between whole inline spans;
 keep code spans,
 emphasis,
 and link syntax on one line,
 or the closing delimiter renders literally.

WRP:
 Backtick file names,
 identifiers,
 commands,
 and code tokens in Markdown prose.

### Doc placement

DPL:
 Repo-wide docs live in `doc/`;
 root docs are only `README.md`,
 `SECURITY.md`,
 `AGENTS.md`,
 `CLAUDE.md`,
 `LICENSE`,
 `LICENSES/`.
Package docs stay beside code.

DL1:
 Repo-wide doc paths:
 `doc/<family>/<kebab-topic>.md`;
 a family index,
 if any,
 is `doc/<family>/README.md`.

DL3:
 Bug reports become a section of the most relevant `doc/troubleshooting/<topic>.md`,
 never their own family.

DL4:
 Delete a doc only when its work landed and no durable fact (root causes,
 workarounds,
 tradeoffs) lacks a new home;
 read it first;
 git history isn't a home.

DL5:
 Reference source files by repo-relative path,
 never pinned GitHub blob URLs,
 which break when targets move.

RBK:
 Repo-wide runbooks:
 `doc/runbook/<topic>.md`;
 handovers:
 `doc/handover/<topic>.md`;
 package-specific ones stay beside code.

### Handling external changes

EC1:
 Worktree changes you did not make are concurrent work,
 not emergencies:
 never restore,
 stash,
 or revert them;
 touch only task files.
Unrelated change blocks your edit:
 say so and ask.

### Git commit guidelines

GCE:
 Commit before the next work step,
 never waiting for verification or completion;
 broken states commit too,
 naming the breakage.
Overrides the harness ask-first default.

GCG:
 Commit subjects:
 `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`;
 scope:
 package name minus `@monochromatic-dev/`,
 doc family (`docs(planning)`),
 root file or tool name (`mise`,
 `AGENTS.md`),
 or `*` for multi-package.

GCB:
 Multi-package commit bodies:
 per package,
 `<type>(<package>): <what>`,
 blank line,
 `<why>`,
 in package order.

GCA:
 Inaccurate commit message:
 never amend;
 surface it,
 ask the user to push if auto-push is off,
 and post a corrective commit comment unasked.

CLG:
 Never preemptively bypass `git-policy-cli` guards (they reject bulk staging and pathspec-less commits):
 stage explicit scoped pathspecs;
 `--no-enforce-*` only when none fits.

CPN:
 Commit pathspecs name every new file:
 `git add F` then `git commit -- other/paths` omits `F`,
 leaving imports unresolvable at that commit;
 check `git status --short` after.

XCM:
 External messages report results,
 never work-inviting offers ("happy to",
 "want me to");
 user-only choices get asked before sending;
 necessary blocker questions to the recipient are fine.

## Architecture decisions

AD1:
 Root `package.json` may depend on workspace packages;
 root configs import them by package name.

AD2:
 Config needing logic (`if`,
 `map`,
 `await`):
 switch from data to TypeScript.

AD3:
 Run async work directly,
 not through descriptor/interpreter patterns.

AD4:
 Nested calls (`b(a())`) over method chaining;
 split more than two nested calls across lines,
 never stacked `)))`.

OCG:
 CLI option design:
 output cardinality never determines option occurrence grammar;
 sketch token encoding before asserting repeated,
 delimited,
 or variadic forms.

## Agent skills

SK1:
 **Issue tracker**:
 GitHub Issues via `gh`.
"Resolve issue N" authorizes fix + commit;
 `Closes #N` in the commit body auto-closes on auto-push.
See `doc/agent/issue-tracker.md`.

SK2:
 **Triage labels**:
 canonical roles with default label strings;
 see `doc/agent/triage-labels.md`.

SK3:
 **Domain docs**:
 no context files;
 agents read fresh code on every probe;
 see `doc/agent/domain.md`.
