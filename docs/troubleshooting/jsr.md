## Symptom

```bash
error: GET https://npm.jsr.io/@jsr%2fzod__zod - 502
error: zod@catalog: failed to resolve
```

Every JSR-hosted package (`@logtape/*`,
 `@optique/*`,
 `@cspotcode/outdent`,
 `zod`)
fails with `502 Bad Gateway` when Bun resolves them.
Non-JSR packages resolve fine.
`curl https://npm.jsr.io/@jsr/zod__zod` from the same host returns
200,
 which initially suggests a Bun-side bug;
 the real cause sits on the
JSR edge.

Tracked upstream:
 [jsr-io/jsr#1323](https://github.com/jsr-io/jsr/issues/1323).

## Root cause

JSR's npm compatibility layer is a Cloudflare-edge worker that returns
**502 Bad Gateway** when the request includes an `If-None-Match` header,
regardless of whether the etag is valid,
 stale,
 or garbage.

Bun's package manager maintains an HTTP cache at `~/.bun/install/cache/`
and sends `If-None-Match` from that cache on every subsequent fetch.
`curl` does not send conditional headers by default,
 which is why
ad-hoc manual probes succeed while `bun install` fails.

Per RFC 9110 Section 13.1.2,
 the server must return 304 (etag match) or
200 (no match) for a conditional GET.
 502 is never a valid response.
The defect lives on JSR's side;
 Bun's behaviour conforms to the HTTP
specification.

## Verification

Confirm the JSR edge still rejects conditional requests:

```sh
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" \
  -H 'If-None-Match: "any-value"' \
  "https://npm.jsr.io/@jsr/zod__zod"
```

- 502:
   the JSR bug is still present;
   the workaround below is still needed.
- 200 or 304:
   the upstream fix has landed;
   clear the cache once more,
  then the workaround can be retired.

Reproduce the failing install with:

```sh
bun pm cache rm   # ensure cache holds no etag yet
bun install       # populates cache; this run succeeds
bun install       # second run sends If-None-Match, fails with 502
```

## Verified workaround

Clear Bun's HTTP cache before each fresh resolution so no `If-None-Match`
header is sent:

```sh
bun pm cache rm
bun install
```

Or,
 equivalently,
 the workspace task:

```sh
mise run fix:jsr
```

Tradeoff:
 the cache is reset every time,
 so `bun install` does not benefit
from cached etag negotiation.
 On a workspace with hundreds of dependencies
the bandwidth cost is one full re-download of any JSR metadata that
otherwise would have validated with a 304.
 Tolerable;
 non-JSR caching is
unaffected.

## What does not work

- Editing `~/.bun/install/cache/` to remove only JSR etags:
   Bun does
  not expose per-entry deletion through any CLI;
   the cache file format
  is internal and unstable across versions.
- Setting `BUN_INSTALL_CACHE_DIR=/dev/null` or similar:
   forces a full
  re-resolve on every install but does not stop Bun from caching once
  it runs.
- Switching to `npm` or `pnpm` for installs:
   avoids Bun's conditional
  GET (those clients do not send `If-None-Match` from disk caches in
  the same way),
   but loses Bun's catalog-aware install paths used
  elsewhere in this workspace.

## Why we do not file this upstream

JSR's tracker already has [jsr-io/jsr#1323](https://github.com/jsr-io/jsr/issues/1323)
open against this exact behaviour,
 so a fresh report would duplicate
without adding evidence.
 Walking the five constraints anyway:

1. **Is it really upstream's fault?
   ** Yes.
    The edge worker is the one
   violating RFC 9110.
2. **Can upstream fix it?
   ** Yes;
    either accept conditional GET and
   return 304/200,
    or drop incoming `If-None-Match` headers before they
   reach the cache.
3. **Are they supporting this use case?
   ** The npm-compat bridge is the
   advertised on-ramp for npm tooling;
    Bun is npm-compat tooling.
4. **Will they likely fix it?
   ** The existing issue has been quiet since
   filing;
    no movement in the JSR repo's release notes touches the
   conditional-GET path.
    Not optimistic.
5. **Have we prototyped a minimal fix?
   ** Not applicable;
    the JSR worker
   is closed-source from this repo's vantage point,
    and a workspace
   patch is impossible.

Decision:
 keep the workaround in `mise run fix:jsr`;
 re-evaluate when
issue #1323 closes or shows movement.
