# `@monochromatic-dev/module-test` test harness: confusing error chains with duplicate describes, skipped tests after first failure, shared-state flakes, assertion-count + sinon-restore pitfalls

This file groups five independent quirks of the in-tree test harness
(`@monochromatic-dev/module-test`).
 Each gets its own canonical
section.

## Bug 1: Duplicate `describe` names at the same scope produce ambiguous error chains

### Symptom

Test output reports a failing test under the wrong suite name,
 or
two suites print the same name,
 making it hard to locate the
actual failure:

```text
FAIL  suite-name > test-a   ← which "suite-name"?
FAIL  suite-name > test-b   ← (there are two)
```

### Root cause

`describe` propagates child failures as
`new Error(name, { cause: childError })`.
 When two sibling
describes share the same `name`,
 both errors wrap their causes with
the same message string.
 The runner's output cannot distinguish
them;
 the cause chain is technically correct (the `cause` field
preserves the inner error),
 but the human-readable summary loses
the disambiguation.

The harness does not merge or deduplicate suites with the same name
(unlike bun:
test's reporter),
 so the output prints both with their
shared name verbatim.

### Verification

Version under test:
 `@monochromatic-dev/module-test` at workspace
HEAD.

Reproduce:

```ts
await describe({
  name: 'root',
  children: [
    describe({ name: 'dup', children: [it({ name: 'a', fn: () => {
      throw new Error('boom',);
    }, },),], },),
    describe({ name: 'dup', children: [it({ name: 'b', fn: () => {}, },),], },),
  ],
},);
// Output: both "dup" lines visible; failure attribution requires
// reading the cause chain manually.
```

### Verified workaround

Keep `describe` names unique within a scope:

- Prefer `functionName.name` for imported functions;
   that is
  inherently unique per import.
- Use region markers (`//region X` / `//endregion`) to visually
  separate groups and catch accidental duplication during review.

Tradeoff:
 enforced by convention,
 not by the runner.
 A future
linter rule could detect duplicates but is not in place.

### What does not work

- Renaming nested suites only:
   top-level duplicates still produce
  the ambiguous chain.
- Relying on the cause chain in output:
   present but not surfaced
  by the default reporter.

### Why we do not file this upstream

The runner is in-tree.
 Walking the 5 constraints as if `module-test`
were the upstream:

1. **Is it really upstream's fault?
   ** Borderline.
    Deduplication
   matching bun:
   test's reporter would help but adds complexity.
2. **Can upstream fix it?
   ** Yes;
    augment the reporter to mark
   duplicates with a suffix or path.
3. **Are they supporting this use case?
   ** The runner accepts any
   name;
    duplicates are not rejected.
4. **Will they likely fix it?
   ** Not at this priority.
5. **Have we prototyped a minimal fix?
   ** No.

Decision:
 keep the convention rule.

## Bug 2: Multiple top-level `await describe(...)` calls; first failure skips the rest

### Symptom

A test file has multiple top-level `await describe({ ... })` calls.
The first one fails;
 the second never runs:

```text
FAIL  suite A > test-1
(no further output for suite B; process exits)
```

### Root cause

`describe` throws on child failure.
 Multiple `await describe(...)`
at the top level means a throw in the first kills the surrounding
module evaluation,
 so subsequent describes never reach the
scheduling step.

### Verification

```ts
await describe({ name: 'A', children: [it({ name: 'fails', fn: () => {
  throw new Error('boom',);
}, },),], },);
await describe({ name: 'B',
  children: [it({ name: 'never runs', fn: () => {}, },),], },);
// Suite B is silently skipped.
```

### Verified workaround

Wrap all suites in a single empty-named parent describe.
 The empty
parent runs children through `Promise.allSettled`,
 so every suite
executes regardless of earlier failures:

```ts
await describe({
  name: '',
  children: [
    describe({ name: 'A', children: [...] }),
    describe({ name: 'B', children: [...] }),
  ],
});
```

Tradeoff:
 every test file has a wrapper at the top.
 Trivial
boilerplate but easy to forget;
 reviewing for two top-level
`await describe(...)` calls is the simplest catch.

### What does not work

- Wrapping each describe in its own try/catch:
   catches the error,
  but the runner does not see the original failure for reporting.
- Using `Promise.all` over `Promise.allSettled`:
   same fail-fast
  behaviour as sequential awaits.

### Why we do not file this upstream

1. **Is it really upstream's fault?
   ** Borderline.
    The throw-on-fail
   contract is intentional;
    the wrapper pattern is the documented
   shape.
2. **Can upstream fix it?
   ** Could change top-level behaviour to use
   `allSettled` implicitly,
    but that hides bugs where the file
   forgets to declare a parent.
3. **Are they supporting this use case?
   ** Yes;
    the wrapper pattern
   is documented.
4. **Will they likely fix it?
   ** No.
5. **Have we prototyped a minimal fix?
   ** N/A.

Decision:
 keep the wrapper convention.

## Bug 3: Concurrent tests sharing mutable state interfere

### Symptom

Tests pass individually but fail when run together.
 Assertions see
values written by another test.
 Failures depend on execution order
and are flaky on reruns.

### Root cause

Children of a describe run concurrently by default (via
`Promise.allSettled`).
 Tests that mutate module-level state
(counters,
 caches,
 singletons) race with their siblings.

### Verification

```ts
// module under test:
let counter = 0;
export function increment(): number {
  return ++counter;
}

// tests:
describe({
  name: 'counter',
  children: [
    it({ name: 'first call returns 1',
      fn: ({ expect, },) => expect(increment(),).toBe(1,), },),
    it({ name: 'second call returns 2',
      fn: ({ expect, },) => expect(increment(),).toBe(2,), },),
  ],
},);
// Both run concurrently; one of them returns 2 first, the other returns 1,
// the assertion ordering breaks.
```

### Verified workaround

Isolate state per test (preferred):
 create fresh state inside each
`fn`,
 so siblings cannot interfere.

When shared state is unavoidable,
 set `concurrency: 1` on the
describe:

```ts
describe({
  name: 'shared resource',
  concurrency: 1,
  children: [
    it({ name: 'first', fn: async () => {/* ... */}, },),
    it({ name: 'second', fn: async () => {/* ... */}, },),
  ],
},);
```

Children are lazy descriptors and dispatched by the parent,
 so no
thunk wrapping is needed;
 the parent's effective concurrency is
inherited by nested describes.

Tradeoff:
 `concurrency: 1` serialises the whole describe,
 which
slows the suite.
 Use it only when isolation is genuinely
impractical.

### What does not work

- Restructuring tests to "assume execution order":
   the runner does
  not promise order;
   even with `concurrency: 1`,
   relying on order
  outside the explicit sequencing is fragile.
- Wrapping shared state in a `Map` keyed by test name:
   works but
  spreads state-tracking concerns into every test;
   the runner-level
  `concurrency: 1` is cleaner.

### Why we do not file this upstream

The default-concurrent behaviour is intentional.
 Walking the
constraints concludes:
 no upstream report;
 document the convention.

## Bug 4: `expect.assertions(n)` only works when destructured from the test context

### Symptom

`expect.assertions(n)` is not available on the imported `expect`:

```ts
import { expect, } from '@monochromatic-dev/module-test';
// `expect.assertions` is undefined.
```

Worse,
 async tests where one branch never reaches its assertion
silently pass,
 because no count is being enforced.

### Root cause

The global `expect` (imported directly from the package) does not
support assertion counting.
 Only the scoped `expect` from the test
context (passed via `fn`'s parameter) tracks counts;
 that is the
instance that has the `assertions` method.

### Verification

```ts
import {
  describe,
  expect as globalExpect,
  it,
} from '@monochromatic-dev/module-test';

await describe({
  name: 'count check',
  children: [
    it({
      name: 'scoped',
      fn: async ({ expect, },) => {
        expect.assertions(2,); // works
        expect(await fetchA(),).toBe('a',);
        expect(await fetchB(),).toBe('b',);
      },
    },),
    it({
      name: 'global',
      fn: async () => {
        globalExpect.assertions(2,); // TypeError or undefined
      },
    },),
  ],
},);
```

### Verified workaround

Always destructure `expect` from the `fn` parameter:

```ts
it({
  name: 'all branches assert',
  fn: async ({ expect, },) => {
    expect.assertions(2,);
    expect(await fetchA(),).toBe('a',);
    expect(await fetchB(),).toBe('b',);
  },
},);
```

Tradeoff:
 every test that needs assertion counting must use the
scoped form.
 The global `expect` is still useful for ad-hoc
assertions,
 but should not be used inside `fn`.

### What does not work

- Patching `expect.assertions` onto the global instance:
   the
  counter state lives in the per-test context,
   so a shimmed global
  cannot find the right counter.
- Relying on the test runner to detect unreached assertions
  heuristically:
   not implemented;
   assertion counting is the only
  guarantee.

### Why we do not file this upstream

In-tree harness.
 The scoped-only design is intentional (state lives
in the context).
 Walking the constraints concludes no upstream
report.

## Bug 5: `sinon` imported directly leaks stubs across tests

### Symptom

A stub installed in test A is still installed when test B runs.
Test B fails with "TypeError:
 Attempted to wrap …" because the
already-wrapped method cannot be wrapped a second time.

### Root cause

The directly-imported `sinon` is the singleton;
 stubs installed on
it persist until explicitly restored.
 The per-test `sinon` exposed
via context is wrapped in a sandbox that auto-restores at the end
of the test (via `await using`).

### Verification

```ts
import sinon from 'sinon';

it({
  name: 'stubs leak',
  fn: async () => {
    sinon.stub(obj, 'method',).returns('mocked',);
    // No restore; the stub persists into the next test.
  },
},);
```

### Verified workaround

Use `ctx.sinon` from the test context:

```ts
it({
  name: 'stubs cleanly',
  fn: async ({ sinon, },) => {
    sinon.stub(obj, 'method',).returns('mocked',);
    // Sandbox auto-restores via `await using`.
  },
},);
```

Tradeoff:
 every test that needs stubs must destructure `sinon` from
the context.
 Refactoring legacy tests that import `sinon` directly
is mechanical but tedious.

### What does not work

- Calling `sinon.restore()` manually in a `finally` block:
   works
  but reintroduces the boilerplate the sandbox replaced;
   missing a
  single `finally` re-creates the leak.
- Wrapping every test in `beforeEach`/`afterEach`:
   this runner does
  not have lifecycle hooks;
   the sandbox model is the substitute.

### Why we do not file this upstream

In-tree convention;
 sinon itself is upstream-correct.
 No
upstream report.
