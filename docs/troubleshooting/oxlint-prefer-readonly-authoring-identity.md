# Semantic readonly checks for identity-preserving policy authoring APIs

## Symptom

Cli-git's authoring helpers preserve caller-provided declarations by identity:

```typescript
const options = definePolicyOptions(schema);
const policy = definePolicy(definition);
```

A shallow `Readonly<T>` did not satisfy the former native
`typescript/prefer-readonly-parameter-types` rule.
The values contain Valibot schemas,
callbacks,
and generic input/output positions,
so their complete structures are not deeply readonly.

The same issue appears in internal policy registries and adapters that retain executable callbacks for sequencing and
failure-path tests.

## Root cause

These APIs make an ownership promise,
not a structural immutability promise.
The helper receives a caller-owned runtime capability and must return or store the same identity.
Cloning,
freezing,
or projecting the value would change the API contract.

Valibot `1.4.2` defines `GenericSchema` as an alias of `BaseSchema` in its published `dist/index.d.mts`.
That contract includes callable behavior and generic positions whose effects are not represented by `Readonly<T>`.
Cli-git's `PolicyDefinition` in `packages/git-policies/api/src/policy-types.ts` combines a schema with an executable
policy callback.

A type-name allowlist cannot prove that a particular function observes the capability without invoking or mutating it.
Conversely,
treating every method as readonly would hide genuine mutable map,
set,
and class state elsewhere.

## Verified resolution

The public authoring boundary states foreign ownership exactly once:

```typescript
export function definePolicyOptions<const TInput, const TOutput>(
  schema: ForeignBorrowed<GenericSchema<TInput, TOutput>>,
): GenericSchema<TInput, TOutput> {
  return schema;
}

export function definePolicy<
  const TOptions,
  const TName extends string,
>(
  definition: ForeignBorrowed<PolicyDefinition<Readonly<TOptions>, TName>>,
): PolicyDefinition<Readonly<TOptions>, TName> {
  return definition;
}
```

The corresponding sources are:

- `packages/git-policies/api/src/authoring.ts`;
- `packages/git-policies/cli/src/api/authoring.ts`.

`ForeignBorrowed` records that the object and its reachable capabilities remain caller-owned.
It does not claim structural immutability.
The semantic rule still verifies direct mutations,
callback invocation,
unknown calls,
and transitive effects.
Actual caller-observable effects require complete `@mutates` contracts.

Descendant properties,
aliases,
callback parameters,
and internal helpers do not repeat the marker.
Guaranteed foreign provenance flows through property and element access,
destructuring,
owned calls,
audited callbacks,
and synchronous iteration.
A helper inherits that provenance only when every owned inbound call supplies wholly foreign mutable state.

## Verification

The original native-rule investigation established that:

- `Readonly<GenericSchema<TInput, TOutput>>` still reported;
- `Readonly<PolicyDefinition<Readonly<TOptions>, TName>>` still reported;
- adding `GenericSchema` and resolved `BaseSchema` names to a package allowlist did not fix nested behavior.

The current source check is:

```sh
rg --line-number "ForeignBorrowed<GenericSchema|ForeignBorrowed<PolicyDefinition" \
  packages/git-policies/api/src/authoring.ts \
  packages/git-policies/cli/src/api/authoring.ts
```

Both public authoring mirrors place the marker on the actual ingress parameter.
The full cli-git semantic migration remains an active package in
`docs/planning/replace-prefer-readonly-parameter-types.md`;
this document does not claim that every cli-git finding is resolved.

The semantic rule's provenance fixtures separately cover:

- property and element descendants;
- nested destructuring and aliases;
- owned helper calls;
- audited array callbacks;
- synchronous `for...of` elements;
- mixed foreign and owned inbound paths.

## What does not work

### Wrap the capability in `Readonly`

`Readonly` changes only surface property modifiers.
It does not rewrite nested schemas,
callbacks,
or behavioral capabilities,
and it can falsely suggest semantic immutability.

### Add schema aliases to a global allowlist

A type name does not establish ownership or effects at one call boundary.
It would also exempt unrelated uses of the same capability type.

### Clone or deeply freeze the declaration

The authoring API promises exact identity.
Transforming the value would violate that contract and could change third-party schema behavior.

### Treat every method as readonly

That broad setting can hide real mutation through maps,
sets,
and stateful capabilities.

### Mark every descendant `ForeignBorrowed`

Repeating the marker obscures where foreign ownership entered and can hide a helper that also receives ordinary owned
mutable input.
The semantic provenance index must carry the boundary fact instead.

### Use `@mutates` when no caller-observable effect exists

A contract must describe real effects,
not an analyzer limitation.
Identity helpers that only return their input need no invented mutation statement.

## Upstream filing artifact

### Upstream filing decision

1. **Is it really upstream's fault?** No. Structural readonly rules correctly cannot infer this repository's ownership
   boundary from a third-party capability type.
2. **Can upstream fix it?** Not without a project-specific ownership and effect model.
3. **Are they supporting this use case?** The native rule supports structural type checks,
   not exact identity-preserving capability contracts.
4. **Would the repo welcome our contribution?** No generally applicable upstream change was identified.
5. **Will they likely fix it?** Not applicable because no upstream defect is claimed.
6. **Have we prototyped a minimal fix compatible with their architecture?** The project-owned marker,
   TypeScript 7 semantic bridge,
   provenance propagation,
   and verified effect contracts are the implemented fix.

Nothing should be filed upstream.

## Source audit boundary

The investigation followed the published Valibot declaration to cli-git's public authoring and policy-definition
sources.
A repository search found the related branded-nesting and ESTree documents;
they cover different type-resolution mechanisms.
No `.out-of-scope` directory applies to this documentation path.
