# BUG-8 default and hardened find_all return different results

## Classification

- Type:
   correctness,
   the two find_all algorithms disagree.
- Phase:
   match time.
- Severity:
   soundness.
   At least one of the two paths is wrong,
   and the default
  path is the one used unless the caller opts into hardening.

## Minimal reproducer

```rust
use resharp::{Regex, RegexOptions, Match};
let pat = r"~(_a+)";
let def = Regex::new(pat).unwrap();
let hard = Regex::with_options(pat, RegexOptions::default().hardened(true)).unwrap();
let hay = b"aaa";
assert_eq!(def.find_all(hay).unwrap(), hard.find_all(hay).unwrap()); // FAILS
// default:  [(0,1),(1,2),(2,3),(3,3)]
// hardened: [(0,2),(2,3),(3,3)]
```

Command line:

```sh
repro '~(_a+)' --sweep | grep HARDDIFF
```

## Observed behaviour

```text
HARDDIFF_FA|def=[(0,1),(1,2),(2,3),(3,3)]|hard=[(0,2),(2,3),(3,3)]|hay=616161|pat="~(_a+)"
```

On `aaa`,
 the default engine starts its first match as `(0,1)` and the hardened
engine as `(0,2)`.
 Under leftmost-longest these must be identical.

## Expected behaviour

Hardening only swaps the scan algorithm (`FindAll::Hardened` forces the general
`find_all_dfa` path;
 the default selects an optimised `Bounded`,
 `FwdPrefix`,
 or
`FwdLbPrefix` path).
 The language and therefore the match set are unchanged,
 so
`find_all` must be identical between the two.

## Root cause

`resharp-engine/src/lib.rs`,
 `compute_find_all` and the `find_all` dispatcher.
The default build picks an optimised forward path
(`find_all_fwd_bounded`,
 `find_all_fwd_prefix`,
 `find_all_fwd_lb_prefix`);
 the
hardened build forces `find_all_dfa` (the `FindAll::Hardened` arm).
 The
disagreement means one of the optimised paths computes a wrong match end or
start for these shapes.
 The hardened general path is the more trustworthy
reference.

## Distinct triggers

14 distinct patterns in the first 80k-pattern sweep.
 They split into groups that
matter for triage because they implicate different optimised paths and are
distinct from BUG-7:

- Complement only:
   `~(_a+)`,
   `~(aa*a)` (minimised from
  `~(([a-c](?:a)*|_\S))`),
   `~((b{0}[^a]{2,2}(()|[^\w]+)|c*))`.
- Anchor only:
   `^{2,2}(?=())[^\w]{0,1}`,
   `^{2,2}[\w]\W{0,2}` (double start
  anchor),
   `((?![\w])()|_*\A{0,2}c)`.
- Mixed with perl classes (overlaps BUG-7):
   several containing `\S`,
   `\D`,
   `\W`.

## Notes

- This is the same class as the already-tracked "hardened find_all drops
  zero-width matches at input boundaries",
   but these triggers are
  complement-based and anchor-based and reproduce on current `main`,
   so the
  prior zero-width fix does not cover them.
- `~(a+)`,
   `~(aa)`,
   `~(a)` do not trigger;
   the leading `_` (any byte) before the
  quantified run is required:
   `~(_a+)`.
- The trigger generalizes from `_` to any leading atom concatenated with the
  complement,
   confirmed by a later directed default-vs-hardened sweep
  (`repro --hardbatch`):
   `a~(a+)`,
   `\w~(a+)`,
   `.~(a+)`,
   `[a-c]~(a+)`,
   and
  `a{1,3}~(a+)` all reproduce,
   every one with the identical signature
  `def=[(0,1),(1,2),...]` versus `hard=[(0,2),...]` (the hardened path over-extends
  the first span by one).
   On `"aaa"`,
   the default is correct:
   leftmost-longest
  `X~(a+)` matches a single leading char followed by the empty string (the only
  substring of a trailing `a`-run that is not in `a+`),
   so single-byte spans are
  right and the hardened `(0,2)` is the wrong side.
   So the required shape is
  `<one-atom><complement-of-a-quantified-run>`,
   of which `~(_a+)` is the special
  case where the leading atom is folded into the complement as `_`.
   Same root
  cause (one optimised forward path versus `find_all_dfa`);
   not a separate bug.
