md rule:

> No em-dashes (`—`),
>  en-dashes (`–`),
>  or their ASCII substitutes (`-`,
>  `--`)
> when used in prose as em-dashes;
>  all such uses are informal.
> Use paired commas or parentheses for asides,
>  colon for elaboration or lists,
> semicolon for linked independent clauses,
>  period for abrupt breaks.
> Use "to" for ranges.
>  Hyphens remain fine in compound words ("user-facing"),
> and `--` remains fine in CLI flags (`--watch`);
>  the ban applies only to em-dash use.

Intentional content (preserved by exclusion list):
 `AUDIT.em-dash.md` itself
(self-references),
 `PLANNING.forbidden-strings-em-dash.md`,
`packages/cli/forbidden-strings/README.md`,
 `AGENTS.md` (rule statement in
backticks),
 `GLM_LIMITATIONS.md` (documents model violations),
`HANDOVER.em-dash-sweep-issue-55.md` (handover doc with em-dash examples
in backticks),
 and `packages/module/hyperscript/src/css/index.unit.test.ts`
(en-dash as CSS counter-style symbol).
 The MD `--` sweep also excluded
`TODO.claude-code-words.md` and `TODO.forbidden-strings.md` because both
intentionally use `--` as definition markers.

Remaining ASCII `--` instances are CLI argument separators preserved by the
sweep heuristic:
 lines that look like CLI invocations (`mise`,
 `git`,
`npm`,
 etc. as first token),
 text inside fenced code blocks,
 inline
backtick spans,
 and `oxlint-disable`/`eslint-disable`/`biome-disable`
directives (which use `--` as a syntactic rule/reason separator).

Remaining ASCII `-` instances are list bullets at line start (`- item`),
markdown bullets within TSDoc comments,
 subtraction in math expressions,
identifiers and CLI flags,
 dashes in compound words ("user-facing"),
TSDoc `@param name - description` separators (per TSDoc convention),
 and
mid-prose dashes the conservative marker-after-close heuristic skipped
to avoid false positives.

The remaining `forbidden-strings` rule to prevent regressions is tracked
in a separate follow-up issue.

## A. Em-dash (`—`) prose asides

Replace with paired commas,
 parentheses,
 colon,
 semicolon,
 or period.

   <>If you write this as <code>{`<a href="/logout">`}</code>,

   but a plain button can't tell a screen reader whether shuffle is currently on or off.
   Add <code>{`aria-pressed="true"
