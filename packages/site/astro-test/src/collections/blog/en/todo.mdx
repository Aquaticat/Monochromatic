## Severity - most severe

* Search doesn't work.

* Searchbar is bigger than viewport on mobile.

* "-> en" and "-> zh" need to be better styled.

* links on `.Post` cards are behind the card itself's bigger link, therefore unclickable. Investigate using https://css-tricks.com/nested-links/

## Severity - medium

* Write more posts - make sure this looks like a portfolio of someone you want to hire.
