/**
 * Static-asset compression stage entry: zstd-compress dist/ via node:zlib across
 * worker_threads.
 *
 * Replaces the former `zstd ... -r --adapt dist` CLI task. The build runs under
 * Node; Node's async zstdCompress is pathological here,
 * so each worker calls synchronous zstdCompressSync. The main thread snapshots
 * the candidate set before spawning any worker, so no worker observes a `.zst`
 * being created mid-run; existing `.zst` files are excluded from candidates, and
 * symlinks are skipped via lstat so recursion can't escape dist/.
 *
 * This file is the self-referential worker entry: each worker re-runs it via
 * `new Worker(new URL(import.meta.url))` and takes the worker branch below. The
 * pure logic (heuristic, distribution, compression) lives in `./compress-lib.ts`.
 *
 * Run via `mise run build:compress` or `node src/build/compress.ts`.
 *
 * @see docs/decisions/zstd-cli-to-node-zlib.md for the engine, level, and threading evidence.
