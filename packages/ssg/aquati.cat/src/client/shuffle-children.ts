/**
 * Client-side fallback that reorders the direct children of every
 * `<shuffle-children>` element in browsers that do not yet support CSS `random()`.
 *
 * The {@link ShuffleChildren} component sets `display: flex` on `<shuffle-children>`
 * and `order: random(1, 1000, by 1)` on each direct child to shuffle visually.
 * Browsers that do not support CSS `random()` drop the `order` declaration and
 * every child falls back to the default `order: 0`, leaving them in source order,
 * which defeats the shuffle.
 *
 * This script detects the missing support via `CSS.supports` and reorders the
 * DOM nodes directly so the shuffle still happens. In supporting browsers the
 * script is a no-op; the CSS path takes effect and runs off the main thread
 * without layout shift.
 *
 * The DOM-reorder happens at module-load time. The bundle entry that imports
 * this file is loaded with `type="module"`, which is render-blocking but
 * executed before first paint, so the reorder applies before the user sees
 * any of the wrapped content.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import './shuffle-children.ts';
 * ```
