/**
 * Creates an ephemeral libvirt VM, executes a command inside it, and destroys
 * the VM. When `from` is provided, the VM is cloned from that source; otherwise
 * a fresh VM is created from the base image.
 *
 * Delegates to the backend-neutral {@link ephemeralRun}, supplying the libvirt
 * create/clone/destroy/exec operations, so teardown on interruption is handled
 * in one shared place.
 *
 * @param command - shell command to run inside the VM
 *
 * @param from - source VM to clone from (creates fresh VM when undefined)
 *
 * @returns captured stdout, stderr, and exit code from the command
 *
 * @throws Error when VM creation, command execution, or cleanup fails
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const result = await run({ command: 'uname -a' });
 * // Creates a fresh VM, runs the command, destroys it
 *
 * const cloned = await run({ command: 'cat /etc/hostname', from: 'dev-01' });
 * // Clones from dev-01, runs the command, destroys the clone
 * ```
