/**
 * Non-streaming chat-completion response shapes for OpenAI-compatible APIs.
 *
 * Designed as a superset of what each consumer reads: every field beyond
 * `choices[].message.content` is optional, so a consumer's unchecked
 * `as ChatCompletionResponse` cast keeps compiling and `message.content`
 * stays a non-null `string`. A consumer that also needs token usage composes
 * {@link ChatCompletionResponse} with {@link CompletionUsage}, for example
 * `ChatCompletionResponse & { readonly usage: CompletionUsage }`, rather than
 * redeclaring the response.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import type { ChatCompletionResponse } from '@monochromatic-dev/module-llm-type';
 *
 * const data = (await response.json()) as ChatCompletionResponse;
 * const text = data.choices[0]?.message.content ?? '';
 * ```
 *
 * @module
 */

/**
 * Single choice returned in a non-streaming chat completion.
 *
 * Only `message.content` is required, because that is the one field every
 * consumer reads; `role` is optional so a response carrying it still matches
 * while content-only responses (vision callers) match too. This keeps every
 * existing `as ChatCompletionResponse` cast valid without a null branch.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const choice: ChatCompletionChoice = { message: { content: 'Done.', }, };
 * ```
