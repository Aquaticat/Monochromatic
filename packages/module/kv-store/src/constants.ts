/**
 * Sentinel marking the absence of a value across the store's read pipeline.
 *
 * Distinguishes "no backend holds this key" (and "no key was evicted") from any
 * real serialized or deserialized value, including a stored `null`. A unique
 * module-local `Symbol` is used so it can never collide with a domain value:
 * strings, numbers, `null`, and `undefined` are all values the store may
 * legitimately round-trip, so none of them can serve as the missing marker.
 *
 * Narrow against it with an identity check (`value === ABSENT`).
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const value = await store.get<number>('count');
 * if (value === ABSENT) {
 *   // key is missing; seed a default
 * }
 * ```
