 * ecma402#980); magnitude-driven unit selection is out of charter and
 * was punted to a hypothetical `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat` v2 (ecma402#498,
 * still open); the `'narrow'` style produces space-separated, locale-
 * specific suffixes (`Xh Ym` with literal space, `週` in Japanese)
 * whereas the app needs ASCII compact without spaces; and the 30-day /
 * 365-day month / year decomposition is app-domain, not Intl-default.

 * disambiguates the reused `m`: `1y2m` is years + months because of
 * the `y`, `1h30m` is hours + minutes because of the `h`, and standalone
 * `Xm` never occurs because seconds-only renders as `Xs`.
 *
 * Magnitude ladder (each row pairs the largest non-zero unit with the
 * next smaller unit; weeks/days/hours/minutes/seconds are exact, months
 * approximate at {@link DAYS_PER_MONTH} days, years approximate at
 * {@link DAYS_PER_YEAR} days):

 * Strict adjacency loses precision when the secondary unit is zero but
 * a tertiary is non-zero (e.g. 35 days renders `1m0w` and the trailing
 * 5 days are dropped). Acceptable cost for visual stability during live
 * timer ticks. Near the year boundary (12 months = 360d vs 1 year =
 * 365d) the same task class can render `12m0w` at 12 months and
