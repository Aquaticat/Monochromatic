# Path Length Limitations

Due to the extensive length of file names in this directory structure, some file names have been abbreviated to avoid git long path errors.

The alternative approach of enabling `git config --system core.longpaths true` was not implemented because:

> "Git is built as a combination of scripts and compiled code. With the above change some of the scripts might fail. That's the reason for core.longpaths not to be enabled by default."

This abbreviated naming convention ensures compatibility across different operating systems and git configurations while maintaining the logical organization of TypeScript type definitions.
