 * The function does no extra work; it exists so call sites read the same

 * a hand-rolled one.
 *
 * @param spec - manually constructed locale spec
 *
 * @returns same spec, typed
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const fr = defineCustomLocale({
 *   renderLabel: (key) => frenchLabels[key],
 *   renderNoun: (key) => frenchNouns[key].surface,
 *   renderNounPhrase: (phrase) => { ... },
 *   renderVerbPhrase: (phrase) => { ... },
 *   renderSentence: (sentence) => { ... },
 *   renderFragment: (fragment) => { ... },
 * });
