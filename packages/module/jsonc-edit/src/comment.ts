/**
 * Comment attached to a JSONC node.
 *
 * A node carries at most one `JsoncComment`. When several `//` or block comments
 * stack against the same node, the parser merges them into a single comment of
 * type `mixed` whose `text` joins the bodies with newlines. The body is stored
 * untrimmed so markers like `//region` survive a round-trip.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const inline: JsoncComment = { type: 'inline', text: ' a name' };
 * const merged: JsoncComment = { type: 'mixed', text: 'region config\n a name' };
 * ```
