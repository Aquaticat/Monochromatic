/**
 * Asserts that a value is a `WeakSet`, returning it with non-`WeakSet` variants
 * removed from the type.
 *
 * Uses `instanceof WeakSet`, which is the correct predicate inside a single
 * realm. `WeakSet` has no enumerable size or iteration, so this helper is
 * useful mainly for type-narrowing branches that want to distinguish weak
 * containers from regular ones.
 * The return type uses {@link ExtractOrUnknown} so `unknown` inputs narrow to
 * `WeakSet<object>` instead of collapsing to `never`.
 *
 * @param value - Value to assert as a `WeakSet`
 *
 * @returns Same value with non-`WeakSet` variants excluded from the type
 *
 * @throws Error when value is not a `WeakSet`
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const maybeWeak: WeakSet<object> | Set<object> = lookup();
 * const onlyWeak = weakSetOrThrow(maybeWeak,);
 * // onlyWeak is WeakSet<object>
 * ```
