/**
 * Maps every item of a sync or async iterable through an async `fn`, eagerly and
 * with unbounded concurrency, collecting results into an array in input order.
 *
 * Eager, not lazy: every `fn` call is started during iteration, before any result
 * is awaited, so all mappers run at the same time. This is a collect-to-array
 * mapper, not a lazy async-iterator transform that yields one value at a time.
 *
 * @param fn - async mapper invoked once per item; every call starts eagerly so the calls overlap
 *
 * @param iterable - sync or async source whose items feed `fn`
 *
 * @returns mapped results in input order, one per source item
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { mapIterableAsync, } from '\@monochromatic-dev/module-async-iter';
 *
 * const sizes = await mapIterableAsync({
 *   fn: async (url,) => (await fetch(url,)).headers.get('content-length',),
 *   iterable: ['/a', '/b', '/c',],
 * },);
 * ```
