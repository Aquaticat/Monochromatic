/**
 * Enforces at most two counted invocation heads per source line on an operand spine.
 *
 * A counted invocation is a `CallExpression` (including optional calls),
 * `NewExpression`, or `ImportExpression`. The rule walks each operand spine, the
 * chain of single-argument invocations threaded through transparent wrappers
 * (`await`, unary, `yield`, spread, `!`, `as`, `satisfies`, type assertion,
 * optional-chaining), and counts how many invocation heads begin on each source
 * line. A line carrying three or more heads fails; the highest invocation on
 * that line is reported, and the fix splits its single operand onto its own
 * line. The rule is threshold-only: an already-split layout passes when every
 * line stays within the limit. Multi-argument calls belong to {@link argumentPerLine}
 * and callee chains to {@link chainPerLine}, so this rule descends only the single
 * operand and leaves those axes alone; the fix may overlap theirs and converges
 * over repeated `oxlint --fix` passes.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // Bad
 * const value = a(b(c()));
 *
 * // Good
 * const value = a(
 *   b(c()),
 * );
 *
 * // Good: depth two stays on one line
 * const value = a(b());
 * ```
