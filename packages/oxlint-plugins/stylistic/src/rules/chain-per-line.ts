/**
 * Enforces one chain segment per source line for binary, logical, member, and
 * call chains, laying out the operator and member axes independently.
 *
 * Firing once on the outermost chain root, the rule computes break offsets on
 * decoupled axes: a member or call chain breaks on its own member-step count,
 * and an operator chain breaks on its own operator count, so neither axis
 * inflates the other. A member chain keeps the leaf and the first member step on
 * the head line and breaks every later step; an operator chain keeps the
 * source-first operator on the head line and breaks the rest. A single operator
 * whose operand is a member access (`a.b === c`) therefore stays on one line,
 * while a multi-step member operand breaks and carries its operator onto a line
 * of its own (`a.b.c > 0` becomes `a.b` then `.c` then `> 0`). Computed access
 * (`[expr]`) and call steps (`(args)`) stay attached, so `arr[0][1]` and
 * `obj.method()` keep to one line. It reports when the region's source differs
 * from this canonical layout and replaces the whole region in one fix, except
 * when a comment sits in the collapsible head (before the first break), where it
 * reports without a fix; a comment at or after the first break (such as one in a
 * trailing call's arguments) rides verbatim on its continuation slice, so the
 * fix still applies. The fix only inserts newlines at break offsets and slices
 * everything else verbatim, so it never collapses whitespace at non-break
 * points: a legacy split with no break offsets is left as-is rather than
 * rejoined.
 * `no-mixed-operators` runs alongside and remains the authority on precedence
 * parentheses; on a shared region their fixes need two `oxlint --fix` passes (an
 * upstream single-pass limitation).
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // Bad
 * const r1 = a + b + c;
 * const r2 = items.map(toName).filter(isReady).sort();
 *
 * // Good
 * const r1 = a + b
 *   + c;
 * const r2 = items.map(toName)
 *   .filter(isReady)
 *   .sort();
 * ```
