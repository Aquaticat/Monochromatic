# @monochromatic-dev/config-oxlint-no-restricted-syntax

Oxlint JS plugin implementing `no-restricted-syntax` rules
that oxlint does not support natively.

Oxlint lacks ESLint's `no-restricted-syntax` rule because it requires
a full AST selector engine.
This plugin provides individual rules for each banned syntax pattern instead.

## Rules

- **no-arrow-function**:
   bans arrow functions in favor of named function declarations/expressions
- **no-array-callback-reference**:
   bans direct callback references in array iterator methods while allowing explicit arity wrapper calls
- **no-class**:
   bans class declarations and expressions in favor of composition-oriented objects and functions
- **no-enum**:
   bans `enum` declarations in favor of union types with `as const`
- **no-for-in**:
   bans `for...in` loops in favor of `Object.entries`/`Object.keys`/`Object.values`
- **no-function-root-let**:
   bans `let` at function-body root unless the helper-shape exception applies
- **no-hasownproperty**:
   bans `.hasOwnProperty()` in favor of `Object.hasOwn()`
- **no-immediate-mutation**:
   bans immediate clone-then-mutate patterns when immutable construction is clearer
- **no-low-information-symbol-description**:
   requires static `Symbol('...')` descriptions to carry enough debugging information;
   rejects generic identifiers,
   absence labels,
   and repeated low-information phrases
- **catch-binding**:
   bans `catch {}`;
   bind the caught value with `catch (error) {}` or another named binding
- **no-module-root-let**:
   bans module-root `let` in favor of containers or memoization helpers
- **no-promise-catch**:
   bans `.catch()` chaining in favor of `try`/`catch` with `async`/`await`
- **no-promise-finally**:
   bans `.finally()` chaining in favor of `using`/`await using`
- **no-regex**:
   requires regex usage to be justified through a scoped `oxlint-disable` comment
- **no-rest-params**:
   bans rest parameters (`...args`) in favor of explicit array parameters
- **no-switch**:
   bans `switch` statements in favor of if/else chains or `Record` lookups
- **no-sync**:
   bans Node sync APIs while allowing non-Node `Sync`-named APIs
- **no-trim-left-right**:
   bans `.trimLeft()`/`.trimRight()` in favor of `.trimStart()`/`.trimEnd()`
- **no-try-finally**:
   bans `try...finally` blocks in favor of `using`/`await using`
- **no-nullish-union**:
   bans union types containing `null` or `undefined`
  (`T | null`,
   `T | undefined`).
   Ranked fixes are `foo?: T` for optional object properties or fields,
  local guard and early return,
   `nonNullishOrThrow`,
   a domain-specific `unique symbol` sentinel for the exact
  absence condition or distinct non-empty domain value,
   and a scoped disable for genuine external API mirrors.
- **no-optional-escape**:
   bans every other statically-detectable type-level fake-optional encoding (`| void`,
   `| never`,
   `| unknown`/`| any`,
   falsy literal members,
   `| {}`,
   empty/optional/rest-only tuples,
   `Partial<T>`,
   `Record<K, never>`,
   added-optionality mapped types)
- **no-variable-function-expression**:
   bans `const x = function() {}`,
   use a function declaration instead
- **prefer-describe-function-ref-name**:
   requires `describe({ name: fn.name })` when a test suite name mirrors an in-scope function binding
- **prefer-error-is-error**:
   bans legacy Error detection (`instanceof Error`,
   `Object.prototype.toString` tags,
   constructor comparisons,
   and Node `util.types.isNativeError()`),
   autofixing them to `Error.isError(value,)`
- **prefer-readonly-parameter-types**:
   requires honest deep-readonly contracts for nonmutating data,
   verifies `@mutates` against caller-observable effects,
   and fails closed at unresolved external boundaries
- **no-disable-prefer-readonly-parameter-types**:
   prohibits inline suppression of semantic readonly-effect checks
- **require-destructured-params**:
   function declarations with 2+ params must use a single destructured object
- **require-queryselector-generic**:
   requires explicit generic typing for querySelector-style calls

`no-regex` is enabled by the shared `@monochromatic-dev/config-oxlint` package.
Necessary regex sites must use scoped disable justifications.

## prefer-readonly-parameter-types

This project-owned replacement combines resolved TypeScript readonly semantics
with whole-project mutation summaries.
It uses TypeScript 7 through `typescript/unstable/sync` and therefore requires
a configured project containing each linted source file.
Oxlint CLI diagnostics are authoritative because Oxlint's language server does not run JavaScript plugins.

Nonmutating data parameters require an honest deep-readonly type.
Capability types may retain their original API when analysis proves no mutation path.
A readonly projection that retains audited mutation capabilities reports `dishonestReadonly`.
Unknown external calls report what input and calls are involved instead of being assumed safe.
Unknown method diagnostics explain that a method can change its object or controlled system without assigning a new
value to input binding.
Exact global `String(value)` analysis reads both declaration identity and argument type.
It accepts primitive unions,
`symbol`,
and type-branded primitives because those paths cannot expose caller-owned mutable state.
For object-capable values,
the diagnostic names getter and proxy property reads plus `Symbol.toPrimitive`,
`toString`,
and `valueOf` calls.
A TypeScript object type cannot prove those runtime hooks absent because a caller can supply accessors,
overrides,
or a proxy.
The diagnostic therefore enumerates narrowing,
primitive-field conversion,
noncoercing fallback,
removal,
and deliberate `@mutates` remedies.

Deliberate conversion of `unknown` remains expressible:

```typescript
/**
 * Converts caller value with deliberate coercion hooks.
 *
 * @param value - Caller value allowed to define conversion behavior.
 *
 * @returns caller-defined text conversion.
 *
 * @mutates value - String may invoke getters, proxy traps, Symbol.toPrimitive, toString, or valueOf on this input.
 */
function deliberatelyCoerce(value: unknown,): string {
  return String(value,);
}
```

The rule verifies that complete contract and propagates it as a mutation rather than reporting unresolved coercion.

Externally dictated mutable callback and API handles use project-owned `ForeignBorrowed<T>` marker at audited foreign
boundaries.
Marker records ownership rather than claiming readonly semantics:
direct mutation still requires `@mutates`,
and unresolved calls still report `opaqueEffect`.
Project-owned data contracts continue to require structural deep readonly.

Intentional mutation uses a repeatable project TSDoc block:

```typescript
/**
 * Clears shared traversal state before reuse.
 *
 * @param visited - Shared cycle detector retained across calls.
 *
 * @mutates visited - Clears caller-owned traversal state.
 */
function clearVisited(visited: Set<string>,): void {
  visited.clear();
}
```

The target must name a parameter or destructured parameter binding,
and the description must explain why mutation occurs.
The sibling `@monochromatic-dev/config-oxlint-tsdoc` plugin validates grammar;
both plugins consume the same shared parser.
The semantic rule reports missing and stale contracts,
propagates effects and opaque provenance through owned calls,
matches destructured mutation targets to packaged object-literal properties,
callback aliases,
and escaped closure containers,
and consumes bodyless source-signature contracts.
Declaration files remain exempt enforcement inputs.

An unknown call has distinct valid remediations,
and the diagnostic spells out all of them:

- remove or rewrite call;
- include repository-owned implementation in nearest TypeScript project;
- audit exact external function or method and add tested catalogue entry recording every changed receiver or argument;
- document every possible change with `@mutates` in current function or dedicated wrapper.

Every unknown call effect documented through `@mutates` must name upstream callable or link its contract.
Documented effect then propagates as mutation while retaining provenance for audit.
An unrelated tag or tag that leaves any affected input undocumented does not waive diagnostic.

Semantic rewrites are suggestions only.
Ordinary `--fix` does not change signatures or mutation contracts;
explicit `--fix-suggestions` may apply verified stale-contract removal,
a deep-safe `T[]` to `readonly T[]` rewrite,
or a capability-free structural projection through an existing named `type-fest` `ReadonlyDeep` import.
Inline suppression is prohibited by `no-disable-prefer-readonly-parameter-types`.

## no-nullish-union

`tsconfig` sets `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true`.
Widening a type to `T | undefined` skirts that setting instead of fixing the underlying problem;
it lets `undefined` flow into a typed position the optional-property machinery was meant to keep absent.
Pivoting the same slot to `T | null` is not a fix;
 it is the identical nullish escape with a different keyword.
The rule flags any `TSUnionType` with a `TSUndefinedKeyword` or `TSNullKeyword` member:
`T | undefined`,
 `undefined | T`,
 `T | null`,
 `null | T`,
 and either nullish keyword anywhere in a union,
including nested forms such as `Promise<T | null>` and `Array<T | undefined>`.

This rule owns only `null` and `undefined` union members.
The sibling `no-optional-escape` rule owns `| void`,
 tuple encodings,
 `Partial<T>`,
and related type-level fake-optionality escapes.
`TSNullKeyword` is the `null` type keyword,
 distinct from the `null` literal node `TSNullLiteral`.
A standalone `type X = undefined` or `type X = null` is not a union and is not flagged.

Take the first branch that fits:

1.   **Optional object property or field**:
     write `foo?: T`,
      never `foo?: T | undefined` and never `foo: T | undefined`.
     Under `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`,
      `?:` already means "absent or `T`";
     the `| undefined` adds nothing and reopens the hole the setting closes.
2.   **Presence establishable here**:
     guard with `if` and return early so the typed slot receives only `T`.
3.   **Absence should fail loud at this boundary**:
     throw via `nonNullishOrThrow` from `@monochromatic-dev/module-or-throw`.
4.   **Absence must travel onward as a real value**:
     mint a domain-specific `unique symbol` sentinel for this exact absence condition,
     or carry a distinct non-empty domain value when the domain has one.
     Sentinels are local to one semantic absence condition and should not be reused across unrelated conditions.
     Export the sentinel only when consumers must compare against values returned by that API.
     Consumers narrow symbols with `typeof value === 'symbol'` first,
     then identity (`value === KEY_NOT_FOUND`).
     This is the heaviest ordinary fix;
      reach for it last.
5.   **Genuine external API mirror**:
     use a scoped
     `oxlint-disable-next-line no-restricted-syntax/no-nullish-union -- <reason>`
     comment whose reason names the external API and why the mirror is unavoidable.

Never use `null`,
 `undefined`,
 empty string,
 zero,
 negative one,
 `false`,
 `void`,
 empty tuple,
empty object,
 or `Partial` as a stand-in for absent.
Empty arrays and `Option`/`Maybe`/`Result` wrappers are also not accepted absence modeling in this repo;
keep this diagnostic's canonical never-list aligned with `no-optional-escape`.

```typescript
// Bad
let cached: Provider | undefined;
let head: Node | null;
type Options = { existing?: ExistingNode | undefined; };
function find(): string | null {}

// Good
type Options = { existing?: ExistingNode; };

const value = lookup(key,);
if (value === undefined) {
  return;
}
// value is now `T`, never `T | undefined`

// Good; domain-specific Symbol sentinel instead of the union
const KEY_NOT_FOUND: unique symbol = Symbol('requested key not found in store',);
type Result = string | typeof KEY_NOT_FOUND;
```

## no-optional-escape

`exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true` keeps `undefined` out of typed slots.
Agents repeatedly invent new type-level encodings to dodge it:
 once `| undefined` and `| null` were banned,
 the next dodge was `| void`,
 then tuple-as-Maybe,
 then literal sentinels,
 then `Partial<T>`.
This rule enumerates and bans the whole statically-detectable space in one pass.
`| undefined` and `| null` stay with `no-nullish-union`;
 everything else lives here.

The fixes are the same four:
 `foo?: T` for an optional property;
 an `if`-guard so the value is always present where typed;
 throw via `nonNullishOrThrow` (`@monochromatic-dev/module-or-throw`);
 or a real sentinel (a unique `Symbol`,
 or a distinct non-empty domain value).
A genuine external-boundary mirror uses a scoped `oxlint-disable-next-line no-restricted-syntax/no-optional-escape` with a justification.

### Banned (each its own diagnostic)

Union members:

- `T | void`:
   `void` is assignable from `undefined`,
   so it widens the slot.
- `T | never`:
   collapses to `T`;
   a hand-written `| never` is a stubbed-out absence branch.
- `T | unknown` and `T | any`:
   collapse to the wide type,
   accepting everything including nullish.
- `T | {}`:
   an empty object type widens to any non-nullish value.
- Falsy literal members:
   the empty string `""`,
   an empty template literal type,
   zero `0`,
   a negative number such as `-1`,
   and `false`.
   Flagged only when the union also has a non-literal member,
   so a finite literal domain like `0 | 1 | 2` is left alone.

Tuples:

- Empty tuple `[]`.
- Optional element `[T?]`.
- Optional named member `[foo?: T]`.
- Rest-only tuple `[...T[]]` (functionally `T[]` dressed as 0-or-many).

Type references and mapped types:

- `Partial<T>` (makes every property optional).
- `Record<K, never>` and `Pick<T, never>` (produce an empty object).
- A mapped type that adds optionality,
   `{ [K in keyof T]?: ... }` (a hand-rolled `Partial`).

### Allowed (not flagged)

- A bare `(): void` return;
   only `void` inside a union is banned.
- `T | null` and `T | undefined`,
   owned by `no-nullish-union`.
- A fixed non-empty tuple `[number, string]`,
   and a leading-element variadic tuple `[T, ...U[]]` (one-or-more).
- A real `Symbol` sentinel via `typeof MY_SYMBOL`.
- A non-empty literal member (`T | 42`,
   `T | "pending"`) and pure literal domains (`0 | 1 | 2`,
   `"a" | "b"`).
- A real `Record<K, V>` or `Pick<T, K>`,
   and the `Required` mapped form `{ [K in keyof T]-?: ... }`.

### Statically undetectable (review-only blind spots)

A pattern is undetectable when the type annotation itself is honest and carries no syntactic marker of absence;
 there is nothing for an AST rule to see.

- A field typed `string` but defaulted to `""` at runtime:
   the type is `string`,
   an honest annotation.
- A `T[]` whose emptiness encodes absence:
   the type is `T[]`,
   honest.
- `0` or `-1` used as absent on a plain `number`:
   the type is `number`,
   honest.
   (Contrast `T | 0`,
   which is a literal-type union and is banned.
  )
- `T | typeof CONST` where `CONST` resolves to a falsy literal:
   the `typeof` node is identical whether `CONST` is a real `Symbol` or an empty string (verified by AST probe),
   so distinguishing it needs binding resolution.
   Reliable only for a same-file literal-initialized `const`;
   cross-file or imported `CONST` needs the type-checker the JS plugin lacks.
   Not implemented.
- `Omit<T, keyof T>` (equals `{}`):
   detectable in principle but needs a structural match between the `keyof T` argument and `T`;
   fragile,
   not implemented.
- `class Sentinel {}` plus `T | typeof Sentinel`:
   same blind spot as `typeof CONST`,
   and a class instance type is itself a distinct non-empty value,
   so it is an allowed sentinel anyway.
- `0n` (bigint zero) as a union literal:
   deliberately skipped;
   rare,
   and bigint literals add magic-literal friction for little gain.
- `NaN` as a union member is not expressible (`NaN` is a value,
   not a type),
   so there is nothing to detect.

## no-low-information-symbol-description

Sentinel `Symbol`s replace nullish unions across this codebase,
 so a Symbol's description is often the only debugging identity at a crash site.
This rule requires static descriptions to carry enough context.
It checks `Symbol('...')`,
 `Symbol.for('...')`,
 and zero-expression template literals.
Absent,
 dynamic,
 and non-string descriptions are skipped because an oxlint JS plugin has no type information;
 no-argument `Symbol()` is never reported.

The classifier is structural,
 not semantic.
It uses word count,
 distinct-word count,
 casing,
 namespace shape (`prefix/tail`,
 `prefix:tail`),
 meaningful-word repetition,
 and a small set of named grammar hooks (`no`,
 `not`,
 `because`,
 `ed`,
 `ing`).
It deliberately uses no Shannon entropy,
 no global compression,
 and no broad vocabulary lists.
A description passes when it carries a structural specificity marker (an uppercase letter,
 a digit,
 a dot,
 an underscore,
 or a consonant-dense token) or otherwise reads like a phrase rather than a bare identifier,
 even when short.

```ts
// Pass: enough context, even when short
Symbol('github token expired');
Symbol('file log.jsonl exists');
Symbol('penpot/figma-input-has-no-counterpart');
Symbol('average divisor is zero');

// Fail: too few words, all-caps constant, bare identifier, repetition, generic namespace tail
Symbol('meow');
Symbol('STATE IS UNKNOWN');
Symbol('runWithContext');
Symbol('file file exists');
Symbol('tsdoc/no-tag');
```

Dynamic and absent descriptions are skipped:

```ts
Symbol(buildId());            // skipped: not a static string
Symbol(`prefix-${dynamic}`);  // skipped: template literal with an expression
Symbol();                     // skipped: no description argument
```

Some descriptions are intentionally borderline and excluded from the calibration data,
 so they are labeled neither pass nor fail.
`no-static-method-name` and its uppercase variant are the current borderline rows.
If the rule reports a borderline-style description in real source,
 rewrite that Symbol description to carry more context rather than weakening the classifier.

The calibration data lives in `packages/test-fixture/oxlint-no-restricted-syntax/data/`.
A browser benchmark there (`no-low-information-symbol-description.benchmark.html`) compares this production classifier against threshold-only baselines (minimum length,
 distinct words,
 type-token ratio) over the labeled pass and fail rows.
The classifier reaches zero misclassifications where the threshold baselines do not.

## Ban-disable rules

The plugin also includes `no-disable-*` rules that block broad or stale disable comments.
Use a tightly-scoped `oxlint-disable-next-line` with a justification when a rule cannot be satisfied structurally.

## Usage

```typescript
// oxlint.config.ts
import { defineConfig, } from 'oxlint';
export default defineConfig({
  jsPlugins: ['@monochromatic-dev/config-oxlint-no-restricted-syntax',],
},);
```

The package default export resolves to the prebuilt,
 self-contained
`dist/final/node/index.mjs` (run `mise run //packages/oxlint-plugins/no-restricted-syntax:build`
first).
 TypeScript source is available at the `/ts` subpath (`/ts/*` for individual files)
for development.

## Tests

Fixture-based tests cover syntax rules,
ban-disable rules,
autofixes,
and symbol-description calibration data:

```bash
mise run buildAndTest -- packages/oxlint-plugins/no-restricted-syntax/src/oxlint-no-restricted-syntax.unit.test.ts
```

Test fixtures live in `packages/test-fixture/oxlint-no-restricted-syntax/src/`.
Symbol-description pass/fail/borderline rows live in
`packages/test-fixture/oxlint-no-restricted-syntax/data/`.
