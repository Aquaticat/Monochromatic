//! Observed-state output for the nested-Wayland boundary test.
//!
//! When `FM_STICKY_STATE_PATH` is set, the controller mirrors a shallow JSON snapshot into that
//! file after every model mutation and every scroll change, using the exact key set the Electron
//! prototype's main process writes (`activePath`, `columnCount`, `overlapCount`, `paneCount`,
//! `ready`, `rootPinned`, `scrolledDown`, `scrollTopPx`), so both apps' boundary tests share their
//! assertions. Writes are atomic (unique temp file plus rename) so a poller never reads a
//! truncated JSON document.

/// What: imports filesystem write/rename helpers.
/// Why: the state file is written to a unique temp path and renamed into place.
use std::fs;
/// What: imports the process-id accessor.
/// Why: the temp filename embeds the pid so concurrent apps never collide.
use std::process;
/// What: imports the wall-clock type used in the temp filename.
/// Why: a timestamp keeps successive temp names unique within one process.
use std::time::{SystemTime, UNIX_EPOCH};

/// What: imports the JSON object and value types.
/// Why: the snapshot is a shallow scalar object built explicitly (the `json!` macro expands to a
///      disallowed `unwrap`, so the map is assembled by hand).

/// Why: pinning and overlap facts are recomputed from placements plus scroll, never from widgets.
