//! Horizontal reveal helpers for `StripLayout`.
//!
//! Vertical movement belongs to lane groups (`layout/lane.rs`). This child module keeps the small
//! amount of remaining scroll work: reveal a newly spawned column horizontally, ask the lane module
//! to reveal the pane vertically, and expose the shared row-to-pixel helper.
