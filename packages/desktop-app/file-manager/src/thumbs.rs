//! Off-thread thumbnail decoding with a bounded, evicting texture cache.
//!
//! A dedicated worker thread decodes image files with the `image` crate (never on the render
//! path: synchronous per-frame decode collapses the frame rate), sending back raw RGBA pixels
//! over an async channel drained on the GTK main context. The main thread wraps the pixels in a
//! `MemoryTexture`, caches it, and fulfils every `Picture` that requested that path. The cache is a
//! least-recently-used map bounded by total bytes, so browsing many images keeps decoded memory
//! bounded and an evicted preview simply re-decodes on scroll-back.
