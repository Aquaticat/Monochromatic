//! File drag-and-drop wiring.

//! Inbound (OS file manager -> app) uses a native `GtkDropTarget` over `GdkFileList`, recovering
//! the path (on macOS GDK percent-encodes the URI scheme colon, so an unescape is needed). Outbound
//! (app -> OS file manager) is native on Wayland via `GtkDragSource`, but Windows and macOS need
//! native shims (`win_drag`, `mac_drag`) because their GDK backends do not deliver files to the OS
//! file manager; those are triggered from a `GtkGestureDrag`. See the `gtk4-*-file-drag` /
//! `gtk4-macos-file-dnd` troubleshooting docs.
