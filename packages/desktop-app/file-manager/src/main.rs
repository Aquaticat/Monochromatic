//! Binary entry point: a thin wrapper over the `file_manager` library `run`.

/// What: imports the library crate's `run` entry point.
/// Why: all startup and UI logic lives in the library so the domain modules unit-test without
///      the binary; the bin exists only to hand the process to `run`.

/// Why: keeps the binary minimal (the library owns startup); GTK's `ExitCode` propagates out.
