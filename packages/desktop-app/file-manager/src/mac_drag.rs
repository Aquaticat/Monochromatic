//! Native AppKit drag source for outbound file drag on macOS.
//!
//! GTK4's GDK macOS (Quartz) backend cannot hand a file out to Finder: a `GtkDragSource` that
//! offers a correct `text/uri-list` still bounces, because the backend never writes the file to
//! the `NSPasteboard` as an `NSURL`. Here we start a real AppKit dragging session from the GTK
//! window's `NSView`, with the file's `NSURL` as the pasteboard writer, so Finder accepts the
//! drop. Everything runs on the GTK main thread, which is also the AppKit main thread. Compiled
//! only on macOS. See doc/troubleshooting/gtk4-macos-file-dnd.md.
