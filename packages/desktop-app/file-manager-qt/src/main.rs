//! What: entry point; boots a QGuiApplication + QQmlApplicationEngine and loads the QML UI.
//! Why: cxx-qt requires a QGuiApplication before any QObject exists; the engine then loads
//!      the qrc-embedded QML, which instantiates the Rust `AppBridge` QObject. This minimal
//!      shell proves the Rust <-> Qt/QtQuick pipeline and a native Wayland window before the
//!      directory model and drag-and-drop handlers land.

/// What: the cxx-qt bridge module holding the app's root QObject.
/// Why: declared here (not a separate lib) because this is a binary crate; build.rs points
///      at the same file so the C++ shim is generated.

///      drains to stderr on a dedicated thread, so logging never blocks the UI/render
///      thread. The returned guard must outlive all logging: dropping it flushes buffered
///      lines and stops the worker. RUST_LOG overrides the default `info` filter.
