/**
 * Builds a {@link WatchFilter} that suppresses byte-identical writes.
 *
 * The filter consults `ctx.hashCache` (shared with the watcher; pre-populated
 * during the initial walk) and hashes the event's file on each post-`ready`
 * event:
 *
 * - `unlink`: passes through (`true`); there is no content to compare and
 *   the watcher already cleared the cache entry, so the decision to fire
 *   belongs to other filters (e.g. `--events`).
 * - `add` / `change`: hashes the file. Same hash as the stored value → skip
 *   (`false`). Different hash or no stored hash → store the new hash and
 *   fire (`true`).
 * - File exceeds `hashCache.maxHashSize` ({@link HashCache.hashFile} returns
 *   `null`): returns `true` (fire-without-comparing) so a multi-GB file does
 *   not block the dev loop on a slow read.
 * - Read error (e.g. ENOENT when the file vanishes between event dispatch
 *   and read): logs a warning and returns `true`; a transient race must
 *   not silently drop a real change.
 *
 * The cache is owned by {@link startWatchRestart} and lives on {@link WatchCtx};
 * keeping it off the filter's closure means a single shared cache flows
 * from the watcher's pre-populate phase straight through to the live
 * compare phase without a second copy.
 *
 * @returns watch filter that returns `false` for byte-identical writes
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const filter = contentHashFilter();
 * const passed = await filter({ event, ctx, },);
 * ```
