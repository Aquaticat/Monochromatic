# @monochromatic-dev/dev-script-task-util

CLI utilities for mise task orchestration:
 a command executor with `allowFailure` support,
a file append helper,
 a make-style dependency checker,
a `tsc` wrapper that filters `node_modules` diagnostics,
and an `oxlint` wrapper that augments diagnostics while preserving every finding and exit status.

## Binaries

### task-command

Wraps command execution to work around task runner limitations where tasks with
`allowFailure: true` can't be dependencies.
 Controls exit codes while preserving
all output and errors.

```sh
# Exit with the command's exit code
task-command -- oxlint

# Always exit with 0 regardless of command result
task-command --allowFailure -- oxlint
task-command -a -- oxlint

# Execute through the shell (enables pipes, &&, etc.)
task-command --shell -- "echo hello && echo world"
task-command -s -- "echo hello && echo world"

# Set a timeout in milliseconds
task-command --timeout 5000 -- npm test
task-command -t 5000 -- npm test

# Combine flags
task-command -a -s -- "oxlint && dprint check"
```

The `--` separator is required to distinguish script flags from command arguments.

### task-append

Appends text lines to a file.
 Validates that the target file exists and has write
permissions before appending.

```sh
# Append a single line
task-append "new line" --to output.md

# Append multiple lines as separate arguments
task-append "line 1" "line 2" "line 3" --to output.md

# Short flag
task-append "new line" -t output.md
```

### task-depends

Make-style dependency checker that replaces mise's built-in `depends`.
Runs the command only when dependencies are stale,
 and collapses command output
(hidden on success,
 shown on failure).

Both `-s` and `-o` accept file globs or `sh:` prefixed shell commands.
`sh:` commands must output a parseable timestamp on stdout
(`Infinity`,
 `-Infinity`,
 unix epoch,
 or ISO 8601).
Non-zero exit codes are errors,
 not silent staleness signals.

```sh
# File-based: run build only when sources changed
task-depends -s "src/**/*.ts" -o "dist/**/*.js" -- mise run build

# Command-based gate: rebuild container only when image is missing
task-depends -s "sh:echo Infinity" -o "sh:podman image exists img && echo Infinity || echo -Infinity" -- podman build .

# Timestamp from command: use git commit time as source mtime
task-depends -s "sh:git log -1 --format=%ct" -o "dist/**" -- mise run build

# Catch missing outputs in mixed lists with oldest strategy
task-depends --output-time-strategy oldest -s "src/**" -o "dist/**" -o "sh:curl -sf localhost/health && echo Infinity || echo -Infinity" -- mise run deploy

# With verbose logging
task-depends -v -s "src/**" -o "dist/**" -- mise run build

# Allow command failure
task-depends -a -s "src/**" -o "dist/**" -- mise run build
```

### task-tsc

Wrapper for `tsc` that cleans stale incremental caches and
filters out diagnostics originating from `node_modules/` paths.

**Incremental cache cleanup.
**
The shared tsconfig sets `composite: true`,
 which implies `incremental: true`.
This is intentional;
 `composite` provides valuable constraints
(rootDir defaults to the tsconfig directory,
 all source files must be matched by `include`,
and `declaration` defaults to true).
However,
 tsc's `--build` mode has a cache invalidation bug
([#2666](https://github.com/nicolo-ribaudo/tc39-proposal-structs/issues/2666))
where stale `.tsbuildinfo` files cause false negatives after dependency updates.
To work around this,
 `task-tsc` deletes all `dist/**/*.tsbuildinfo` files
before each invocation,
 forcing a clean check every time.

**`node_modules` diagnostic filtering.
**
JSR packages ship `.ts` source files instead of `.d.ts` declarations.
TypeScript's resolver prefers `.ts` siblings over `.js` exports,
and `skipLibCheck` only covers `.d.ts` files.
This causes `tsc --build` to type-check JSR package source
under the consumer's tsconfig,
 producing false positives
(e.g. `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` violations in `@jsr/zod__zod`).
The wrapper drops diagnostic lines whose file path contains `/node_modules/`
along with their continuation lines (indented context lines),
and exits 0 when only `node_modules` errors were found.

```sh
# Default: runs tsc --build with filtering
task-tsc --build

# Forward any tsc arguments
task-tsc --build --noEmit
task-tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json

# Without arguments, defaults to --build
task-tsc
```

**`TSC_SINGLE_THREADED` requests TypeScript single-threaded mode.
**
When set to a truthy value,
the wrapper injects `--singleThreaded` unless the caller already passed it.
The root `mise run lint` fanout sets this env var beside `OXLINT_THREADS`,
so package-local `lint:types` tasks do not stack TypeScript 7 worker pools on top
of mise's package-level parallelism.
Values `0`,
`false`,
`no`,
and `off` opt out.

See `TROUBLESHOOTING.typescript.md` section
"JSR packages ship `.ts` source files that `skipLibCheck` cannot skip"
for the full root cause analysis.

### task-oxlint

Wrapper for `oxlint` that augments diagnostics with extra guidance
from `oxlint-augment.ts`.
The repository runs lint through this wrapper,
so the mise `lint:oxlint` task is the consumer boundary that matters.
The wrapper never removes diagnostics or converts Oxlint failures to success.

```sh
# Type-aware lint (what the mise lint:oxlint task runs)
task-oxlint --type-aware

# Auto-fix
task-oxlint --fix

# Any oxlint arguments are forwarded
task-oxlint --type-aware src/
```

Several behaviors differ from invoking `oxlint` directly.
 They are intentional;
this list exists so they are not mistaken for bugs.

**Forces `--format=default`.
**
The wrapper prepends `--format=default` unless the caller passes an explicit
`--format` or `-f`.
Oxlint's piped default reporter is not stable across versions.
The guidance injector needs graphical diagnostic boundaries to place notes beside their matching findings.
Consequently,
`task-oxlint` uses the graphical reporter even when piped,
while an explicit format always wins.
Non-graphical formats may not receive added guidance,
but their diagnostics and exit status still pass through unchanged.

**`OXLINT_THREADS` overrides thread count.
**
When set,
 the wrapper injects `--threads <value>`.
 oxlint ignores
`RAYON_NUM_THREADS`,
 so this env var is the only way to pin threads without
editing every call site.

## Why task-depends over mise native `depends`

Mise's built-in `depends` has three problems that make it unsuitable for
environment prerequisites like container image builds.

**`depends` always re-runs.
**
Mise's `depends` field unconditionally re-executes every listed task on every invocation.
A `podman build` that takes 30 seconds runs before every test,
 even when the image already exists.
Mise does offer `sources`/`outputs` for staleness checking,
 but these only work with files;
they cannot check whether a container image,
 a system package,
 or a running service exists.

**`sources`/`outputs` is file-only.
**
Mise's staleness detection compares file modification times and metadata hashes.
This works for source-to-artifact builds but cannot express conditions like
"does this container image exist" (`podman image exists`) or
"is this service healthy" (`curl --fail http://localhost:8080/health`).
`task-depends` accepts `sh:` prefixed shell commands in both `-s` and `-o`.
Commands must output a parseable timestamp (`Infinity`,
 `-Infinity`,
unix epoch seconds/ms,
 or ISO 8601).
 Non-zero exit codes are treated as errors,
preventing silent misinterpretation when commands fail unexpectedly.

**`depends` output is noisy.
**
When a depended-on task runs,
 its full stdout/stderr streams into the parent task's output.
For long-running builds this drowns out the actual task output.
`task-depends` captures the command's output and only shows it when the command fails,
keeping the happy path clean.

### Staleness model

Everything resolves to timestamps.
 Stale when `strategy(sources) > strategy(outputs)`.

**File globs** resolve to file modification times.
Empty globs contribute no timestamps;
 the aggregation strategy returns `-Infinity`
("no information"),
 which means empty sources never trigger and empty outputs always trigger.

**`sh:` commands** must output a parseable timestamp on stdout:

- `Infinity` or `-Infinity` (gate pattern:
   exists/missing)
- Unix epoch seconds or milliseconds
- ISO 8601 date string

Non-zero exit codes throw an error.
 To handle command failures gracefully,
use the shell gate pattern:
 `sh:command && echo Infinity || echo -Infinity`.

**Aggregation strategies** reduce multiple timestamps per side to one value:

- `newest` (default):
   `Math.max`;
   any new source or any fresh output dominates
- `oldest`:
   `Math.min`;
   catches the oldest/missing item in mixed lists
- `mean`:
   arithmetic mean of all timestamps
- `median`:
   middle value,
   robust to outliers
- `sh:command`:
   custom shell command that receives millisecond timestamps
  on stdin (one per line) and must output a single millisecond timestamp,
  `Infinity`,
   or `-Infinity`

```sh
# Custom strategy using Unix sort (minimum = oldest)
task-depends --output-time-strategy "sh:sort -n | head -1" -s "src/**" -o "dist/**" -- mise run build

# Custom strategy using awk for weighted average
task-depends --source-time-strategy "sh:awk '{s+=$1;n++} END{print s/n}'" -s "src/**" -o "dist/**" -- mise run build
```

Commands run via `/bin/sh` (Node.
js `child_process` with `shell: true`).
