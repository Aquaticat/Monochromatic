# @monochromatic-dev/dev-script-catalog-tighten.matrix

Containerised end-to-end matrix for `catalog-tighten`. A sidecar of
`packages/dev-script/catalog-tighten`, it proves the tool resolves the active
installed version and tightens the catalog floor correctly across every pnpm
install layout, in isolated containers.

## What it covers

Each scenario installs a tiny fixture workspace (two consumer packages, both
depending on a pinned `picomatch`) under one pnpm layout, applies an optional
post-install mutation, then asserts the tool tightens `picomatch` from `>=4.0.0`
to `>=4.0.2`, reports a MISS or an UNDCL, or fails cleanly.

Layout and settings (expect tighten):

- `nodeLinker: isolated`, hoist on and off.
- `nodeLinker: hoisted`, hoist on and off.
- `nodeLinker: pnp` (pnpm's pnp is a hybrid that keeps per-importer `node_modules` symlinks).
- `nodeLinker: pnp` with `symlink: false` (pnpm's recommended pnp config): a true no-`node_modules`
  layout, resolved through `.pnp.cjs`; this is the case that exercises the PnP reader.
- `modulesDir` renamed, `virtualStoreDir` relocated, `enableGlobalVirtualStore`, `storeDir` relocated.
- Stale orphan: a higher `picomatch@4.0.4` is seeded into the virtual store with
  no symlink; the tool must tighten to the active `4.0.2`, never the orphan. This
  is the regression proving the old store-scan removal was correct
  (see `docs/troubleshooting/pnpm-modules-cache.md`).

Missing-X robustness:

- Missing lockfile, missing store, missing some `node_modules` (one consumer),
  missing pnpm (`pnpm config get` unavailable), and missing `.pnp.cjs` under the default pnp linker
  (its symlinks survive): still tighten, because resolution reads on-disk state.
- Missing virtual store (`node_modules/.pnpm` deleted, symlinks left dangling): MISS. Missing
  `.pnp.cjs` under `symlink: false` (no symlinks left to fall back on): MISS.
- Store-only (both consumers' `node_modules` removed, root `.pnpm` kept): UNDCL, because the package
  is present in the store as a transitive-style copy but no importer declares it directly.
- Missing all `node_modules`, missing `pnpm-workspace.yaml`: fail cleanly with a clear error.

## How it runs

`test:matrix` runs the orchestrator, which for each combination launches a
podman container:

- The monorepo is bind-mounted read-only at `/repo`, so catalog-tighten and its
  `yaml` dependency resolve through the mounted symlinks without a build.
- The fixture is written and installed in a writable tmpfs at `/work`.
- pnpm is provisioned by corepack at the pinned version; the rootfs is
  read-only and caches go to tmpfs.
- Per-container memory, cpu, and pid caps bound resource use.

Network is required (the fixture install pulls from the registry), so this is
not part of the standard `test:unit` run.

## Usage

```sh
# Run the full container matrix (needs podman + network)
mise run //packages/dev-script/catalog-tighten.matrix:test:matrix

# Fast host-only unit tests for the fixture builder
mise run //packages/dev-script/catalog-tighten.matrix:test:unit
```

## Layout

- `src/combos.ts`: the combinations and the fixture file content (pure, unit-tested).
- `src/in-container.ts`: the per-combination entrypoint that runs inside a container.
- `src/matrix.unit.matrix.test.ts`: the orchestrator that launches one container per combination.
