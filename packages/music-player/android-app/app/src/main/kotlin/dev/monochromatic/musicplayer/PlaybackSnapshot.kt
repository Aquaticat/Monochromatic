// File summary (folding in the old KDoc domain content):
// This file defines two plain "record"-style data containers used by the
// Android music player. They carry a frozen, point-in-time copy of what the
// player is doing right now, so the Android system UI (the notification and
// the lock-screen media controls, driven by a `MediaSession`) can be drawn
// without reaching back into the live player on every animation frame.
//   - `SnapshotItem`  = one track in the current playback scope (one row of
//                       the timeline the system shows).
//   - `PlaybackSnapshot` = the whole frozen view: the ordered track list plus
//                       the transport state (playing/paused, volume, position,
//                       duration). It is read fresh on each `getState()` pull;
//                       position/duration are sampled once here and the
//                       `MediaSession` extrapolates them between pulls, so the
//                       snapshot is NOT rebuilt every frame.
// Both classes are immutable value bags: build one, read it, throw it away.

// What:     `package dev.monochromatic.musicplayer` declares which "folder of
//           names" every type in this file belongs to. `package` is Kotlin's
//           keyword for a namespace; the dotted path
//           `dev.monochromatic.musicplayer` is that namespace's full name.
//           Other files in the same package can refer to `SnapshotItem` and
//           `PlaybackSnapshot` without importing them.
// Why:      We need it so these classes share an identity with the rest of the
//           app's code (`PlayerController`, `BrainPlayer`, `PlaybackService`,
//           …) and so the build tool knows where this file's types live.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// // No 1:1 equivalent — the folder path dev/monochromatic/musicplayer
// // IS the namespace; TS files just export and import by relative path.
// ```
package dev.monochromatic.musicplayer

// What:     `data class SnapshotItem( ... )` declares a class named
//           `SnapshotItem`. The `data` modifier tells Kotlin "this is a value
//           record": the compiler auto-generates structural `equals`/`hashCode`
//           (two items with the same field values count as equal), a readable
//           `toString`, and a `copy(...)` method. The `( ... )` right after the
//           name is the PRIMARY CONSTRUCTOR: the parameters listed inside it
//           both define the constructor arguments AND, because each is marked
//           `val`, become read-only public fields of the class.
// Why:      We need one of these per track so a `PlaybackSnapshot` can hold an
//           ordered list of them; this is the unit the system timeline shows.
// Gotcha:   "value equality" is the trap for a TS reader: two distinct
//           `SnapshotItem` objects with identical fields are `==`/`equals` in
//           Kotlin. In TS `{a:1} !== {a:1}`. Don't assume reference identity.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// type SnapshotItem = {
//   uri: string;
//   title: string;
//   loadIndex: number;
// };
// // Note: TS objects compare by reference; Kotlin `data class` compares by value.
// ```

data class SnapshotItem(
    // What:     `val uri: String`. `val` means "read-only binding" (assign

    //           text buffer). We picked plain `String`, the simplest, because
    //           the value never changes and is just handed around.
    // Why:      Holds the `content://` or `file://` URI the playback engine
    //           opens to actually read this track's bytes.

    //           `loadIndex`. `Int` is Kotlin's 32-bit signed integer (range
    //           roughly ±2.1 billion). Siblings the reader might expect:
    //           `Long` (64-bit signed integer), `Short` (16-bit), `Byte`
    //           (8-bit), and the unsigned variants `UInt`/`ULong`. We picked
    //           `Int` (not `Long`) because a load-order position over a
    //           folder of tracks fits easily in 32 bits, and `Int` is the
    //           default integer the Android/Kotlin APIs expect for indices.
    // Why:      The stable load-order index of this track. It doubles as the
    //           timeline-window uid, so the UI can map the system's "current
    //           media item" back to the row it came from.
    // Gotcha:   `Int` is NOT TS's `number`. It is a fixed-width 32-bit signed
    //           integer; arithmetic wraps around on overflow rather than
    //           silently widening, and there is no fractional part.

//           value record (same `data class` machinery as `SnapshotItem`:
//           auto value-equality, `toString`, `copy`). Its primary constructor
//           `( ... )` lists six `val` fields that together form one frozen
//           view of the player.
// Why:      We need a single object the player can build on demand and hand to
//           the `MediaSession`/`BrainPlayer` projection, so the Android system
//           UI can be drawn from a stable copy instead of querying the live,
//           constantly-changing player.
// Gotcha:   Same value-vs-reference trap as `SnapshotItem`: two snapshots with
//           identical contents are `equals` in Kotlin but `!==` in TS.

    //           `MutableList<SnapshotItem>` (a list you can add to / remove
    //           from) and `Array<SnapshotItem>` (a fixed-size primitive array).
    //           We picked the read-only `List` because a snapshot is frozen:

    //           is `Int?` — the trailing `?` makes it a NULLABLE `Int`, meaning
    //           the value is either a 32-bit signed integer or the special
    //           value `null`. Without the `?`, a Kotlin `Int` can never be
    //           null. Sibling to `Int` here is the non-nullable `Int` (and the
    //           wider `Long?`); we want the nullable form specifically so
    //           "no current track" is representable.
    // Why:      The position within `items` of the currently playing track, or
    //           `null` when the queue is empty and nothing is selected.
    // Gotcha:   `Int?` is enforced by the compiler: you cannot read it as a
    //           plain `Int` without first handling the null case (with `?.`,
    //           `?:`, or `!!`). TS's `strictNullChecks` is the analogue, but

    //           possible type.
    // Why:      The play INTENT, not the actual sound: `true` while playing or
    //           buffering, `false` only when paused. The session reports this
    //           so the notification's play/pause icon does not flicker while a
    //           track is still buffering (distinct from whether audio is
    //           literally coming out of the speaker right now).

    //           `Float` is Kotlin's 32-bit single-precision floating-point
    //           number. The sibling the reader might expect is `Double`, the
    //           64-bit double-precision float (which is what JS/TS `number`
    //           actually is). We picked `Float` (not `Double`) because Android
    //           audio gain APIs take 32-bit floats, so matching the type avoids
    //           a needless widen/narrow at the boundary.
    // Why:      Holds the output gain in the range `0.0..1.0` (silent to full).
    // Gotcha:   `Float` is LESS precise than TS's `number`. A literal like
    //           `0.1f` cannot represent the exact decimal; expect tiny rounding
    //           differences if you compare a `Float` against a TS `number`.

    //           `Int` (32-bit) and `Short`/`Byte` (narrower). We picked `Long`
    //           (not `Int`) because Android's media APIs express times in
    //           milliseconds as 64-bit values; a 32-bit `Int` of milliseconds
    //           would overflow after only ~24.8 days, so `Long` is the safe,
    //           API-matching choice.
    // Why:      Holds the current track's total duration in milliseconds, or
    //           `0` when the duration is not yet known (still being probed).
    // Gotcha:   A `Long` can hold integers larger than TS `number` can
    //           represent exactly (beyond 2^53). For millisecond durations this
    //           never matters, but don't assume every `Long` round-trips
