// File summary (folds in the old comment's domain content)
// =============================================================================
//
// `NativeBridge` is the app's thin Kotlin FACADE over the native engine shared library
// (`.so`, built from Rust via cargo-ndk). Every function here is `external`: it has NO
// Kotlin body; its implementation lives in the native library and is linked at load through
// JNI (Java Native Interface, the bridge between JVM code and native code).
//
// Two groups of functions are declared:
//   - SMOKE-TEST probes that proved the cargo-ndk -> JNI toolchain on device: `nativePing`,
//     `nativeOpusSelfTest`, `nativeSymphoniaSelfTest`, the decode benchmarks, and
//     `nativeOutputLatencyProbe`.
//   - the REAL engine surface the `RustEngine` drives: `nativeMeasureTruePeak` plus the
//     `nativeEngine*` create/load/transport/query/release calls.
//
// `handle: Long` everywhere is an OPAQUE native engine pointer (a 64-bit address the Rust
// side owns); `fd: Int` is a borrowed file descriptor. The JVM never dereferences either; it
// just passes them back to the native side. Integer return codes follow the convention `0` =
// success, negative = error.

// What:     `object NativeBridge { ... }` declares a SINGLETON OBJECT named `NativeBridge`:
//           Kotlin creates exactly one instance, with no constructor to call. Members are
//           reached as `NativeBridge.nativePing()`, like static methods on a namespace.
// Why:      The native bridge is global, stateless glue (the engine state lives behind the
//           native `handle`, not in this object); a singleton `object` is Kotlin's "static
//           namespace" with one shared instance.
// Gotcha:   `object X { }` here is a TYPE DECLARATION creating one global instance, not the
//           `object : Interface { }` expression used elsewhere for anonymous instances.
//
// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
// ```ts
// export const NativeBridge = {
//   // ...native function declarations as members...
// };
// ```

    // What:     `external fun nativeEngineRelease(handle: Long)` is a JNI native function taking the
    //           `handle` and returning `Unit` (void).
    // Why:      Release the native engine (stop its worker thread, free its resources); after this
    //           the handle is invalid and must not be reused.
    // Gotcha:   After `nativeEngineRelease`, the `handle` is dangling; the Kotlin side sets its
    //           stored handle to `0` so later calls are guarded.
    //
    // In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
    // ```ts
    // declare function nativeEngineRelease(handle: bigint): void; // handle invalid afterward
    // ```
