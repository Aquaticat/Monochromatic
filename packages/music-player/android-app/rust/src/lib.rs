//! Native bridge for the full-Rust engine flavor.
//!
//! JNI entry points plus the ported decode path (symphonia + libopus). The
//! self-tests prove the toolchain and decoders cross-compile and run on the
//! GrapheneOS device; `nativeDecodeBenchmark` times native decode-to-PCM so it
//! can be compared head to head against the Media3 MediaCodec baseline.
//!
//! Dum-dum orientation for a TypeScript reader: "JNI" (Java Native Interface) is
//! the bridge that lets Android's Kotlin/Java code call into compiled native code
//! (this Rust, built into a `.so` shared library) and get values back. Every
//! `pub extern "system" fn Java_dev_monochromatic_..._native...` function below is
//! one callable slot on the Kotlin `NativeBridge` class: the long mangled name IS
//! the wiring (package path + class + method, joined by underscores), so Kotlin's
//! `external fun nativePing(): Int` finds this `..._nativePing` by name at runtime.
//! Mentally, picture this whole file as a set of exported functions in a `.node`
//! native addon that a TS file imports and calls; the parameter and return types
//! are deliberately limited to the handful the JVM understands (`jint`, `jlong`,
//! `jdouble`, `jfloat`, `jboolean`, `JString`), which are just the platform's

/// What:     `mod decode;` declares a child module named `decode` and tells the

///           and `truepeak.rs`.
/// Why:      This file (the crate root) is the only place that lists the crate's

    //           This rebuilds a usable reference from the opaque handle. Reading it
    //           inside-out: `handle as *mut engine::Engine` casts the 64-bit int back
    //           to a raw MUTABLE pointer to an `Engine`. `*(...)` DEREFERENCES that raw
    //           pointer (follows it to the actual `Engine` in heap memory). `&mut ...`
    //           takes a MUTABLE BORROW of that `Engine` (we will call `&mut self`
    //           methods). The whole thing sits in an `unsafe { ... }` block: a region
    //           where the compiler trusts US to guarantee the pointer is valid, since
    //           it cannot prove it (raw-pointer deref is unchecked).
    // Why:      The engine lives behind a numeric handle; to call its methods we must
    //           turn that number back into a borrow of the real `Engine`.
    // Gotcha:   `unsafe` here is a PROMISE, not a bypass: if `handle` is stale or
    //           released, this is undefined behaviour. The safety contract (one valid
    //           handle, used from one thread) is enforced by Kotlin, not the compiler.
    //
    // In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
    // ```ts
    // const engineRef = handleTable.get(handle); // assume valid; no compiler check
    // ```
    let engine_ref = unsafe { &mut *(handle as *mut engine::Engine) };
    // What:     `match engine_ref.load(fd as RawFd, play != 0) { ... }`. We call the
    //           engine's `load` method. `fd as RawFd` casts the JVM int to the fd
    //           alias. `play != 0` converts the `jboolean` byte into a real Rust `bool`
    //           (any non-zero byte becomes `true`). `load` returns `Result<(),
    //           PlayerError>` (success carries the empty tuple `()` = "nothing"). The
    //           `match` is the tail expression, so its value is returned.
    // Why:      Hand the fd and play-intent to the engine and translate its result into
    //           the integer code contract.

        //           payload"). The arm yields `0`, the success code.
        // Why:      Load dispatched successfully; report 0.
        // Gotcha:   `()` is the unit value ("nothing"), not a typo; it is what a

    //           because rebuilding a box from a raw pointer is unchecked.

    //           dropping it is what actually tears the engine down.

    //           twice is a double-free (use-after-free); never calling it leaks the
