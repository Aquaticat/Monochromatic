//! The engine worker thread and the AAudio realtime callback. The worker owns the
//! decode `Source`, the SPSC ring producer, and the AAudio stream, and is the only
//! thread that touches them; the callback (on AAudio's realtime thread) owns the
//! ring consumer and only pops/gates/advances. Load and seek both rebuild the
//! output through `reconfigure_output`, which is how the ring is flushed (the
//! desktop engine's mechanism).
//!
//! Mental model for a TypeScript reader: this is the audio side of an Android music
//! player written in Rust. AAudio is Android's native low-latency audio output API
//! (the counterpart to cpal/CoreAudio/WASAPI on desktop). "SPSC ring" is a
//! single-producer/single-consumer ring buffer: a fixed-size lock-free queue split
//! into a WRITE end (the producer, on this worker thread) and a READ end (the
//! consumer, on AAudio's realtime thread). The worker decodes audio in chunks and
//! pushes samples into the WRITE end; AAudio calls our callback on a realtime thread
//! whenever the speakers need more samples, and that callback pops from the READ end.
//! Because the two ends live on different threads, the queue is the only thing they
//! share, and it needs no lock.
//!
//! Realtime-thread rule (the reason the code is shaped this way): the AAudio callback
//! runs on a hard-realtime thread, so it must NEVER allocate memory, take a lock, or
//! block. All of those can stall and cause an audible glitch. That is why decoding
//! (which allocates) happens on this worker thread, and the callback only pops, scales
//! samples, and writes into a buffer AAudio handed it.
