//! The frontier-zoom probe: measure a sparse even pass, then climb every heard hill.

//! A probe's under-read is set by how many short windows anywhere in the track come
//! near its crest; most misses land on the shoulder of a loud passage. The climb turns
//! every measured loud window into a path: repeatedly measure the windows on either
//! side of the loudest window measured so far, until the track's bin budget is spent.
//! Optional bones seeds (byte-rate hot slots from a lossless file's framing) start the
//! climb on the right hills at a fraction of the coverage.
