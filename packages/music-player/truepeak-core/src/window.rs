//! Even window placement across a long track, in interleaved frames.
//!
//! For a track longer than the policy threshold, the policy probes a few short windows
//! instead of decoding the whole file. The windows are spread evenly from the very
//! beginning to the final legal start (`total_frames - window_frames`), so the last
//! window covers the ending: a placement that misses the final start can under-read a
//! track that peaks near its end. Each window is measured with its own meter so the
//! discontinuity between two non-adjacent windows cannot fabricate an inter-sample
//! spike at the seam. This module is pure frame arithmetic; driving the source lives
//! in the service.

/// What:     `pub fn window_frames(window_seconds: f64, rate: u32) -> u64`. The number
///           of per-channel frames in one probe window: `floor(window_seconds * rate)`,
///           never below 1. `u64` (sibling `usize` is platform-width) is explicit and
///           wide enough for any window.
/// Why:      Window placement and the meter both need the window length in frames; the
///           floor-then-clamp keeps a tiny window or a tiny rate from yielding zero.

    //           down to a whole frame count, still as `f64`.
