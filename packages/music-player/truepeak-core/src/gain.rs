//! Attenuate-only normalization gain and the dB helpers around it.

//! Production playback multiplies every sample by one constant gain that brings the
//! track's measured true peak down to a -1 dBTP ceiling and never amplifies. That gain
//! is `normalization_gain`, kept in linear `f32` to match the meter and the audio
//! output. The dB helpers (`peak_dbtp`, `probe_estimated_peak`) are `f64` because the
//! classifier and bench reason in decibels, where the plan's gain-error bounds live.

/// What:     `pub const CEILING: f32 = 0.891_250_9;`. The true-peak target as a linear
///           amplitude: 10^(-1/20), i.e. -1 dBTP, written at the precision an `f32`
///           actually represents (the `_` digit separators are ignored; sibling `f64`
///           is used by the dB helpers, `f32` here matches the meter's sample type).
///           This is the same value the desktop crate's `CEILING` already uses, so the
///           shared gain is identical to what desktop shipped.
/// Why:      The level every track's true peak is normalized down to; -1 dBTP is the
///           EBU R128 / ATSC A/85 ceiling that leaves room for DAC reconstruction.
