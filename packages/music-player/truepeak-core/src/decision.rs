//! The gain decision a resolve produces, and the kinds of decision.
//!
//! A decision is the shared service's answer for one track: the constant linear gain to
//! apply, how it was reached (a short full scan, a proportional probe with margin, or a
//! full exact scan), the peak it was based on, and the track length. The cache stores
//! these; playback applies the `gain`.

/// What:     `#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq, Eq)] pub enum DecisionKind`. The
///           three ways the policy reaches a gain. `Eq` is valid because the variants
///           are plain tags. Sibling shape: a bool "exact or not"; an enum keeps the
///           three cases distinct for the cache and for debugging.
/// Why:      A reader (and the cache) must tell an exact decision from a probe estimate,
///           since only probe estimates carry the margin and can be improved by warming.

/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// type DecisionKind = "shortFullScan" | "probeEstimate" | "fullScanExact";
