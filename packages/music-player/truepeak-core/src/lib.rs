//! Shared true-peak core for the desktop and Android music players.
//!
//! "True peak" (a.k.a. inter-sample peak) is the highest level the analog waveform
//! reaches AFTER a DAC reconstructs it between the stored samples; it can sit above
//! the largest stored sample. This crate estimates it by oversampling each channel
//! ~4x with a cubic (Catmull-Rom) interpolation and taking the largest magnitude
//! seen, then turns that estimate into one constant per-track gain that brings the
//! track down to a -1 dBTP ceiling (never up), so playback cannot overflow the
//! converter.
//!
//! Both flavors used to carry their own copy of this logic, with the Android copy
//! adding an older windowing policy and a `1.26` safety factor that this crate does
//! NOT ship. The crate owns the meter, the gain math, the decoded-audio source
//! contract, the window-placement math, and the versioned policy identity that keys
//! the persistent decision cache. Platform crates supply decoded audio through
//! [`TruePeakSource`] and drive the policy; the measurement and gain rules live here.
//!
//! The classifier, the Turso cache I/O, and the warming engine described in the plan
//! land in later stages on top of this foundation.
