//! Probe inputs from the file itself: provenance and bones without platform tag readers.
//!
//! The bucket policy needs two zero-cost inputs per track: its provenance (which bucket)
//! and, for lossless files, the frame-size bones seeds. Sniffing a FLAC container and
//! walking its framing is file-format knowledge, not platform knowledge, so it lives
//! here; platforms hand over a path or the raw bytes and get the resolver's inputs back.
//! Degradation contract: any read or parse failure yields the uninformed provenance
//! (the bare bucket, the deepest coverage) with no bones, so a failure can only make the
//! probe more thorough, never less safe. Store and youtube provenance need real tag
//! readers, which stay platform-side; platforms that have them set the flags themselves.
