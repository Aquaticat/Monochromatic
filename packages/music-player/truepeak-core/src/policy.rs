//! The versioned policy and the identity tuple that keys cache rows.
//!
//! The app ships ONE active policy. A cached decision is reusable only when the full
//! identity matches: the `policy_id` (constants, gain math, cache
//! interpretation), the `meter_id` (Catmull-Rom behavior including the chunk-seam and
//! end-of-track rules), the `decoder_stack_id` (the platform's Symphonia and libopus
//! behavior, supplied by the platform), and the `schema_version` (row layout). Keeping
//! these as separate values, not collapsed into `policy_id`, means a decoder bump does
//! not needlessly churn unrelated rows. The `policy_id` is DERIVED from the policy
//! parameters, so changing a constant cannot silently reuse a stale cache row.
