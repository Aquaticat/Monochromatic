//! The engine already throttles media-position messages by playback seconds, but

//! module keeps the UI seek bar and the desktop taskbar progress from being
//! repainted for every reset while still allowing play-state changes through

/// What:     `use std::time::Duration;`. A standard-library span of time. Siblings a
///           TS reader might expect: `Instant` (a monotonic timestamp, an absolute
///           point) and a raw integer count of milliseconds.
/// Why:      Debouncing compares elapsed spans; `Duration` keeps the unit explicit
///           and avoids mixing seconds with milliseconds.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// // a Duration is just a number of milliseconds in TS
/// ```

///           A public constant holding the minimum gap between ordinary progress
///           repaints. `Duration::from_millis` builds the time span from an integer
///           millisecond count, evaluated at compile time.
/// Why:      A quarter-second cap is fast enough for a seek bar but slow enough to
///           prevent sub-second tracks from flashing the UI and taskbar.
