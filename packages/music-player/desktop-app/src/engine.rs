//! Engine: the worker-thread front door. `Engine::spawn` starts a background
//! thread running `run`, which owns a `Controller` (the real playback state, in
//! `controller.rs`) and drives it from the command channel.
//!
//! Threads, for a TypeScript reader: `Engine::spawn` starts a background worker
//! (`std::thread`). The UI talks to it through a one-way queue of `Command`s
//! (an `mpsc` channel: many senders, one receiver). The worker replies by
//! calling an `on_update` callback the UI supplied. The PipeWire output runs its
//! OWN thread internally; the controller thread only decodes and pushes samples
//! into the ring buffer the output hands back.

/// What:     `use std::sync::mpsc::{self, Receiver, Sender, TryRecvError};`. The
///           multi-producer/single-consumer channel: `Sender` pushes, `Receiver` pops,
///           `TryRecvError` reports "empty" vs "all senders gone". `self` also imports
///           the `mpsc` module itself (for `mpsc::channel()`).
/// Why:      The UI thread sends `Command`s to this worker thread.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// // a thread-safe queue split into a Sender (push) and a Receiver (tryPop)
/// ```
use std::sync::mpsc::{self, Receiver, Sender, TryRecvError};

/// What:     `use std::thread::{self, JoinHandle, Thread};`. `thread::spawn` starts a
///           worker; a `JoinHandle` lets us wait for it to finish; a `Thread` is a cheap,
///           cloneable HANDLE to a running thread (it wraps an internal `Arc`), used here
///           only to call `.unpark()` on the worker. Sibling you might expect: there is no
///           separate "thread id" type you'd pass around; `Thread` is that handle.
/// Why:      The engine runs on its own thread, and other threads need a `Thread` handle
///           to wake it from a park (see `park_timeout` in `run`).

///           wakes it sooner. `u64` (not `u32`/`i64`) is what `Duration::from_millis`
///           wants. The worker is normally woken EARLY by an `unpark()` call: the audio
///           callback unparks it after draining the ring buffer (space freed -> decode
///           more), and command senders unpark it after queueing a command (act on it
///           now). This timeout is only a SAFETY NET in case an `unpark` is ever missed;
///           it caps any stall well under the ~1 second the ring buffer holds, so a missed
///           wake never causes an audio gap.
/// Why:      Replaces the old busy-poll: the worker used to skip its sleep whenever a push
///           accepted even one sample, so during playback it spun a whole CPU core.
///           Parking until explicitly woken drops idle CPU to near zero.
