//! Single source of truth for the application's platform identity strings.
//!
//! The app is named in three different identity systems, and the strings MUST
//! NOT drift, so they live here instead of scattered across modules:
//!
//! - Linux: `APP_ID` (`monochromatic.music-player`) is the Wayland app id, the
//!   X11 `WM_CLASS`, and the `<APP_ID>.desktop` basename. KDE matches the
//!   running window to the launcher entry by it, and
//!   `share/applications/monochromatic.music-player.desktop` is named after it,
//!   so changing it is a breaking change. Read only on Linux (launcher.rs).
//! - macOS: the bundle id is `MACOS_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER`
//!   (`dev.monochromatic.musicplayer`). It actually lives in `macos/Info.plist`
//!   (XML cannot share a Rust constant); it is mirrored here so the value has
//!   one documented home and a test can assert the plist matches.
//! - All platforms: the per-user config directory is derived from the
//!   reverse-DNS triple (`CONFIG_QUALIFIER`, `CONFIG_ORGANIZATION`,
//!   `CONFIG_APPLICATION`) by the `directories` crate (session.rs). Changing any
//!   of the three moves every existing user's `session.json`, so they are fixed.
//!
//! The macOS bundle id and the config triple now unify to
//! `dev.monochromatic.musicplayer`; only the Wayland `APP_ID`
//! (`monochromatic.music-player`) differs, because it is the `.desktop` basename
//! and KDE `WM_CLASS`, where renaming is a breaking change. Collecting them here
//! makes that one intentional difference visible rather than looking like drift.

/// What:     `use std::path::PathBuf;` imports the OWNED filesystem-path type (heap-
///           allocated, growable; sibling: the borrowed `&Path`).
/// Why:      `config_dir` below returns an owned `PathBuf` the callers extend with a
///           filename.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// type PathBuf = string;
/// ```
use std::path::PathBuf;

/// What:     `pub const APP_ID: &str = "monochromatic.music-player";`. A module-
///           level immutable string constant. `&str` is a borrowed string slice
///           (sibling: the owned, heap-allocated `String`); a `const` `&str`
///           points at bytes baked into the binary, so no allocation happens.
/// Why:      One name for the Wayland app id / WM_CLASS / `.desktop` basename, so
///           the window, the desktop file, and KDE's launcher matching can never
///           disagree. Declared on every platform (only Linux reads it); a `pub`
///           constant unused inside this library is NOT dead code, so non-Linux
///           builds stay warning-clean without a `#[cfg]`.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):

///           Another `const` string slice (see `APP_ID` for the `&str` vs `String`
///           note).
/// Why:      The macOS `CFBundleIdentifier` is authored in `macos/Info.plist`, but
///           recording it here gives the value a single documented home and lets a
///           unit test assert the plist still contains it, catching silent drift.
///

///           reverse-DNS parts the `directories` crate's `ProjectDirs::from`
///           takes (qualifier, organization, application).

///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):

///           config DIRECTORY (no filename) from the reverse-DNS triple via the
///           `directories` crate, or `None` when the platform exposes no config home.
///           `pub(crate)` so session.rs and peakcache.rs share it.
