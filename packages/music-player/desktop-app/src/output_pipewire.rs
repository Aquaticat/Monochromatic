//! PipeWire output: the thin FFI boundary. ALL PipeWire/SPA/realtime code is
//! confined to this module so the rest of the player (engine.rs) only ever
//! calls `Output::new`, `Output::reconfigure`, and pushes `f32` samples into
//! the returned ring-buffer producer.
//!
//! Mental model for a TypeScript reader: PipeWire is a C audio server. We open
//! one background loop (its own OS thread, managed by C), create an output
//! "stream", and register a `process` callback that the C loop calls on a
//! realtime thread whenever the speakers need more samples. That callback
//! copies samples out of a lock-free queue (the ring buffer) and into the
//! hardware buffer. We hand the WRITE end of that queue back to the engine.
//!
//! Several types here are `!Send` (they use `Rc` internally, like a value that
//! must stay on the thread that made it). So `Output` is created, used, and
//! dropped entirely on the engine's controller thread; only the realtime
//! `process` callback runs elsewhere (on PipeWire's own thread), and it touches
//! only the ring-buffer consumer it was given.

/// What:     `use std::io::Cursor;`. `Cursor` wraps an in-memory `Vec<u8>` and gives it
