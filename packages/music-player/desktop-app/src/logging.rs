//! The desktop tracing subscriber: a stderr sink with an env-filter.
//!
//! The binary installs this once at startup so every `tracing` event from this crate and
//! the shared `truepeak-core` reaches stderr. The level is read from `RUST_LOG` (default
//! `info`). We deliberately do NOT bridge the `log` facade: ICU's `log`-routed
//! CJK-segmentation warnings must stay silent, exactly as they are today with no `log`
//! subscriber installed (see the `icu_provider` note in Cargo.toml).

/// What:     `use tracing_subscriber::EnvFilter;`. The filter that reads `RUST_LOG`.
/// Why:      Lets an operator raise or lower the level without a rebuild.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// import { EnvFilter } from "tracing-subscriber";
/// ```
use tracing_subscriber::EnvFilter;

/// What:     `pub fn init()`. Install the global tracing subscriber once, to stderr.
/// Why:      One startup call gives every crate's events a sink; using `set_global_default`
///           rather than `.init()` leaves the `log` facade unbridged so ICU's silenced
///           CJK-segmentation warnings do not revive.
///
/// In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
/// ```ts
/// music_player.logging.init(); // first line of main
/// ```

    // The level filter from RUST_LOG, or `info` when the variable is unset or malformed.
    let filter = EnvFilter::try_from_default_env().unwrap_or_else(|_| EnvFilter::new("info"));
    // A fmt subscriber writing to stderr; `.finish()` returns it without touching `log`.
