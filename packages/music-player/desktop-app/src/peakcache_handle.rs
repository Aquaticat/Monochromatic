//! The synchronous handle the rest of the player uses to reach the peak cache.
//!
//! `CacheHandle` holds the actor's two channel senders and nothing else, so it is
//! cheap to `Clone` and share across the engine thread, the current-track
//! measurement worker, and the background sweep. Reads block briefly on a
//! `oneshot` reply (a single indexed lookup, at human-paced track-load frequency);
//! writes are non-blocking sends. No `Mutex`: the actor owns the only mutable state.
