//! cpal output (macOS CoreAudio / Windows WASAPI): the thin cross-platform-audio
//! boundary, the non-Linux counterpart to `output_pipewire.rs`. It exposes the
//! SAME `Output` surface the engine already drives (`Output::new`,
//! `Output::reconfigure`, `Output::set_playing`), so nothing outside this file
//! changes between platforms.
//!
//! Mental model for a TypeScript reader: cpal is a small Rust library that
//! talks to the operating system's audio engine (CoreAudio on macOS, WASAPI on
//! Windows, both reached through one cpal API). We pick the default output
//! device, and per track we open an
//! output "stream" at that track's sample rate. cpal calls a callback on a
//! realtime thread whenever the speakers need more samples; that callback
//! copies samples out of a lock-free queue (the ring buffer) into the buffer
//! cpal hands us. We give the WRITE end of that queue back to the engine, just
//! like the PipeWire backend does.
//!
//! Unlike the PipeWire path, the bytes cpal hands us are ALREADY `f32` (it asks
//! us for the sample type), so there is no little-endian byte conversion and no
//! scratch buffer: we pop straight into cpal's buffer.
//!
//! `cpal::Stream` is `!Send` on both macOS and Windows (it keeps a
//! non-thread-safe handle), so
//! `Output` is created, used, and dropped entirely on the engine's controller
//! thread; only the realtime callback runs elsewhere, and it touches only the
//! ring-buffer consumer it was given. Stopping is automatic: dropping the
//! `Stream` (on reconfigure, or when `Output` drops) stops and disposes it, so
//! no manual `Drop` impl is needed (the PipeWire path needed one only to order
//! its background-loop teardown).

/// What:     `use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering};`. `AtomicBool` is a `bool`
///           that can be read/written from multiple threads WITHOUT a lock (the hardware
///           makes the access indivisible). `Ordering` says how strictly the access is
///           ordered against other memory operations; siblings range from `Relaxed`
///           (loosest) to `SeqCst` (strictest).
/// Why:      The engine thread flips a "playing" flag and the realtime audio callback
///           reads it; a plain `bool` shared across threads is undefined behaviour, so it
