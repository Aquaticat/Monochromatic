//! The feasible no-classifier model.
//!
//! The corrected `/4` budget is far too tight for a full-scan classifier: it has room
//! for only a couple of extra full scans, while no probe or metadata feature separates
//! the ~120 hot-master violators that precisely. So the feasible policy ships NO
//! violator classifier at all. Instead it probes every long track and applies a single
//! fixed margin large enough to cover the worst under-read, which guarantees zero
//! violations. The objective then becomes: spend the budget on probe density (more,
//! shorter windows cover more distinct regions and shrink the gaps that cause
//! under-read) so the required margin, and thus the worst-case too-quiet error, is as
//! small as possible. This module sweeps density and reports the best feasible margin.
