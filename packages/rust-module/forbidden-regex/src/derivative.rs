//! What:    Brzozowski byte derivatives over the node algebra.
//! Why:     This file is the Rust module that groups the derivative implementation, so the
//!          compiler gives those items one namespace and sibling modules can import that name.
//!
//! In TS you'd write (pseudocode):
//! ```ts
//! // module derivative: see exported functions and types below.
//! ```

/// What:    Imports the node algebra being differentiated.
/// Why:     The code below uses `Node` directly; importing from `crate/ast/node` keeps each call
