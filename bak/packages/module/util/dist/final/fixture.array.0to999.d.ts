/** From 0 to 999 inclusive.

 @remarks
 Suitable as test fixture because 0 is falsy, but others are truthy,
 and is easy to test for all-truthiness or all-falsiness
 by making the predicate add one or minus 999 to input.
 It's lengthy so it could be used to test performance of different implementations.
