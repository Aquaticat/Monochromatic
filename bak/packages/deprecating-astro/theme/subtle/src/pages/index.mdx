Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find
just-enough themes or static site generators for a personal blog. What we need is just a place to post random stuff.

<section>
  What we don't need is: 1. Multi-layered file structures - That's more for a documentation site. 2. Flashy effects -
  That's more for selling a product. 3. Dependency on JS - Some people disable JS. 4. Custom fonts - Could be nice, but
  not absolutely necessary for a personal blog. Could add that as an option.
