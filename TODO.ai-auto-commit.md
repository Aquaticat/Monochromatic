# TODO: AI Auto-Commit Automation

Build an intelligent auto-commit system with debouncing and AI-generated commit messages to replace manual "forgot what changes" commits.

## Problem Statement and Motivation

### Current Approach (Broken Workflow)
The current development workflow suffers from a fundamental commit discipline problem:

1. **Extended Development Sessions**: Work for hours/days/weeks without committing
2. **Memory Loss**: By the time a commit happens, the specific changes and reasoning are forgotten
3. **Generic Commit Messages**: Resort to meaningless messages like "forgot what changes", "various updates", "WIP"
4. **Lost Development History**: No granular record of the development process or decision-making
5. **Recovery Challenges**: When things break, no logical restore points to analyze or revert to
6. **Code Review Impossibility**: Massive commits are impossible to review effectively

### Specific Pain Points
- **Decision Fatigue**: "Should I commit now?" paralysis prevents regular commits
- **Message Crafting Overhead**: The mental energy required to write good commit messages
- **Context Switching**: Interrupting flow state to commit feels disruptive
- **Perfectionism**: Waiting for "logical units" that never materialize in organic development
- **Fear of Noise**: Concern that frequent commits will pollute the Git history

### Why AI Auto-Commits Are The Solution
This approach addresses the core psychological and workflow barriers:

1. **Eliminates Decision Fatigue**: No manual "should I commit?" decisions
2. **Preserves Context**: AI can analyze diffs while changes are fresh
3. **Maintains Flow State**: Automatic background process doesn't interrupt coding
4. **Better Than Nothing**: Even generic AI messages > "forgot what changes"
5. **Granular History**: Recovery points every few minutes instead of massive commits
6. **Upgrade Path**: Provides foundation for gradually improving commit quality

### Expected Outcomes
- **90% Reduction** in "forgot what changes" commits
- **Automated Backup System** preventing work loss from crashes/mistakes
- **Browsable Development Timeline** instead of archaeological mega-commits
- **Improved Code Review** through logical, smaller changesets
- **Reduced Stress** around version control discipline
- **Foundation for Better Practices** as commit habits improve over time

### Success Metrics
- Average commit size drops from 500+ lines to <100 lines
- Time between commits drops from days/weeks to minutes/hours
- Commit messages contain actual semantic information about changes
- Zero "forgot what changes" or equivalent meaningless messages
- Recovery/debugging becomes feasible through granular history

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Git Habits
- **Frequency**: Commits happen every few days to weeks
- **Size**: Typically 300-1000+ line changes across multiple files
- **Messages**: Generic, non-descriptive ("updated stuff", "changes", "forgot what changes")
- **Review Process**: Impossible due to commit size and lack of context
- **Recovery**: Difficult due to large time gaps between commits

### Development Environment
- **Project Structure**: Monorepo with Moon task orchestration
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict typing
- **Tools**: VSCode, Moon CLI, pnpm, existing linting/testing infrastructure
- **Workflow**: Rapid iterative development with frequent file switching
- **Session Length**: Extended coding sessions (2-8 hours common)

### Integration Requirements
- **Must Not Interrupt Flow**: Zero disruption to active development
- **Performance**: Minimal system resource usage
- **Reliability**: Must work consistently without manual intervention
- **Compatibility**: Work alongside existing tools and workflows
- **Configurability**: Adaptable to different project types and preferences

## Phase 1: Basic File Watching and Debouncing

- [ ] **Research file watching solutions**
  - Evaluate `fswatch` (cross-platform) vs `inotifywait` (Linux) vs Node.js `chokidar`
  - Test performance with large codebases
  - Assess filtering capabilities (ignore node_modules, dist, etc.)

- [ ] **Implement debouncing logic**
  - Create configurable debounce delay (default: 3 minutes)
  - Handle multiple rapid changes within debounce window
  - Reset timer on new file changes
  - Add manual trigger override

- [ ] **Basic commit automation**
  - Auto-stage all changes (`git add -A`)
  - Generate timestamp-based commit messages as fallback
  - Handle git repository detection
  - Skip commits when no actual changes exist

## Phase 2: AI-Powered Commit Messages

- [ ] **Implement diff analysis**
  - Extract meaningful diffs using `git diff --cached`
  - Filter out noise (whitespace-only changes, generated files)
  - Identify file types and change patterns
  - Detect new files vs modifications vs deletions

- [ ] **AI integration options**
  - **Option A**: GitHub Copilot CLI integration (`gh copilot suggest -t git`)
  - **Option B**: OpenAI API with custom prompts
  - **Option C**: Local LLM integration (ollama, etc.)
  - **Option D**: Rule-based message generation with AI fallback

- [ ] **Message quality improvements**
  - Follow Conventional Commits format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, etc.)
  - Detect scope from file paths (e.g., `feat(module-es): add string utilities`)
  - Include relevant context from code changes
  - Fallback to generic messages when AI fails

## Phase 3: Configuration and Safety

- [ ] **Configuration system**
  - Create `.ai-commit.config.json` for per-project settings
  - Configure debounce delays, ignore patterns, AI providers
  - Set commit message templates and fallbacks
  - Enable/disable per file type or directory

- [ ] **Safety mechanisms**
  - Detect when user is actively typing (prevent interruptions)
  - Skip commits during active terminal sessions
  - Backup branch creation before auto-commits
  - Rollback capabilities for bad auto-commits

- [ ] **Integration with existing workflows**
  - Respect `.gitignore` and custom ignore patterns
  - Detect and preserve existing commit hooks
  - Handle merge conflicts and rebases gracefully
  - Work with monorepo structure (Moon workspace)

## Phase 4: Advanced Features

- [ ] **Smart commit squashing**
  - Group related auto-commits before push
  - Detect logical boundaries (test runs, build completions)
  - Pre-push hook to review and squash commits
  - Interactive mode for commit review

- [ ] **Development session awareness**
  - Detect testing sessions (don't commit during test runs)
  - Pause during build processes
  - Resume after development tool exits
  - Integration with VSCode/IDE status

- [ ] **Commit quality metrics**
  - Track AI message quality over time
  - Learn from manual commit message corrections
  - Improve prompts based on project patterns
  - Generate periodic reports on auto-commit effectiveness

## Phase 5: Deployment and Integration

- [ ] **Packaging and distribution**
  - Create standalone executable or npm package
  - Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows)
  - Easy installation and setup process
  - Integration with project's existing tooling

- [ ] **Documentation and examples**
  - Setup instructions for different development environments
  - Configuration examples for various project types
  - Best practices and troubleshooting guide
  - Integration with Moon workspace and existing tools

- [ ] **Testing and validation**
  - Unit tests for core logic
  - Integration tests with real git repositories
  - Performance testing with large codebases
  - User acceptance testing with the existing workflow

## Technical Architecture Decisions

**File Watcher Implementation**
- Use Node.js with `chokidar` for cross-platform compatibility
- Leverage existing TypeScript tooling in the project
- Integrate with Moon's task system for consistency

**AI Provider Strategy**
- Start with GitHub Copilot CLI (already authenticated)
- Add OpenAI API as secondary option
- Include rule-based fallback for reliability
- Make provider selection configurable

**Storage and State**
- Use simple JSON files for configuration
- Store commit history metadata for learning
- Maintain lightweight state between sessions
- No external databases required

## Integration Points

- [ ] **Moon workspace integration**
  - Add as a new package under `packages/build/ai-commit/`
  - Use existing TypeScript configuration
  - Leverage shared utilities from `module-es`
  - Follow project's coding standards

- [ ] **Git hooks integration**
  - Install as optional pre-commit hook
  - Respect existing hook configurations
  - Provide easy enable/disable mechanism
  - Work alongside existing quality checks
