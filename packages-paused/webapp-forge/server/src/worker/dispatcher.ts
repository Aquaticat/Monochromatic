/**
 * Dispatcher: turns events into fragment rebuilds.
 *
 * Phase 1 dispatcher is **synchronous in-request**: callers (route
 * handlers, seed scripts, stress harnesses) invoke `processEvent`
 * directly after writing the event row. The work runs to completion
 * inline, so the next read sees the rebuilt fragment.
 *
 * Phase 2+ replaces this with an async worker pool (advisory locks,
 * heartbeat, debounce) that polls the events table. The interface in
 * this module stays stable for that migration: `processEvent` is the
 * single entry point both modes call.
