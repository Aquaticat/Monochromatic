/**
 * Live-LLM smoke test for paper2vn.
 *
 * Verifies the chapter-generation round-trip end to end **outside the
 * browser**: the smoke runs the same prompt the page would build, hits
 * OpenRouter from Bun, parses the response with the page's own
 * `dialogue/generator.ts` validator, and walks the model fallback list
 * (Kimi K2.6 -> Claude Haiku 4.5) until one succeeds.
 *
 * Why not drive the page through agent-browser? Two reasons:
 *
 *  1. agent-browser's CDP `Runtime.evaluate` queues behind the page's
 *     in-flight fetch, and reasoning models like Kimi K2.6 hold the
 *     fetch open for 40-80s; well past the per-command timeout.
 *  2. `Input.dispatchMouseEvent` for a click on `Start lecture` after
 *     filling the textarea is observed to time out at the CDP layer
 *     even though manual clicking works in a real browser. Repro and
 *     workarounds are documented in
 *     `TROUBLESHOOTING.agent-browser-cdp-during-fetch.md`.
 *
 * The UI flow is verified separately via `mise run dev` and the manual
 * agent-browser walkthrough captured in the README. This smoke covers
 * the brittle, integration-sensitive piece: that the bundled prompts
 * produce a parseable response from each supported model.
 *
 * Pre-req: `mise run build` (the corresponding mise task chains it).
 *
 * Required env: `PAPER2VN_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`).
 * Optional env:
 *   - `PAPER2VN_OPENROUTER_MODEL`: restrict to a single model
 *   - `PAPER2VN_SMOKE_PAPER`: override the default tiny paper text

Title: A Tiny Note on Iterative Refinement

Abstract. We propose a minimal iterative refinement loop in which
each step both samples a candidate and scores it against a
local consistency criterion. The procedure terminates when the
score plateau persists for two successive iterations.

1. Method
We initialize with a random sample from the prior. At each step,
we propose a new candidate by perturbing the current state and
accept it when the consistency score does not regress. The
acceptance criterion is intentionally permissive to avoid early
collapse.

2. Results
On three small synthetic tasks (sorting integers, balancing
parentheses, and reconstructing a permuted sequence), the
procedure converges within twelve iterations on average. Variance
across seeds is low.

3. Discussion
The method is simple and reproducible. The next step is scaling
to larger inputs and characterizing the failure modes when the
consistency criterion is noisy.
