# Copilot review workaround — remote stub-branch flow

This document describes a simple, low-friction workflow to get AI review (for example, GitHub Copilot’s PR review or a Copilot CLI run) over commits without changing how developers push or merge. Use this when you want manual control over when changes are sent for automated review.

Summary
- Create a remote-only branch called `stub-copilot-review`.
- Continue pushing to `main` as usual.
- Open a pull request from `main` -> `stub-copilot-review` when you want the AI to review a batch of commits.
- Update `main` with additional commits; the PR updates automatically. Merge (with bypass) the PR when done.

Why this works
- Pull requests are the natural integration point for Copilot’s automatic reviews and other CI/Checks.
- A PR from your active branch (head) into a dedicated “stub” base branch gives a visible, auditable place to request AI review while preserving the team’s existing push/merge workflow.
- The approach is manual, avoiding changes to branch protection or developer habits while still enabling automated or manual review tools on the PR.

Benefits
- No change to developer push/merge workflow.
- Controlled, on-demand AI review windows.
- Easy to batch commits for a single AI review session.

Limitations
- Manual step to open a PR.
- Not a substitute for enforced branch protection or mandatory automated reviews.
- Requires repository-level configuration (optional) to get the best automated review UX.

Examples
- Create stub branch from `main`:
  - git push origin main:stub-copilot-review
- Create PR with `gh`:
  - gh pr create --base stub-copilot-review --head main --title "AI review: weekly batch" --body "Run Copilot review for latest commits"

Appendix: Common troubleshooting
- PR not updating: ensure the PR’s head is `main` and not a fork; pushing to `main` updates the PR head.
